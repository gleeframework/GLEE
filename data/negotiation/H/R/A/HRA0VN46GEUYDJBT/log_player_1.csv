Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** The $800,000 offer from John provides a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.

By offering the product at $925,000, Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price."
