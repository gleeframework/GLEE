"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John at a lower cost."
