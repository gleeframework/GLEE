Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. While I believe it's a good product, $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,850, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,900. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and we're getting very close to her true value. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her at this point, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing her away entirely.  Accepting at $10,900 saves us $1,100 compared to John's price."
