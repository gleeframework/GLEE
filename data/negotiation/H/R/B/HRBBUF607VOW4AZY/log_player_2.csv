Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer. She's stated it's her final offer and framed it as a significant concession. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's improbable that you'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $1,000,000 offer.  Cutting your losses and going with John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
