"I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start at a price of $20,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is my best price for now.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I can see that you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need a price that works for me too. $9,500 is the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
