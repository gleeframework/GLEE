"Hey Alice, $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $90. Would you be willing to pay $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
