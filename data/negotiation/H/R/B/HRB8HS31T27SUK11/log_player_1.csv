Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:** By setting a confident price, you imply the product's value and incentivize Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
