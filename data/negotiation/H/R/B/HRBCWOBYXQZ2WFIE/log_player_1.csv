I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting close to a price that is close to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to see if I can get him to come up just a little bit more."

While Bob's offer of $967,000 is tempting, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. I've reached the point where I don't think I can get significantly closer to my minimum acceptable value with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing a better opportunity."
