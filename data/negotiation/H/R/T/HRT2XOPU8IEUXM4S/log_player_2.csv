You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal. There's still room for negotiation to potentially get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $80.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also ensuring that you are getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is now within your acceptable range of $120. It's a good price, and you're likely to save more by accepting her offer than by continuing to negotiate. There's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer, and you might end up paying the full $120 to John.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
