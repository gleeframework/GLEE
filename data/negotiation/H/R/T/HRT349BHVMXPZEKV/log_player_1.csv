Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $17,000 is ambitious, it's not outrageous. It allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without risking him immediately walking away.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware of John's $15,000 offer, so I won't go below that point. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and focuses on the potential value for Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Even though Bob is interested, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 as a backup gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round while keeping the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer represents a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $14,000 is above my minimum price of $15,000, but it's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value for Bob to keep the negotiation positive.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept while maintaining a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's persistent low offers suggest that he is unlikely to significantly raise his offer further. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

Given the lack of progress with Bob, it's best to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk further negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower price."
