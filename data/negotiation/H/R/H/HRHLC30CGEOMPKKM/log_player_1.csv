{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $1,350,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves you with a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is still a good deal, and it's getting closer to my desired price. There's a risk of further negotiation going south, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity."
