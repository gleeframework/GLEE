Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $1,350,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
