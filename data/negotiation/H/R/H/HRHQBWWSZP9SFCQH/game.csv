"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach a deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my asking price. How about $8,400? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let's finalize this deal!",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,400 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $8,200. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile deal.",8200.0,Bob,6,
