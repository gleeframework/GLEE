"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,250 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still slightly below my minimum, and I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my asking price. How about $8,400? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,400 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle on $8,200. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk a lower offer in the next round. John's offer is guaranteed, and it's a solid deal for me."
