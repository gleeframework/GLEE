Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to Value:** I mention that I believe the product is a good fit for Bob. This subtly highlights the value he places on it, hopefully making him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just rejecting outright. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I can potentially get closer to my target price of $12,000.  

* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for further discussion.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and aim to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the value he places on the product, hoping to encourage him to see $10,500 as a good deal.
* **""Split the Difference"" Framing:** Suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach can make the counteroffer seem more reasonable and collaborative.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? That's a compromise I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and $9,800 is only $700 away from my initial counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away.  $9,800 is significantly more than what John is offering and closer to my desired price. 
* **Finality:** Accepting Bob's offer brings the negotiation to a close, securing a good deal and avoiding further back-and-forth. 

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision."
