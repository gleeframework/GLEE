I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential buying power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get $15,000, I believe I can do better. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $18,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, and that he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm happy to accept it to secure a sale."
