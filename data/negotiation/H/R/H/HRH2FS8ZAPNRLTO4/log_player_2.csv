"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is sure to be mutually beneficial. I understand the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair deal.  My bottom line is $800,000, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that figure. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than her bottom line of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation. Even if she doesn't, you can always buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still within your budget."
