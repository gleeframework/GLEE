"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob emphasizes that he's interested in the product but is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, leaving the door open for further discussion and potentially a faster deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $8500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice's counteroffer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his initial budget of $10,000 and falls within a reasonable range for both parties.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to sell or might increase the price. 
* **Time Constraints:**  There are only 7 rounds left, and it's important to keep the negotiation moving towards a close.  Accepting the offer now secures the product at a good price."
