You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While lower than John's price, it's still significantly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're a serious buyer but need a more competitive price. 
* **John's price acts as leverage.**  You have a fallback option, which gives you bargaining power.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you aim to encourage Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation."
