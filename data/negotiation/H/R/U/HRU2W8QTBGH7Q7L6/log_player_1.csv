I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  It's still a good profit for me and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
