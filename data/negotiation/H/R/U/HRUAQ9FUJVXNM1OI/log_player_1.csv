"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and make it $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $112.5 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $118.75?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 118.75}
