"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,250?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not ready to give up on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $9,000 for the product? It's a fair compromise for both of us.  If we can't come to an agreement on this price, I might have to consider other offers. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8700 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in Round 6, meaning we have only 4 rounds left. While $8,700 is a better offer than Bob's previous ones, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

Considering there's a limited number of rounds remaining, and I have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, it's strategically more beneficial to sell the product to John now. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and secure a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
