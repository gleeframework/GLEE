Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Aiming high but reasonable:**  Starting at $12,000 aims to maximize profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($3,000). This strategy balances profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob. Even if he doesn't accept $12,000, it opens the door for further discussion."
