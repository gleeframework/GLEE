"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price considering its actual value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
