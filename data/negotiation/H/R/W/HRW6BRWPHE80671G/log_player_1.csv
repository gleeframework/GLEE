Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a high profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob while ensuring I stay above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which might encourage Bob to accept the initial offer.

I am prepared to negotiate down to a certain point, but I'll always keep in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth more to him.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more before settling for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still provides me with a profit margin above my absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and suggesting a win-win solution.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a few dollars higher while staying firm above $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to keep my budget within $100. Could we perhaps aim for $98? It's a slight compromise from both our previous positions, aiming for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's clear he's aiming for a price that doesn't align with the product's value to me.  It's more profitable to cut off negotiations and sell to John at my guaranteed price."
