(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is still a decent profit, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $95. It's a compromise, closer to my initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $85 is a good profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
