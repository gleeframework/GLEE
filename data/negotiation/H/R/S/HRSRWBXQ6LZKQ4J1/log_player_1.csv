Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is higher than Bob's estimated value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm counter-offering at $8,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
