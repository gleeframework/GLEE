Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter based on his offer and my assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth.  I'll reject it and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While selling to John would secure a decent profit, I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more from Bob. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price given the value of the product. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer but I'm not confident he'll budge any further.  It's getting late in the negotiation and  I'm confident John will be a reliable buyer.  I'll sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure a solid profit."
