"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to make a decent profit. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
