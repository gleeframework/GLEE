Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?

Round 4

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still less than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, especially since Bob is already showing willingness to compromise."
