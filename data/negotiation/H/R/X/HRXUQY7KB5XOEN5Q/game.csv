"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. That said, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle on $10,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
