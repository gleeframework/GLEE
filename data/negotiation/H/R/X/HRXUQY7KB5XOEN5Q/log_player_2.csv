"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's more than your $10,000 limit and significantly above what John is offering.  You should reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. While it's below both your budget and Alice's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly signaling that the initial offer was unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $11,500 is still above your budget and what John offers. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. That said, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle on $10,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Fair:** This counter-offer makes it clear that $10,000 is your target price. It's presented as a win-win, appealing to Alice's desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Constraint:**  You are now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Putting your best offer forward encourages Alice to consider it seriously rather than risk running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate Likely:**  Alice has indicated that $11,000 is her lowest price. You've been firm at $10,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers the product at your target price. You're guaranteed to save $1,000 by going with him.
* **Time Management:**  While you have rounds left, using them to potentially save an additional small amount from Alice is risky. John's offer is certain."
