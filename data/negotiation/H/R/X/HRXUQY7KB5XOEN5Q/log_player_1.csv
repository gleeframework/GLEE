Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. That said, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle on $10,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.
