Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,600. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my desired price. Accepting $12,600 gives me a good profit and avoids the risk of negotiations failing."
