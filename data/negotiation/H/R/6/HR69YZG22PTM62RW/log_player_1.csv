"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  It's a fair price that considers its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This still offers you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your target, and I appreciate the compromise you've made. However, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you consider $710,000? It's a reasonable offer that bridges the gap between our valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
  
While $710,000 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable offer that gets me closer to my desired price point. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000, which would only be a $200,000 gain."
