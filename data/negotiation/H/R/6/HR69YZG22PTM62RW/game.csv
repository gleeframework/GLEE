"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This still offers you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your target, and I appreciate the compromise you've made. However, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you consider $710,000? It's a reasonable offer that bridges the gap between our valuations.",710000.0,Bob,4,
