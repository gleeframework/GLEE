Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000.  This is a firm offer, reflecting the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

This is a good spot to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Matching Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob, and it introduces uncertainty and the risk of losing both potential buyers.
* **Stronger Position:** Accepting now demonstrates confidence in the value you've placed on the product."
