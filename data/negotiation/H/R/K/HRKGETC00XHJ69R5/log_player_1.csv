"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, it's not worth sacrificing my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while also keeping the negotiation moving forward."
