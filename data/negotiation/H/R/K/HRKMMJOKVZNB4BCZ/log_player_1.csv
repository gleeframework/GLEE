"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit, but still trying to get a good price for the product.  I believe that $11,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer was significantly lower than my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to Bob's value, it's still too far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I think it's a fair price given that Bob has consistently offered less than my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I have time left to negotiate and hope to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making one final compromise. I'm lowering the price to $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's last offer. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the end of my patience.  Bob has continually offered prices that are too low for me.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself the full value of the product."
