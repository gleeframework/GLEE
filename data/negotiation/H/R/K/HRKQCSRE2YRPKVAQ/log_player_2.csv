"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob is going to start by offering Alice $8,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and might be appealing to Alice if she wants to make a quick sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is going to increase his counteroffer to $9,000. This is still a good deal for him, and it's getting closer to Alice's bottom line. He hopes that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's a better deal than selling to John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is coming down in price, but she's still above Bob's maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed price that Bob can afford."
