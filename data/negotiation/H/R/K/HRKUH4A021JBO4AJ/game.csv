"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $17,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
