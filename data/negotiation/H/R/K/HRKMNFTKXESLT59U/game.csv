"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I can't go as low as $10,000. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest and appreciate the offer, but $11,250 doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $12,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,750. Can you consider that?",11750.0,Bob,6,
