"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept your offer of $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While there's always room for negotiation, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential risk of further rounds where Alice might not budge further."
