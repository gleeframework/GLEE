Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
