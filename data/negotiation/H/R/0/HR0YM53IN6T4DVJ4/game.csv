"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and a fair price for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept your offer of $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
