"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not in your best interest to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or switch to John, who is offering a much more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum budget.  It's a bold move, but if Alice wants to sell the product, she'll have to consider it. You're signaling that you're not willing to pay more, and you have another option (John) to fall back on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,800,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum willingness to pay.  It's worth seeing if you can push Alice lower by rejecting and offering a counteroffer again. If Alice is genuinely interested in selling, she might be willing to lower her price further. You still have the option to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're increasing your offer slightly from your initial counteroffer, showing you're willing to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a significant savings for Alice compared to her original asking price, but it's also comfortably within your budget. This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with. You've already made several counteroffers, and there's no guarantee that she'll accept a lower price.  It's more sensible to buy from John at this point.  You'll save a significant amount of money, and you'll avoid potentially prolonging a negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
