Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Alternative buyer safety net:** The fact that John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice is guaranteed to get her minimum acceptable price. 
* **""Value"" emphasis:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have much data on typical prices for similar products. If she knew the market rate was significantly lower than $19,000, she might adjust her strategy.
* **Bob's personality:**  This strategy doesn't account for Bob's negotiation style. If Alice knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, she might start lower."
