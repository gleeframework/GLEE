{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This gives him a good deal, as it's still $10 less than what it's worth to him.  I'm also leaving room for potential negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, a reasonable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price,  Bob's offer of $132 is still a good deal for me and significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer."
