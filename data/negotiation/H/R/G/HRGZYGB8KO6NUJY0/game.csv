"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I think $9,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're willing to negotiate.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you.  This product is truly valuable and will bring significant benefits. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $10,500 for the product.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
