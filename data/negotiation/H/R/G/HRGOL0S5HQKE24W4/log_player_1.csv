"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and gives him a chance to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While $125 is better than selling to John, I'm still above my minimum of $120. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** Seeing if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($140) and Bob's counteroffer ($125). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to strengthen my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider $127.50 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $127.50 is only slightly above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk of losing the deal, but the potential reward of a higher price outweighs that risk at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $127.50 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $130?  That's a fair price considering the product's quality and what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Final Compromise:** I'm suggesting this as a final compromise to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $128 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $128 is very close to my minimum of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for Deal:** There's a good chance that Bob won't go much higher, so accepting this offer is the best option to secure a sale."
