"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That way we both get a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me there?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there with $7,800. Let's try $8,000 - that's my bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to making a decision, but $8,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",7900.0,Bob,6,
