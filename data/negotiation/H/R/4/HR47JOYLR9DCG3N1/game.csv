"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still significantly below my initial valuation.  Could you consider a price of $1,100,000? I believe this reflects a more appropriate compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
