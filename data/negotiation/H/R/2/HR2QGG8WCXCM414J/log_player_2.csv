Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a bold counteroffer to show Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget. It's not ideal, but it's better than buying from John at the same price.  There's no guarantee you can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, so it's best to accept and secure the product."
