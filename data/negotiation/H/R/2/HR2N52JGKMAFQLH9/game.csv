"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,500 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to $7,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is a compromise that should be more appealing to both of us. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
