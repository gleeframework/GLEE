Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds this price point for you in the long run. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" and how it ""exceeds this price point in the long run,"" you aim to appeal to Bob's potential gains and justify the high price. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially negotiate a price higher than John's offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room to secure a deal with Bob before resorting to your guaranteed sale to John."
