"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your perspective.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
