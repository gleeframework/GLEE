"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the ""amazing"" nature of the product could make Bob think it's worth more to him than he initially thought. 
* **Leaving room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation before potentially having to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I still have 8 rounds left. I can counteroffer and try to get a better price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, considering your interest. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer but not too low:**  $9,000 is still above Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** The message stresses a ""fair price for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive Language:**  Maintaining a friendly tone can keep the negotiations going smoothly. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price and John is a backup option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500. This is the highest amount I can afford, considering my budget constraints. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  We have six rounds left, and I can continue to counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $12,000 provides leverage in negotiations. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance Bob might increase his offer further if he really wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increasing offer.  I'm still looking for a price closer to my value. How about $9,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the offer slightly:** I'm raising my offer by $1,000, showing I'm willing to compromise, but not by too much.
* **Maintain emphasis on value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value could make him more willing to pay a bit more.
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" aiming to build rapport and encourage further negotiations.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price and John is a backup option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've done my best to accommodate your needs, Alice. However, I can't go beyond $8,500. It's a fair price for both parties, considering the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We're down to four rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to go much higher.
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  John is willing to pay $12,000, which is much closer to my desired price and far exceeds Bob's offer. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks not reaching an agreement and losing out on a good price with John.
* **Minimizing loss:**  While I would prefer to sell at my desired price, selling to John will minimize the loss compared to selling to Bob at $8,500."
