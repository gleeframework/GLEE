"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
