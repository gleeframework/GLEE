"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $900,000 is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'd get. However, I'm still trying to recoup some of my investment. How about $950,000? This is a compromise I'm willing to make to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $935,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $925,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'm offering you the product for $930,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about $915,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,8,
