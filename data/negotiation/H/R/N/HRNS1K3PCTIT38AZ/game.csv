"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a perfect fit for your needs and it's worth a lot more than my asking price.  I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me, but I do like the product. How about we start at $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth would be $13,000. How about we meet in the middle?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While I agree the product has value,  $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. How about we settle on $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
