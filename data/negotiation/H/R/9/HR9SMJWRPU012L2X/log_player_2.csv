"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice's offer is $9,500.  There's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have a backup option with John, so there's no rush to accept Alice's offer.
* **Negotiation is possible:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your ideal price, it's still above your preferred $8,500.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  You have John as a fallback option, giving you more leverage in negotiations.
* **Further negotiation is likely:** You can likely get closer to your desired price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8750 just yet. I can offer you a price of $8900. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  She's now offering $8,900, which is only $200 away from your counteroffer of $8,750.
* **The gap is small:**  At this point, the difference in price is relatively small, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort.
* **John's offer is a backup:** You still have John's offer as a fallback if this deal falls through.

Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, accepting $8,900 is a good deal, especially considering John's offer."
