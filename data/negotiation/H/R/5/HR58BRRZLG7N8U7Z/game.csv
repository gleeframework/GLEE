"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this work. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
