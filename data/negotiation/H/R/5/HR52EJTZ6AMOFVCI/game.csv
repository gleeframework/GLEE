"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $11500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $12250 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
