This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire this valuable asset at a very attractive price.  I'm confident you'll find this offer very compelling. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
