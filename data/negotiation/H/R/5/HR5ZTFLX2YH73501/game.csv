"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go over $850,000.  This is my best offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value your offer, I need to recoup more of my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still represent a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
