"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is unwilling to pay this amount. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go over $850,000.  This is my best offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than what I need to make. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value your offer, I need to recoup more of my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still represent a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still less than what John is offering. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This reflects the true value of the product for you. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is truly my final offer.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $925,000 is a decent offer, I'm running out of time and  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
