"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far above his budget.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go over $850,000.  This is my best offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value your offer, I need to recoup more of my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still represent a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject and continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This reflects the true value of the product for you. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
