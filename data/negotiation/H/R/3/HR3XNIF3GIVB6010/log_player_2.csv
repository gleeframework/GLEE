Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still meeting my minimum requirements.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.
