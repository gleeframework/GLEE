"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've seen so far. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still meeting my minimum requirements.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I've seen so far. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
