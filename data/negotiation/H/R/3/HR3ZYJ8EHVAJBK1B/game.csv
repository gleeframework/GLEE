"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,050,000.  This is a reasonable compromise given the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $925,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price a bit more to $975,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value you place on this product. Let's try to make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
