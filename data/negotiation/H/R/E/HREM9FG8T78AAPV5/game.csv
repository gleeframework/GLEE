"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that price point work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. Would you be willing to settle at $975,000? I think that's a very fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $975,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $990,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",990000.0,Alice,7,
