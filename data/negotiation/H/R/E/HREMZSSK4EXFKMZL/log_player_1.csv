Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price higher than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Not Too High:** Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away, making him think there's no room for a deal.  $1,400,000 leaves a reasonable margin for both parties."
