Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than its worth to you. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate because he values the product higher. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:**  The offer isn't too aggressive, indicating you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Keep in mind, this is just the first step. You'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to $1,000,000.  Negotiating further with Bob is a better strategy than selling to John at this moment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to compromise:** It's a move towards Bob's offer, but still leaves room for him to come up a bit.
* **Is a realistic price point:** It's a good compromise, and a win for both parties.
* **Maintains your leverage:** You haven't settled for his initial offer, showing you are serious about getting a fair price."
