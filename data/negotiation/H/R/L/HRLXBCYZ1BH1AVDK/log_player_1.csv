Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? It's a reasonable offer that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm tempted to take the $7,750 offer, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $8,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's finalize this before I have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
