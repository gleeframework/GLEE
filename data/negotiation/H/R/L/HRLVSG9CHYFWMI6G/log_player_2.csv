"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Since I have 10 rounds and the alternative is $15,000, I'm not under immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and we're now at $11,000.  It's still within my budget, and I'm not sure how much further she'll go.  While I could try to counter again, there's a chance she'll reject and I'll have to pay John's higher price. This offer is a good compromise."
