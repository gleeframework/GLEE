"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $120 is much higher than both your maximum price ($80) and what John offers ($80). Buying from John is the most financially sensible option."
