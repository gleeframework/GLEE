,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 for it at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, so let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",13500.0,Alice,5,
