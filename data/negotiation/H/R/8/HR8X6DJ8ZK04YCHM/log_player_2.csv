"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,100,000.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John would cost $1,200,000.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
