I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This gives me a potential profit of $30 over my minimum acceptable price. While I don't know what the product is worth to Bob, this offer gives him a chance to get it for a price that might be attractive, while still allowing me to maximize my potential earnings. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
