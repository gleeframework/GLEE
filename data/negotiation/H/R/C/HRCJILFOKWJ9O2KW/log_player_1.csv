Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a substantial loss. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's offer. It still allows me to earn a profit while demonstrating flexibility in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's clear we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed profit, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
