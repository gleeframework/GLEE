"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $7,750? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $8,250? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of its value.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $8,000. How about $7,900? That's a firm offer on my end.",7900.0,Bob,6,
