"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a reasonable acquisition cost.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I can afford, I still feel that there's room for compromise. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. This price allows us to reach an agreement that respects both the value of the product and my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it's a very competitive offer given the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I would like to counter with a price of $960,000. This offers a slight compromise that I believe respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",960000.0,Bob,6,
