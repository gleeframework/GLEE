"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You are willing to spend no more than $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice's offer is above her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so there's potential to find a price that works for both of you.
* **Buying from John is your backup plan.**  You can always buy from John, but it's more expensive, so negotiation is the better strategy."

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to invest a bit less, but I'm still confident this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,280,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** Alice moved closer to your initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still more expensive.**  While you could go higher, accepting Alice's offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
