"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your interest.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to reach a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
