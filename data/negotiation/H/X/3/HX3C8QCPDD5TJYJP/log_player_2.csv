"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good price. $9,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially sparking a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. Accepting the $9,500 price saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John, and is a good compromise. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
