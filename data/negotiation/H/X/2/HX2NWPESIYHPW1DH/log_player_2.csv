"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial price, Bob knows he can get it for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right now.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to him, and he's willing to pay a bit more to potentially avoid going to John.  This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate, but also signals Bob's willingness to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice to potentially save a small amount of money."
