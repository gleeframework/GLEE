"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with some further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is closer to my asking price, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about $115?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

While $105 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $110. I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go lower than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at that price.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I think that's the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I've already gone through several rounds with Bob and he's not willing to budge much further. John offers a guaranteed $80, which is still better than the $95 Bob is offering. I don't have time for more rounds of negotiation, so I'm going to take the sure thing."
