,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is closer to my asking price, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about $115?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we want.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $110. I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go lower than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at that price.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I think that's the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",95.0,Bob,8,
