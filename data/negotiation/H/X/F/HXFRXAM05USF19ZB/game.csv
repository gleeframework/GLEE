"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit too high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you $775,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. It's a small increase from your last offer, but it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",765000.0,Alice,7,
