"Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and my needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it brings to your business.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your pricing strategy, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and it's within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
