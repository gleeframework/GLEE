"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and my needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a price closer to $1,200,000 before committing to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your pricing strategy, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
