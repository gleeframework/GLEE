"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $145. Let's close this deal. It's a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",140.0,Bob,6,
