"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
