"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
