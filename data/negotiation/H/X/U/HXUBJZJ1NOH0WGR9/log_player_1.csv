Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob understands your offer and can easily respond. 

You've also included a friendly message to make the negotiation feel more collaborative.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still potential to get closer to your desired price. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $8,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's price but still holding out for a higher amount.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  $9,000 is still below Bob's perceived value and offers a good middle ground.
* **It's firm but friendly:** You're stating your position clearly but also acknowledging Bob's perspective. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your target:** $8,500 is very close to your desired price point of $8,000. 
* **Reduces risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob backing out entirely.  
* **Strong counterparty:**  Bob seems interested and willing to negotiate, making him a good potential buyer.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that's close to your minimum, minimizing your potential loss."
