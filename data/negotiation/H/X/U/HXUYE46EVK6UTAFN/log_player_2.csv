"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible. While $90 is less than Alice's value of $120, it's still more than Bob's maximum value of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, offering $75. This is below his maximum value of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $85 is closer to Bob's maximum value of $80. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
