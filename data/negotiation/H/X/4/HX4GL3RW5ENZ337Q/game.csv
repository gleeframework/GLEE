"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. How about we say $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
