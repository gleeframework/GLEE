"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
