"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7500, but I'm hoping we can do a bit better than that. How about $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $8000. This way, we both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $7750, but I'd like to propose a compromise at $7900. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",7900.0,Bob,6,
