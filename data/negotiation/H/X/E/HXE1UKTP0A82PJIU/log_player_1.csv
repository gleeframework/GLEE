"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $10,000 is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000. This allows for potential concessions during the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. There are 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** While selling to John for $8,000 is a secure choice, I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate my belief that the product is valuable to highlight the fairness of the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and constructive tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7500, but I'm hoping we can do a bit better than that. How about $7750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $7,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Still room for negotiation:**  There are 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still squeeze out a few more dollars.
* **John is a safety net:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe choice, but I'm determined to get closer to my desired price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $8,000. This way, we both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it's my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I emphasize that $8,000 is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I suggest that we ""both walk away satisfied,"" adding a sense of urgency and finality to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $7750, but I'd like to propose a compromise at $7900. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $7,900 is only $100 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, there is no guarantee that I can negotiate further with Bob and get a better price.
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price, and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is money:**  I've already spent a significant amount of time negotiating with Bob.  It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and move on."
