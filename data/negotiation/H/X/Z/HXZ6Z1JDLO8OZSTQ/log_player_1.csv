Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is lower than ours, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** The price of $1,300,000 is significantly above Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive if he sees significant future profit potential.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, giving us leverage. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

1. **Bob Accepts:** We achieve a sale price well above his perceived value.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** We have room to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling around $1,000,000-$1,200,000.
3. **Bob Rejects:** We move on to John and secure our minimum desired price."
