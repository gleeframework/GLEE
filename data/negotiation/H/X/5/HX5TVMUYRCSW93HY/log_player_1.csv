Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal could work for both of you are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away.  Leaving some room for negotiation can be beneficial.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still aiming for a significant profit beyond your guaranteed offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" emphasizes why the product is worth a premium price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't come across as a hard ""take it or leave it"" offer. Bob might counter, giving you a chance to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and any urgency you have to sell could influence your strategy."
