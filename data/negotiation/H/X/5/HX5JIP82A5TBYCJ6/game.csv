"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and $175 is closer, but I can't go that high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $150.  That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
