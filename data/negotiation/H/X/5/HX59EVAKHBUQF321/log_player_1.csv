{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects, but I'll also be watching the clock to ensure I don't spend too long negotiating and miss out on the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to get closer to the $1 million mark, I'm not going to settle for $750,000. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground, but I'm also mindful of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $850,000? This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly more than John's offer of $800,000 and is within a reasonable distance of my desired price. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
