Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500? This would be a fair compromise, and allows you to still gain value from the product."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,250? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have several rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price. I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $14,250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop my price to $14,750. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 14750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting close, I've already had a few rounds where we've been unable to agree.  I don't want to risk going lower and getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is a safer option."
