"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's a unique piece with a lot of potential. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $20,000 gives us room to negotiate and leaves space for a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential invites Bob to see its worth.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and reveal his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** We aim for a price above $15,000. Bob's offer is our minimum, but not ideal.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting allows us to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  We have John as a backup, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit more given the product's unique qualities. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  We're  moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a margin above our minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Reiterating the product's unique qualities reminds Bob of its potential value.
* **Compromise:**  Offering to meet halfway shows flexibility and encourages a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's unique qualities, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $16500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** We're still aiming for a price above $15,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but we can try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.
* **Negotiation:**  We have room to make one more counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **John's Offer:** We still have John as a backup, so we're not under pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** We're signaling that this is our last counteroffer to put pressure on Bob.
* **Slight Compromise:** We're only moving slightly from our previous offer, showing that we're not willing to go much lower.
* **Direct Question:**  Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to make a decision and avoids further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer $16250. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** We're aiming for a price above $15,000. Bob's offer is within that range and represents a significant compromise from his previous offers.
* **Negotiation:** We've reached a point where continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, Bob's offer is higher and closer to our desired price.

We're at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds. We're likely at the end of the negotiating cycle, and it's better to secure a price that's within our desired range rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
