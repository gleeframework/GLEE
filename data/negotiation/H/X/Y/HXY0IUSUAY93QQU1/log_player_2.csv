"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your $8,000 limit, and even closer to a fair middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer aims to establish a lower anchor point for the negotiation. While $6,500 is a significant drop, it leaves room for Alice to counter and still allows me to potentially get the product for a great price.
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** By starting lower, I signal my willingness to negotiate but also set a clear target that's closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down slightly, $9,000 is still significantly above my target price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting her ""meet in the middle"" proposal now would signal that I'm willing to concede too much, too quickly. I still have John's $8,000 offer as a fallback option. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** By continuing to counter, I can gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be and whether a mutually beneficial deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,200?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm not budging significantly from my previous offer. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Suggesting $7,200 frames the offer as a reasonable compromise, halfway between her current offer ($9,000) and my previous one ($6,500).
* **Alternative Option Reminder:**  By continuing to negotiate, I implicitly remind Alice that I have the option to buy from John at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,200 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $8,500? This would be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $8,500 is only slightly above my absolute limit and represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lower the price further, but the risk of Alice walking away or me overplaying my hand is now higher than the potential reward.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now allows me to secure the product and move on."
