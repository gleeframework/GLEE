"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,200?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,200 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $8,500? This would be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
