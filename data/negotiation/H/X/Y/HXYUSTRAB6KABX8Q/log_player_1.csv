Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $12,000 gives you room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, while still securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value to Bob encourages him to accept the offer rather than risk losing out.
* **Alternative:** By stating your minimum acceptable price is $8,000, you give the impression that you are willing to go lower if he negotiates."
