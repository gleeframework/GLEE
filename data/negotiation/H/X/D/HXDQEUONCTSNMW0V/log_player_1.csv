Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Knowing how valuable it would be for you, I'm offering it at $925,000. This is a unique chance to acquire [product name] and leverage its full potential."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much profit as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above John's offer of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob saves:**  He gets the product for $75,000 less than his perceived value.
    * **Alice profits:** Alice earns $125,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. 

By starting at a strong but reasonable price, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation and maximizes her potential profit."
