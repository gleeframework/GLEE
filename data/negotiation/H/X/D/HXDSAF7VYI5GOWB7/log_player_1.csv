Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the price is beneficial to both of us. This can encourage Bob to accept and avoid a drawn-out negotiation.
* **Ready for Counter-Offers:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, and I'll be able to adjust my price accordingly while keeping my minimum in mind. 
* **Safety Net:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000, which is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this to my advantage in the next round of negotiation. 
* **Higher Potential with John:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate by reducing my price from the previous offer.
* **Stay Above Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on significant value.
* **Appeal to the Deal:** I emphasize the ""meeting in the middle"" aspect, making it sound like a win-win situation.
* **Positive and Assertive:** The message is positive and assertive, conveying my confidence in the value of the product and the fairness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let's see if we can make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  There's a significant gap between our desired prices, and further negotiation might not be fruitful. 
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result. 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gains are limited, and the risk of further price concessions is high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
