Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,500 is greater than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's losing too much.
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, which could make Bob think you're not serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price point. You want to push for something closer to your original offer.  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows you to make a new counteroffer that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12750. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is not your ideal price, it's still a significant profit compared to selling to John for $10,000. There's a good chance that further negotiations will lead to a lower price, and it's risky to push for more."
