"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for this product."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $13,500, which is a more reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While $9,500 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for a quick sale. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing signs of being willing to negotiate down, but her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum budget and John's price. Calling her bluff might make her more flexible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I could consider $10,500, but that's my absolute limit. "", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counter-offer shows you're serious but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Close to your limit:** Offering slightly above your John fallback ($10,000) gives you a small bargaining buffer. 
* **Deadline pressure:**  By not mentioning another buyer, you subtly challenge her ""final offer"" claim. Alice may be more inclined to accept a price closer to your offer if she believes she might lose the sale altogether."
