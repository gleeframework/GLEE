"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $17,000.  I believe this is a fair price reflecting the true worth of the product. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $14,500? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,
