Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
