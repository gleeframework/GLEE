{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can secure a deal close to my desired price without risking losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value of your product. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet the $1,125,000 price point. I would like to propose $1,110,000 as a compromise. I hope this offers a path forward for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,110,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate, especially since I can sell to John for $1,200,000 if this deal falls through."
