"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value of your product. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet the $1,125,000 price point.
