"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving me a better understanding of his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to raise his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell at this point. While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance he'll reject my next counteroffer. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John."
