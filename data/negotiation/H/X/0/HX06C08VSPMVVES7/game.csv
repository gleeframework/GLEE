"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $8,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,500? That would be a great price for me and would help me finalize the purchase.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
