"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable for your business. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, but this is a starting point that reflects the value I see in this deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This price allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your ongoing interest in this product.  However, I'm still not quite there with your offer. To ensure a successful deal for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This price is a significant move towards your offer, and it's a price I believe reflects the value we both recognize in this opportunity. Let's close this deal and move forward.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Can you consider this offer?",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your continued interest in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $805,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's make this happen.",805000.0,Alice,7,
