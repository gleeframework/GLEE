``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You can likely negotiate a better price, and it's worth trying to save more money.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to your desired $1,000,000 range."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the dialogue open and allows you to continue bargaining for a lower price.  You might be able to secure a deal even closer to your target of $1,000,000."
