"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction. What do you say?",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,260,000. I'm willing to offer $1,270,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
