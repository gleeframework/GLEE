"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I still need to ensure I get a fair value for this product.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,050,000?  This price still leaves a significant profit margin for you, while giving me a more comfortable return.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
