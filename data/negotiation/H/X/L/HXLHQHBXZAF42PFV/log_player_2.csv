"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to get a good price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price.** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to bring the price down closer to your target.
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This would still give you a significant profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $950000? This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my initial asking price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You are aiming for a price closer to $900,000, and she's offering $950,000. 
* **Rejecting allows further negotiation.** There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counter with a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** You can always buy from John if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.** She's now offering $937,500, which is only $12,500 higher than your last counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.**  You've been able to bring the price down significantly, and pushing further risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Buying from John is a less attractive option now.**  The price difference between Alice's offer and John's offer is now $262,500, making Alice's offer significantly more appealing.

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best way to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out."
