Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to get a good price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. This would still give you a significant profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not giving up on this deal. $900,000 is still a good price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $950,000? This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my initial asking price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $925000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. $925,000 is close to what I want, but I'm hoping to get just a little bit more.  I'll counter with a price that's in the middle of our last two offers."
