"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Could we possibly meet closer to that amount? Perhaps $122 or $123?",122.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work.  $122 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $124? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",124.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my budget. Could we consider $123 as the final price for the product?",123.0,Bob,6,
