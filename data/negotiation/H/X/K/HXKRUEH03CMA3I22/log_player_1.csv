Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, making it a potential deal for him.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value your product. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below your minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **You have a better alternative:**  You can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, making this option much more appealing.
* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to reach a price closer to your desired value.

**Next Steps:**

You will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your minimum value while still considering his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Would you consider $950,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  You are trying to meet Bob halfway while still staying above your minimum value.  $950,000 is a compromise that shows flexibility but doesn't sacrifice too much of your potential profit.
* **Messaging:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. It acknowledges Bob's budget but reiterates your need for a higher price.

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  If Bob accepts, you get a good deal. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  If Bob rejects, you can make another counteroffer and potentially work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $900,000 is still below your minimum value of $1,200,000. While closer, it's not enough to justify selling the product.
* **Negotiation leverage:** You have a strong position because you can sell to John for a significantly higher price. This gives you leverage to push for a better deal.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value or even secure a higher price than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

You will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to your minimum or even above it, considering the potential for a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  You are trying to push Bob towards a price that is closer to your minimum while still being within a reasonable range for both of you.  $975,000 is a strong offer that shows you're flexible but still value the product.
* **Messaging:** The message is direct and focuses on the finality of the offer. It emphasizes the compromise you have made and sets the expectation for a definitive decision. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** By making a strong counteroffer, you are increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John. 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Push for a more favorable deal:** It attempts to bring Bob closer to your desired price.
* **Create urgency:** By suggesting it's a final offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintain leverage:** It reminds Bob that you have a backup option in John."
