"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is a good starting point, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000 and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is both beneficial and within his budget. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and Bob ultimately paying more from John makes this a good opportunity to close the deal."
