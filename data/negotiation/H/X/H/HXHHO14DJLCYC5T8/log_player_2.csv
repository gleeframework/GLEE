You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're willing to spend $1,500,000 at most, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is your fallback option.**  While it's at your maximum, it's still a better option than accepting Alice's offer and exceeding your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with John or potentially find another seller who might offer a lower price."
