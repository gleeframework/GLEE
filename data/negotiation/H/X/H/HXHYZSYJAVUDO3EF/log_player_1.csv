Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I can likely get a better price by counteroffering. I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more. John is a good backup option, but I don't want to settle for less if I think I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
