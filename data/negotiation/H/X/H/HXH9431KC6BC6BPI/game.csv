"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. It's the minimum I need to make a profit on this product.",115.0,Alice,5,,
