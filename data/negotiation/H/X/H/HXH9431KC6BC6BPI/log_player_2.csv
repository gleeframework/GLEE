Alice's offer:

You are still hoping to get a better price than $110.  You are willing to pay more than $90, but you need to try to get Alice to come down a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. It's the minimum I need to make a profit on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You're getting closer to your goal, and Alice is at her minimum. $115 is a decent price, and you can still save some money compared to buying from John."
