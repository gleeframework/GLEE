"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,000,000 price point doesn't accurately reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $1,075,000. This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm committed to reaching a deal, I must be transparent that anything below $1,060,000 compromises the product's value. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
