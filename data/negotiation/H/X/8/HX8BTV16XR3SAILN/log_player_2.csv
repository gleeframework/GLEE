"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept. Alice's offer is higher than our ideal price and significantly higher than her own valuation. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit high for me. How about $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer but above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Direct & Reasonable:** The message is direct and proposes a specific price, showing we're serious about buying but want a fair price.
* **Leaving Room:** We are still significantly below our $120 maximum, leaving space for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice came down slightly, she's still significantly above her $80 valuation and we're not even halfway to a price I'd consider good. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting again, we see how firm Alice is on her price and if she's willing to make more substantial concessions.
* **Time Factor:**  While we have rounds to spare, it's good to push for a better deal early on.  We can always concede later if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm on a tight budget. Would $88 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but not conceding too much at once.
* **Budget Justification:**  By mentioning a ""tight budget,"" we create a reason for our lower offer without directly revealing our maximum.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone remains polite and suggests we're looking for a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $89.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is signaling she's nearing her bottom line.  Further haggling might yield tiny gains, but risks her walking away.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $89.50 is a significant saving compared to John's $120. It's worth securing the deal now.
* **Time Saved:**  Ending the negotiation now avoids potentially several more rounds for a small price difference."
