"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we keep the price within your valuation range while maximizing my earnings. Therefore, I am offering it to you for $10,000. This price not only ensures a fair deal for both of us but also allows me to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Please let me know if this proposal suits your needs.
