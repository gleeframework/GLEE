{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're confident in the value of your product and are willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but you can still potentially get a better price.  You have some leverage here since selling to John is still an option. Rejecting Bob's offer will allow you to counter with a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9000 again? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is only $500 below your last counteroffer. Given that selling to John is still an option, accepting this offer is the best strategy. It avoids further negotiation, and gets you a price closer to your desired outcome."
