"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about $17000? This would allow both of us to benefit from this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm comfortable going up to $15000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
