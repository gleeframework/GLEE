"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal,  I think we both stand to benefit.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
