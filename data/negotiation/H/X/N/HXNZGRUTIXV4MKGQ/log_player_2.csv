"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to buy the product for as close to his $800,000 limit as possible. A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** $850,000 leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to continue negotiating or risk losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:** Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum but still isn't within his ideal range.
* **Risk of Continued Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a longer back-and-forth process, potentially wasting time and potentially ending with an even higher price.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John at $800,000 provides a guaranteed, lower price and a quicker resolution. 

By choosing to buy from John, Bob minimizes risk and secures the product at his desired price point."
