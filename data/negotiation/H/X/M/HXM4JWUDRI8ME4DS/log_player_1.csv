"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum. I know the product is worth $120 to him, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $155. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the game. Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay, and it's worth the certainty of a sale now."
