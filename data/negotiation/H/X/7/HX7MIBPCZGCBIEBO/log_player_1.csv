Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profits. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, while also highlighting the potential value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to use the threat of selling to John to motivate Bob to come closer to my desired price.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial proposal. However, if negotiations stall, I'll happily accept John's offer and secure my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, I'm not willing to settle for less.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll likely aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still leave some room for negotiation.  I'm willing to engage with Bob further, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if negotiations drag on or don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly, but still remaining above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while keeping me in a position of strength.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also using positive language to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is close to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. By lowering my price a bit, I'm hoping to encourage him to come up. I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also ready to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my original budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we are getting closer,  I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit.  I've already given Bob a couple of counteroffers and we're still not aligned on price.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
