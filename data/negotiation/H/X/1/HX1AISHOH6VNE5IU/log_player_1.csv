"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to establish a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, suggesting it's a good deal for him despite the high price.
* **Openness to Compromise:** I'm expressing willingness to negotiate, indicating I'm open to finding a solution that benefits both parties. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving room for compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, we can then negotiate further."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair given the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to try to negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my needs.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than $800,000 but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show respect and keep the negotiation positive.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why $800,000 isn't a fair price.
* **Compromise and Fairness:** I propose a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to see it as a beneficial option.

This strategy aims to:

* Show flexibility while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* Appeal to Bob's logic by offering a ""middle ground"" solution.
* Keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price higher than $950,000 but still lower than my previous offer of $1,150,000.  I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product while showing a willingness to compromise."
