"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, given its potential and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value and coming back with an offer.  To be candid, $1,200,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both, so I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I recognize the product's value, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This reflects the value I see and allows me to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
