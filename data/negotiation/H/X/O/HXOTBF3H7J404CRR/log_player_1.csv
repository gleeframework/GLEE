"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and keep trying to negotiate a higher price. I'm starting to feel a bit impatient, but I'm determined to get as close to $120 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm lowering my price again to $100. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob to finally agree. With only five rounds left, I need to start closing the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob isn't budging. It's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
