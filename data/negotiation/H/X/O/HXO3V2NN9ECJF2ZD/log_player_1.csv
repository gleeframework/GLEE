Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It also allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Message:** I've kept the message concise and friendly, outlining the price and inviting Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. If the negotiation seems to be dragging on or not going anywhere, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a bit low. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $1,500,000, so he might be willing to go slightly higher. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a sale, it's a bit of a loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain some control over the process.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $1,350,000 and my original offer of $1,400,000. I'll aim to find a compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable amount while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,375,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,375,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,350,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's position. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a slightly lower price, I show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll have to consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $1360000 for the product. I believe this reflects its value to me while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my desired price range, and I'm happy to accept it. Here's why:

* **Close to target:**  This offer is only $15,000 lower than my initial counteroffer of $1,375,000.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
