"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice starts significantly higher ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows her to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Alice wants to convey the product's high value while remaining positive and open to discussion. This approach can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly below both Alice's valuation and her initial asking price.  While it's normal for opening offers to be far apart, accepting this would be a substantial loss for Alice. She knows she has a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making Bob's current offer unattractive.  Alice will counter-offer in hopes of negotiating a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,050,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice is clearly signaling that Bob's initial offer is unacceptable. However, she is moving towards a more reasonable price point. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Alice reiterates the product's value to justify a higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering with $1,050,000, Alice positions herself above her guaranteed sale price with John ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $725,000. I think this represents a significant movement on my part and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, he is still far below Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Valuable:** With each round, the potential gains from negotiating with Bob diminish. Alice needs to determine if a deal above $1,000,000 is realistic or if her time is better spent selling to John.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting $725,000 would be a significant loss, and Alice wants to signal to Bob that she's willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This reflects my strong desire to reach an agreement, while also recognizing the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:**  By stating this is her ""final offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and puts pressure on Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Significant Concession:** This offer represents a considerable drop from her previous position and a compromise on her desired price.
* **Above Guaranteed Value:** Importantly, it remains slightly above the $1,000,000 she can get from John, providing a small incentive for Bob to accept. 
* **Clear Communication:** Alice is clearly communicating her position and leaving little room for misinterpretation, making Bob fully aware of the stakes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but that offer is still a bit rich for me. To meet you closer to the middle, I could do $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is his ""final offer"" and the top of his budget. It's highly unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a diminishing return. Alice has a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which is now more attractive than Bob's best offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While there are rounds remaining, securing a deal with John now eliminates further risk and uncertainty.  

By choosing to sell to John, Alice guarantees the best possible outcome for herself."
