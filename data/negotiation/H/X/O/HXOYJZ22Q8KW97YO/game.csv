"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,050,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $725,000. I think this represents a significant movement on my part and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial. I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This reflects my strong desire to reach an agreement, while also recognizing the product's true value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but that offer is still a bit rich for me. To meet you closer to the middle, I could do $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
