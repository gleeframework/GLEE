Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a price he finds acceptable while still earning you a profit above your guaranteed sale. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By mentioning that the product will be offered to others, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
