Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. My initial offer is $1,750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe I can improve Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $1,400,000. The product's value is significant, and I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell the product and have multiple rounds left. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially as Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. The product's unique features and value are significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,550,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within a reasonable range. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000.  This is a fair offer considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at $1,525,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try for a bit more, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk Bob might back out entirely or his offer could get even lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
