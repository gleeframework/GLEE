"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
