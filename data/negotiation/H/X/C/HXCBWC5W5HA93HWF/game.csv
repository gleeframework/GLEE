,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I value your offer, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $780,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's try to find common ground here.",780000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $780,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $760,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",760000.0,Bob,4,
