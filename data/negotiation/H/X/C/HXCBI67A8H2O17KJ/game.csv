"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
