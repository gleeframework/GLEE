"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept.  My goal is to gauge his interest and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds. I also want to keep in mind that I have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  It's worth noting that selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I'm hoping I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There are still several rounds remaining, and I have the backup option of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm offering $15,500, which is just a little higher than my minimum. Since Bob seems to be coming down in his offers, I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that he might accept. I'm getting closer to my minimum, and with only a few rounds left, I want to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are halfway through the rounds, and Bob is not budging from his offer of $13,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that time is running out. It's time to take the safe option and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum price and don't risk losing out on a better deal later."
