Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By not asking for the full $15,000 value to Bob, it leaves room for him to counteroffer and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It signals you're serious about selling to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially get closer to your desired price of $14,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price.  How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a decent compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000 and only slightly lower than your last offer of $13,500.
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting this offer keeps the relationship with Bob positive, which could lead to future business opportunities.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, especially if Bob is unwilling to budge further.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good price, keep the negotiation positive, and avoid the risk of a lengthy bargaining process."
