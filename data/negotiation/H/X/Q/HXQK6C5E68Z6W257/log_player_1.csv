"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still below my minimum. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially earn closer to my ideal price. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's worth. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum while leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob, and I'm expressing a willingness to work with him. This should show that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to give it away at a huge discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at his perceived value for the product. While it's not ideal for me, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000.  The negotiation has gone through several rounds, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
