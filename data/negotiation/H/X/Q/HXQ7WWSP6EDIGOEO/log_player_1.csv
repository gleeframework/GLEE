Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $19,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, it's ideal to secure a deal with Bob if the price is right. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!"
