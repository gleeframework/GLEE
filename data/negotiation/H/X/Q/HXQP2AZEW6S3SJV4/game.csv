"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000.  This feels like a fair price that recognizes the product's value while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
