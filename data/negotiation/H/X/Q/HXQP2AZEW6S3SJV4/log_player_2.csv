"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you. I propose a starting price of $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to pay no more than $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is already at $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, and rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. However, it's still within the range you're willing to pay.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message highlights your willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Setting a clear price point:** This establishes your starting point for negotiation, giving Alice a concrete number to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's still above your target price range. 
* **More negotiation is possible.**  You have several rounds remaining, and with continued negotiation, you may be able to secure a price closer to your target.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** If negotiations continue to stall, you have the option of buying from John as a last resort."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000.  This feels like a fair price that recognizes the product's value while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing your offer:**  This shows you're serious about reaching an agreement and are willing to move closer to Alice's price.
* **Maintaining your position:**  The offer is still below Alice's price, demonstrating that you are not willing to overpay.
* **Clear communication:**  The message reiterates your desire to find a fair price that works for both parties."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $1,000,000 is less than your maximum price of $1,200,000, making it a financially viable option.
* **Alice's final offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, which implies there is little room for further negotiation.
* **Time pressure:** While you have remaining rounds, it's not guaranteed that Alice will budge further.  Accepting the offer secures the product and avoids risking further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While there's always a chance you could get a lower price, the risk of losing the product to John or getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation is too high."
