"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you. I propose a starting price of $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize profit. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above our minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's enthusiasm and provides insight into his perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the John ($800,000) option in mind as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's message indicates room for movement.  Rejecting this offer signals we believe the product is worth more and encourages him to improve his offer. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to the middle ground by decreasing our price by $75,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exceptional value"" and ""potential benefits"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us above the $1,000,000 mark, leaving room for potential further negotiation while aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000.  This feels like a fair price that recognizes the product's value while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to the $1,000,000 mark.  While $975,000 is tempting, we still have room to negotiate and time on our side. By rejecting, we signal that we believe the product is worth pushing a little further.  We'll aim for a smaller concession in the next round, making it clear we're getting closer to our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal we're firm on this price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,000,000 is a strong compromise, splitting the difference between our starting point and Bob's offer.
* **Profitable Outcome:** This price ensures a significant profit above our minimum, making it a very favorable outcome.
* **John Option:** While we haven't accepted John's offer, it's still a viable alternative if Bob rejects this final proposal."
