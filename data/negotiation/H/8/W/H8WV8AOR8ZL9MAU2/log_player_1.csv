"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $132.50.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget at $132.50. How about $128? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $128 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not my ideal price point. I'm willing to go another round to see if I can get a slightly better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $130.  I think this is a good compromise, and it gives us both a win.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $126?  That's a reasonable compromise, and we can both get what we want. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, we're still not close to my desired price point.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to sell to John and secure the $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
