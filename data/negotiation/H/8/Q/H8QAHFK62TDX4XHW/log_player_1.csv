{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting high, but I'm leaving room for negotiation, keeping in mind Bob's value for the product and my willingness to sell to John for $100. This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price while still remaining open to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $70. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  John is always an option if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  $70 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $70 was a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $77.50 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating and try to squeeze a few more dollars out of him, I'm  worried that  further haggling might risk losing the deal altogether.  Since John is a guaranteed sale at $100, I'm willing to take the $77.50 and close the deal."
