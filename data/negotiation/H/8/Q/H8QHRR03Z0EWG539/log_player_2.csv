Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving from my initial budget of $1,500,000 and it's within a reasonable range of my last offer. Accepting this offer saves me $225,000 compared to buying from John.  The potential benefits of the product are enticing, and it's worth it to close the deal now."
