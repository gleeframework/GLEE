{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a potential deal, but it's also above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see what his response is before making any further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $115.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's higher than my minimum and closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's worth taking this deal to avoid further negotiation."
