# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we value this product at $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,150,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price again, aiming for a price closer to his $1,000,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks delaying the purchase and may not result in a better price.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
