"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than $8,000, I'm willing to push for a higher price. I'm also confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500.  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get a better price than $9,000.  I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I'm confident that this is a fair price.  It's also worth noting that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if I don't accept Bob's offer."
