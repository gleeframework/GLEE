# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially squeeze out a better price.  Remember, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
