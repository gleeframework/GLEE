Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

$11,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $11,200, but I'm afraid that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've been going back and forth for a while, and while $11,200 is getting closer, I don't want to risk another round with Bob and end up with a lower price. I'm comfortable selling to John for $12,000."
