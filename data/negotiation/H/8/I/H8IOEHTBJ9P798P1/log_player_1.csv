Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than our desired price.  While it's tempting to take the sure $800,000, we have room to negotiate.
