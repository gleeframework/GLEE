Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening price, leaving room for negotiation if needed while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Value-Focused Message:** Emphasize the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to appeal to Bob's perception of it. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have the leverage, but being flexible within the ZOPA can lead to a faster deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Don't mention John to Bob.  Keeping your backup option secret maintains your negotiating power."
