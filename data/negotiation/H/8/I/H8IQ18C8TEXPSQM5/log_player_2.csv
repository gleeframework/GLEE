"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price as close to his ideal price of $8,000 as possible.  By offering $8,500, he shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  At this point, accepting the offer means saving $3,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option."
