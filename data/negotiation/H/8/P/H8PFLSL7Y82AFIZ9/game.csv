"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below your target, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"This is getting closer, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is as close as I can go without compromising the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is the best I can do.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, but I need you to understand that this is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What's your decision?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
