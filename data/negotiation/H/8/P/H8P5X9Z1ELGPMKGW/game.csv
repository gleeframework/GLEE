"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1400000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1700000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
