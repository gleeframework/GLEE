"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that this product would be valuable for me, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for your budget. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
