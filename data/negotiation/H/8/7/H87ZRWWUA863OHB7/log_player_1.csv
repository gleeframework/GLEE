Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. This price is still fair for both of us, as it's well above your value and gives me a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
