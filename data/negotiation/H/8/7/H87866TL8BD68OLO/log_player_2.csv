"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me right now. Could we work something closer to $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives room to maneuver upwards.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to buy somewhere between Alice's value ($1,000,000) and my limit ($1,500,000). This counter-offer leaves space for negotiation while aiming closer to my preferred spending range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice is moving towards my price range, which is a good sign. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between her offer ($700,000) and both my initial counter-offer ($500,000) and my upper limit ($1,500,000).  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further. 
* **John is the Backup:** I'd much rather get a better price from Alice, as John's price is significantly higher."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise while moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** By suggesting a price that seems mutually beneficial, I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards closing the deal sooner rather than later.
* **Maintaining Options:**  I'm still well below my upper limit, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $650,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm confident the product will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $650,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Alice is Firm:**  Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely I'll get a much better price from Alice at this point, and going back and forth might make me seem difficult to work with."
