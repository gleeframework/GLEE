"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm excited to learn more about it. However, $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $980000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
