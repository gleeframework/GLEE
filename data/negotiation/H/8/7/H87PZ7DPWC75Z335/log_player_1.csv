Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm excited to learn more about it. However, $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.
