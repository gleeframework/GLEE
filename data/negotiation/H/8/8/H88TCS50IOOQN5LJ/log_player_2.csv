{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to offer $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $10,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is unwilling to drop below $10,750, which is still above my budget. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to just buy the product from John for $8,000.  While I would prefer to get it for less, it's important to be realistic and avoid getting caught in a prolonged negotiation that could cost me more in the long run."
