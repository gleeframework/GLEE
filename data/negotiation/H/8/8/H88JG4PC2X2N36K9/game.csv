"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  It's a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while leaving room for you to make a reasonable profit.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 falls quite short of that mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
