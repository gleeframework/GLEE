"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  It's a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while leaving room for you to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges the product's value while clearly stating my budget limitations.  
* **Justification:**  Providing a brief reason for the counteroffer can make it more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 falls quite short of that mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still a significant amount above John's price.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  We need to show willingness to move towards Alice's price, but in smaller increments.
* **Compromise:**  Suggesting a split-the-difference approach can make the offer seem more appealing and reasonable.
* **Nearing John's Price:**  We're getting closer to John's price, which gives us more leverage in case Alice is unwilling to budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Marginal Difference:** The difference between her final offer ($1,025,000) and John's price ($1,000,000) is relatively small.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice won't budge. It's more prudent to secure the product at John's price."
