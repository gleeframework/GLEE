"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to counteroffer before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation, and is above the product's value to Alice. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a clear explanation for the counteroffer, showing that he's thought about the value and is serious about the purchase.
* **Opening for Further Negotiation:** By leaving space for negotiation, Bob keeps the conversation open and avoids a quick rejection from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than what John would charge and it's still above Alice's value for the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away. Accepting this offer secures the purchase at a fair price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Alice has also shown a willingness to compromise, indicating a desire to reach a deal."
