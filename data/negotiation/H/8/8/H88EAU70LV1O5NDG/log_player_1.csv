Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
