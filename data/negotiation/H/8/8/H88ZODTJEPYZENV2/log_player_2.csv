"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay to John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, close to his absolute limit. He's hoping to catch Alice off guard and get her to accept quickly, as she's likely motivated to sell.  This also allows him to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still not ideal. He can likely get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He knows he has a fallback option with John, so he doesn't need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price. He's aiming for a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying from Alice but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still holding out for a better price. He's already been able to push Alice down significantly from her initial offer.  He has 5 rounds left and a guaranteed alternative with John, giving him room to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch up his offer, showing his willingness to compromise. He's trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer.  He's confident he can get a better price than Alice's latest proposal, but wants to avoid a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is getting closer to her initial price and is above Bob's comfort zone. He has three rounds left, but with Alice's counteroffer, there's a risk of further price increases. 

It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000, as it's the most favorable price and guarantees the transaction. While he could continue negotiating with Alice, it's too risky given the limited rounds and Alice's potential to push the price higher."
