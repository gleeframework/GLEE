"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is exceptional, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is as low as you are willing to go. To be fair to you, I'll increase my offer to $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can see you're trying to make a deal, so I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,225,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
