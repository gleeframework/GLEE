Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.
