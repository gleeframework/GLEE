"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
