{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a little. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not too far off. This allows for some room to negotiate while still maximizing the potential profit.  The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further price reductions outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
