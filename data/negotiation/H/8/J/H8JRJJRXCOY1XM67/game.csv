"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a deal we can both be happy with.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product offers.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you're firm on your price, but I can't go higher than $10,500.  This price is fair given the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $11,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,250, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for you.",11250.0,Alice,9,
