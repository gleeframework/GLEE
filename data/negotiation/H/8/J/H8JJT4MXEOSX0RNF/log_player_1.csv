"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm going to start high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room for negotiation, and he's likely to counteroffer. I'll adjust my offers based on his responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and I can still sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep it above my minimum acceptable value. Bob's offer showed he's willing to negotiate, so I'm hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, and we're already halfway through the negotiations. I'm going to accept this offer, as I'm confident I won't be able to get much higher, and it's still a good profit.  There's a risk of him rejecting my counteroffer, and then I might be forced to sell to John, which is a good fallback, but not ideal."
