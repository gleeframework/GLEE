"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
