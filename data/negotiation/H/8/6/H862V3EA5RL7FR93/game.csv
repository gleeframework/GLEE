"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $12500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $12500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $13000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",13000.0,Alice,7,
