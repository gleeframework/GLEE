{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $11,500 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for you to potentially get closer to that price. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob an opportunity to feel like he's getting a good deal."
