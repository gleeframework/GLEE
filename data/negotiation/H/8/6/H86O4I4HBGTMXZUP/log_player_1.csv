``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects it, I can use the information to adjust my next offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop to his price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $950,000 is still too low. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that's more favorable for me."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to drop to his price. It's getting too long and tedious. I'll sell to John."
