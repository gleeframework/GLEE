"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To make this work, I could come down to $1,900,000.  This is still a very competitive price considering the value this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $1,900,000 offer. I am still seeking a price closer to my budget of $800,000. I am prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're able to offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
