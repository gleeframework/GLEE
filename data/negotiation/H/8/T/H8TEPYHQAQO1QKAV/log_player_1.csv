Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $10,500 is better than my minimum, I can likely get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to move closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
