"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance he can get closer to his desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer.  $1,050,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation without immediately being rejected by Alice.  It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is within Bob's budget and significantly closer to his target of $1,000,000. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer at this price gives Bob a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
