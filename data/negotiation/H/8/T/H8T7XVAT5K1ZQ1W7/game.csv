"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110 for the product. Let's close the deal at that price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to give you a slight concession and offer it to you for $112.50.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $111.25? This feels like a fair compromise.",111.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $111.25. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal and offer it to you for $113.75. This is my final concession.",113.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $112.50.  This feels like a fair price considering your concessions.",112.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $112.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $114. This is my last offer.",114.0,Alice,9,
