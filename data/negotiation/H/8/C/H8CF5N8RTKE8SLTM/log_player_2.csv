The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. This is a bold move to see how Alice reacts and hopefully establish a more favorable starting point for negotiation."
