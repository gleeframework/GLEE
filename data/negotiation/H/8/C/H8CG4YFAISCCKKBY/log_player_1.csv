"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion and potential adjustments to the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. 
* **I want to explore further negotiation.** There's still room for me to increase the price, and I have several rounds left to potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000, but I want to exhaust negotiation with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll aim for a price that's appealing to him while still meeting my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing $11,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,500. This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Reasoning and Fairness:**  I'm justifying the price by highlighting the product's value and suggesting a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Room for Adjustment:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation, as $11,500 is still above Bob's offer. 

By making a counteroffer that is more appealing to Bob while still remaining close to my desired price, I hope to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price of $11,500.  It's a good deal for me, considering the product's value to Bob and the time remaining in the negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could potentially get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation, there's always a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer or that I might lose out on the deal entirely. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  This offer is still well above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring that I don't lose money on the sale.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profitable sale while minimizing risk and maximizing my chances of making a deal before the negotiation time expires."
