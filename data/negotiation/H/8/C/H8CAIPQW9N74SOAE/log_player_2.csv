"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $120. You're willing to pay up to $150, but you'll try to get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

You're still hoping to get a better price. Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but you can likely get it lower.  Let's see if you can get closer to your target of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $108.  Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 108}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we've got a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer to pay $105, Alice has come down to $110.  This is a fair price, and it's still within your budget.  It's better to accept and avoid risking a further negotiation that could backfire."
