Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes its potential value above $800,000 but below my minimum.  
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a decision faster.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
