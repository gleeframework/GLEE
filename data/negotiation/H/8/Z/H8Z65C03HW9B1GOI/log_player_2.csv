"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is still more than you're willing to pay, and you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. It's also closer to your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. It's closer to your limit, but there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  It's safer to go with John's offer and secure the product at your maximum budget."
