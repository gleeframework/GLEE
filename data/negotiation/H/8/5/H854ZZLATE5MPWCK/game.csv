"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I think this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you outlining the value of the product. While I'm interested,  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to start. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. However, $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $11,625. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to finalize the deal.",11625.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher price, I'm prepared to be flexible. How about we settle on $11,950? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",11950.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $11,800, which is only a slight increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us to reach an agreement.",11800.0,Bob,6,
