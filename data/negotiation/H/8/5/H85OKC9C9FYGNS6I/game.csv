"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product that I think you'll find very interesting. Would you like to make an offer on it?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm afraid I'm not able to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11500 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11000?  That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $11750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11750 is getting closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $11250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think that $11250 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11750 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of extras, but my primary concern is the price.  $11750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $11500.  If we can agree on that, we can discuss the extras afterward.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we compromise at $11625? I think that's a price that works for both of us.",11625.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find common ground. To make this deal work, I need to be at $11500.  This is my final offer. ",11500.0,Bob,10,
