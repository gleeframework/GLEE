"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
