Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While $1,400,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
