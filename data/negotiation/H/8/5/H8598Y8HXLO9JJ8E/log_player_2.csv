"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $120 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $110 is not the best option.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $105. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's halfway between Alice's offer of $110 and my maximum price of $120. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $120, but I want to get the best possible price.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer of $115. It's still within my budget, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept it. I want to secure a deal before we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $112 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of her rejecting my next offer, and I might end up having to buy from John for $120.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a price I'm comfortable with, and we're only halfway through the rounds.  It's a good balance of securing the product and saving money."
