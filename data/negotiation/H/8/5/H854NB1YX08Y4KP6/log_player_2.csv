Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer $10,500. Is this something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for you.  It's within your budget, and you've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John."
