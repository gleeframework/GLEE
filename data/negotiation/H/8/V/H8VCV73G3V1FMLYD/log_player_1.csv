"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer. This strategy allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's worth exploring if I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500. It's a better price than John's offer and we're already in round 4.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his offer, and there's always the risk that I'll end up with John's offer in the end."
