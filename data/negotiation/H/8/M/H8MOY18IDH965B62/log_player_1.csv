Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I value this product, but  $1,500,000 is too steep. How about we bring it down to $800,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be honest, $1,300,000 is pushing my budget. I could potentially do $950,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $950,000. While a deal with Bob might still be possible, accepting John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 avoids further risk and potential wasted time in negotiation."
