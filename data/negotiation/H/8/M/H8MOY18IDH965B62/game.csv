"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I value this product, but  $1,500,000 is too steep. How about we bring it down to $800,000? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be honest, $1,300,000 is pushing my budget. I could potentially do $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
