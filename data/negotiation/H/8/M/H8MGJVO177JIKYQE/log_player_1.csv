Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys it from you.
* **The Zone of Agreement:** Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price closer to $1,200,000 gets you the most, but increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. It also secures you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to negotiate a lower price. You'll need to decide how firm you want to be on your initial offer based on your risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's personality."
