"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it, considering its value and quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. This should hopefully pique Bob's interest while still being within a reasonable range. I'll also remind him of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell it for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's try $140.  I believe this is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale.  It's better to get $130 than risk losing the sale completely and having to sell to John for $150."
