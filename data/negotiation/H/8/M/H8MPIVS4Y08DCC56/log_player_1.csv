"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a bit."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also expressing a willingness to negotiate, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice. How about we settle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for a quality product like this."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise, especially considering we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm happy to accept and sell the product to Bob."
