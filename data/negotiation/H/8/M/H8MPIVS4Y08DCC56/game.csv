"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for a quality product like this.",135.0,Alice,5,
