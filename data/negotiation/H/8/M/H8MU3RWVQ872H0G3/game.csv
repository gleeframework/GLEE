"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8000? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would still give me a good return and allow you to get a great product at a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
