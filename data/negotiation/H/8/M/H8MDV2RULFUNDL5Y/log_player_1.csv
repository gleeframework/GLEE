This offer starts the negotiation at a high price point, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation that you are serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price by sending him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
