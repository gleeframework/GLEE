Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its true value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round, and even if I have to, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the limited rounds, it's likely that further negotiations won't result in a significantly better outcome."
