{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get close to my maximum budget while leaving room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer signals my seriousness in buying the product but also demonstrates that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I believe this offer is reasonable and might entice Alice to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my maximum budget.  While I could try one more counteroffer, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go any lower. It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially save a small amount of money.  It's best to accept John's offer and secure the product at my target price."
