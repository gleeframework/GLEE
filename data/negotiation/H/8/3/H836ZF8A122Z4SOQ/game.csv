"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
