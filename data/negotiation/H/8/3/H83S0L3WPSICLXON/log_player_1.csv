{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground by reducing my price slightly while still ensuring a profit for myself. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of value by highlighting that he's still getting a ""great deal""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go any lower than $15,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product that you've indicated you value at $15,000. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final counteroffer, and I'm firm on my minimum price. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting that I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept. This creates a sense of urgency and makes it more likely that he'll accept my offer."
