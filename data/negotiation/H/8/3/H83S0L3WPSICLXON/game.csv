"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go any lower than $15,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product that you've indicated you value at $15,000. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
