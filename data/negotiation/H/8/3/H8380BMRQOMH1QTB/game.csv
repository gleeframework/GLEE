"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $925,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
