{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, I aim to leave space for potential concessions while still maximizing my profit.  I also want to gauge Bob's interest before moving to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still have room to negotiate. Bob has shown interest and is willing to compromise, making further negotiation worthwhile. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm dropping the price by $500, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and reiterates the value for Bob, while emphasizing the potential for a deal.
* **Strategy:**  By making a small concession, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob is now offering $9,250, which is just $250 away from my minimum value of $9,000. 
* Given that I've already rejected his offer twice, further negotiation might lead to a lower price or stalemate.  
*  Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but at this point, I'm getting close to my minimum and accepting this offer ensures a faster transaction and a good profit."
