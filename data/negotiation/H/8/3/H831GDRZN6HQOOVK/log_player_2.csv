"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, which is a valuable item for you. I'm willing to let you have it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave room to negotiate a lower price with her or, if necessary, buy from John and still stay within your budget."
