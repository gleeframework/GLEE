,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $975,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
