"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  However, $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12000.  That's still a great deal for you and allows me to get a fair price for my product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $12000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'd be willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,4,
