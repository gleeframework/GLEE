Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $13,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for back-and-forth negotiations and potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, you can always choose to accept John's offer of $10,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $11,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below your ideal price. You can try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That's still a great deal for you and allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $12000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'd be willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only $500 above John's offer, it's still more than what you'd get from John. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a stalled deal."
