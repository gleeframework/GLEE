Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is and how much he values the product. His response will give you information for the next step.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so you don't lose anything by aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but it's much harder to go up after your initial offer."
