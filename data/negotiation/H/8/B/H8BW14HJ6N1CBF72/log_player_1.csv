{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, $9,250 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum price of $12,000 and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer. There is a risk that he will walk away, and I will be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
