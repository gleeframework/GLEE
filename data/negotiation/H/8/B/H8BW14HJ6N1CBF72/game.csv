"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
