"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than what Bob values the product at. This sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message acknowledges that Bob may not accept the initial offer, hinting that I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum price of $100 and well below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob has made his budget clear, there's still room to find a price we both can agree on.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While selling to John would guarantee $100, it's not my best-case scenario.  I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives me a decent price and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $95.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the Price:** The message highlights the product's value to justify the price point. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, would you be open to $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum price of $100.  
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 4, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $100, there's a risk of losing the deal to John or continuing a lengthy negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up higher, and I might end up selling to John for less. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a decent price, minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale entirely."
