# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you know you have another option with John. John's price of $1,500,000 acts as your absolute ceiling.  There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price further."
