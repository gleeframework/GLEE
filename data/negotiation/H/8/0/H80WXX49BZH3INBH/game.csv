"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  $780,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to go down to $805,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's close this deal - what do you say?",805000.0,Alice,7,
