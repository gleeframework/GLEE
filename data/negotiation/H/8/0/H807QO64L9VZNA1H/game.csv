"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
