{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'd have to settle for the $12,000 offer from John."
