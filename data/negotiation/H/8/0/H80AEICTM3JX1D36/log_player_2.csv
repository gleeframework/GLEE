"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $10,250 is significantly lower than Bob's initial backup price of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again.  She's already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer Bob negotiates, the more time he's spending and the more likely something could happen to prevent the deal (e.g., John could change his mind or increase his price).

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal for Bob without risking losing the opportunity altogether."
