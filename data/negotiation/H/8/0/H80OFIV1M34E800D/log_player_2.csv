# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $910,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $915,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. It's a fair price for both of us.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting very close to your budget, but it's still above your maximum of $800,000. You only have 3 rounds left, and there's a risk you won't be able to get a lower price. You can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget and ensures a deal.
