I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, allowing both of us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering $975,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  I'm hopeful this will be a fair price for both of us, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, the negotiations with Bob seem to be stalling. Selling to John guarantees me a sale at a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum threshold."
