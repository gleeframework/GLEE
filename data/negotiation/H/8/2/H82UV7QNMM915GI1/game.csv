"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $125? It's a fair price that gives you a decent profit, and I'm happy to pay it.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $127.50. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $127.50 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $126.25 for the product. It's a fair deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.",126.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $126.25 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $128.75. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",128.75,Alice,7,
