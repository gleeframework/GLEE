"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise recognizing the value this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's try to find common ground at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
