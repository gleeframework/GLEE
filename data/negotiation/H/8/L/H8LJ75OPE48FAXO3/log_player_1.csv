Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you might have gone even higher! If he negotiates, you can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. This gives you leverage in negotiations. You are not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your negotiation strategy."
