"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1400000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. If you're interested in making a deal, let's work with this figure.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to go up to $1200000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
