{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This is because I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $150.  By offering the product to Bob at this price, I'm maximizing my chances of getting the highest possible price."
