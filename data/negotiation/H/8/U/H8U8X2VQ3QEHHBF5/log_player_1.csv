"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than what Bob initially valued the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This also leaves room for potential concessions in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. There are still more rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $125. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. With fewer rounds left, I need to be firm but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob finally met my minimum acceptable price! This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the sale."
