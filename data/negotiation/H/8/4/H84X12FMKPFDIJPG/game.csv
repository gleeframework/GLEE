"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value to me and your willingness to sell.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
