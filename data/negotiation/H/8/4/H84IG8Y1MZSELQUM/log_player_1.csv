Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $120. To maximize my earnings while still making it a good deal for you, I propose a price of $135. This way, you save some money compared to its perceived value, and I get a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding my value for the product. While I'm interested, $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  This would give you a decent profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
