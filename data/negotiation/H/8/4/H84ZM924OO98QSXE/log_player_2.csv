"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  It's still early in the negotiation, and there's no reason to settle for $13,500 when he's willing to pay up to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is still trying to save money, and $13,750 is still a bit too high for him.  He should counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to his target of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $12,500.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to $12500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is a good price, he's still willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. He should counter-offer again, trying to get closer to his target price.  He only has 5 rounds left to get a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation. I'm still hoping to come in a little lower than $13,500. I'm willing to pay $13,250. This is my final offer, and it would be great to wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he's still hoping for a lower price, he's down to his last three rounds.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and rejecting it could mean losing the product to another buyer. It's better to accept the $13,750 price than risk losing the product and having to pay John $15,000."
