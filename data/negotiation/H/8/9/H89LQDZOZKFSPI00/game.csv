"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000. This still reflects the product's true value, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
