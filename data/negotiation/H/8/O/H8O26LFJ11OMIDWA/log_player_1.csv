Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider reducing the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $120. This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $120,  $110 is a good compromise, and it's still above my minimum price. It's better than selling to John for $100, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
