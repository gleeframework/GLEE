"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That's a good price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still not quite there on $920,000. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to come down a bit more.",935000.0,Alice,5,
