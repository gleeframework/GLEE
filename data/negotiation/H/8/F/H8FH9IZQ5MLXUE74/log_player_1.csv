Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,500?  That's a compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and is getting closer to my initial offer of $14,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the best option."
