"Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,500?  That's a compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13250.0,Bob,4,
