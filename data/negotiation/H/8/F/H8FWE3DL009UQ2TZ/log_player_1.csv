Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I'm aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving me significant leverage in the negotiation.
* **Targeting Above My Minimum:** I don't want to settle for anything less than $800,000 (my guaranteed sale to John).
* **Aiming High:** By starting at $1,200,000, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** I've included a brief justification for the price, highlighting the ""return on investment"" to appeal to Bob's business sense.

This strategy maximizes my chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
