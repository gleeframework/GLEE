"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $950,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be extremely profitable for you.  This price reflects a substantial discount from its true value, and it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
