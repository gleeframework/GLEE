"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save even more by making a counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is still cheaper than John's offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Alice is willing to meet halfway, but Bob can still make a counteroffer closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to split the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $12,500 is a better price than Alice's previous offer of $13,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to sell at a lower price or even decide to stop negotiations altogether. At this point, $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could prolong the process and may not necessarily lead to a significantly lower price.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision for Bob in this scenario."
