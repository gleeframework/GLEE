"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would allow you a good profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $9,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to split the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",12500.0,Alice,5,
