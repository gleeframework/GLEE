"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14000. How about $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll consider a price of $14200. This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14200. How about $13100?",13100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $13100 is a bit too low for the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll consider a price of $13800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $13800 is a fair price. I've done my research, and I believe the product's value is closer to $12000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you've done your research, but I have to disagree with your assessment of the product's value. I've been in this business long enough to know what this product is worth, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you halfway between $12000 and $14000. I'll sell the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
