"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $1,000,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $1,025,000? This allows us both to reach a fair agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to try one more time to meet in the middle. How about $975,000? This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Bob,6,
