"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $160? It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a good price, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $155? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",155.0,Alice,5,
