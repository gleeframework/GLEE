"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Even if the negotiation fails, Bob can still purchase the product from John for $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
