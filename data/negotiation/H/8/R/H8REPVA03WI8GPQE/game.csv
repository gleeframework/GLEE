"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $520,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",520000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $460,000? I think that's a reasonable price.",460000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a reasonable price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $460,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to accept $480,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $510,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",510000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $495,000.  This is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different seller.",495000.0,Bob,8,
