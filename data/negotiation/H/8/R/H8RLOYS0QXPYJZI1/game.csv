"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135. It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll get your money's worth. How about we split the difference?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is the lowest I can go right now.  It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $128 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $129? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",129.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $128, and that's my final price. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",128.0,Bob,8,
