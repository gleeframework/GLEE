"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and highlighting the product's value. This will hopefully encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price of $150, so I'm rejecting it for now. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round.  I still have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135. It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll get your money's worth. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $127. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $127 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is the lowest I can go right now.  It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $128 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject it.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping I can push for a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $128 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $129? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 129} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $128, and that's my final price. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $128.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This is a better outcome for me than selling to Bob at $128."
