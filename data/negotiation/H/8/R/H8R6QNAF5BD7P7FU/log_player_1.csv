Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,500,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While I'm eager to find a good home for this product, $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose $1,600,000 as a compromise. Is this within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I could push for more, accepting $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and Bob is unlikely to go much higher. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
