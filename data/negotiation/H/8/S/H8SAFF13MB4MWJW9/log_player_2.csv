"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is tempting, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.
* **Justification:** He provides a reason for his counteroffer, emphasizing his desire to save money. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** He leaves the door open for further discussion, making it clear that he's willing to negotiate but has a specific target price in mind."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I need to maintain my profit margin. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and her initial price. 
* **Saving Money:**  This offer is still $500 lower than John's price, achieving Bob's goal of saving money. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While further negotiation might potentially yield a lower price, it's becoming more likely that Alice will become firm on her price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids risking a stalemate."
