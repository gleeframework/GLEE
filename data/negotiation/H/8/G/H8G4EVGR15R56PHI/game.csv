"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $80?,80.0,Bob,4,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $80. How about we meet at $140?,140.0,Alice,5,
