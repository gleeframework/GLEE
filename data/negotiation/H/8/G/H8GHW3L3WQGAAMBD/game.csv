"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true value and potential of this product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,500,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
