"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to reduce the price to $820000. This is still a significant discount from the original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential benefits.",820000.0,Alice,3,
