Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures a significant portion of the potential profit for Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept. Offering a price too close to $800,000 leaves money on the table. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,050,000 allows Bob to still profit significantly ($150,000) while giving you a substantial gain over your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
