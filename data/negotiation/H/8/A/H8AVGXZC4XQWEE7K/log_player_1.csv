"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $17,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate up to a price that's more beneficial for me.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it.  I'm hoping to get a better price through counteroffers.  However,  I'll also be closely watching how the negotiations go. If it seems like we're not making progress, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but $14,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.  However,  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, as it seems like we might not be able to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,500. This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and it's clear we won't be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To avoid further wasted time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
