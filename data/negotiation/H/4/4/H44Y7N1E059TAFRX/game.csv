,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? That's still a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit higher than $160, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $145? That's my final offer for now.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $145 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about $155? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher than $145, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155. How about $150? That's the price I'm willing to pay.",150.0,Bob,6,
