"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $950,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but only if you come up to $925,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I could go to $912,500, but that's really my limit.  Let me know what you think.",912500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $918,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",918750.0,Alice,7,
