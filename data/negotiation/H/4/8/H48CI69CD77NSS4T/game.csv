"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800000?  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
