"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. However, my initial offer already took into account the product's significant value to both of us. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly trying to anchor the price around my minimum.  I need to push back firmly and signal I'm willing to walk away to get him to move significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but your offers don't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but this is my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his pattern, but I've set a firm limit. It's time to show him I'm serious about walking away, which may push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been patient and tried to find common ground, but I'm starting to feel this negotiation isn't going anywhere productive. I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,090,000. If this doesn't work, I'm off to explore that other option I mentioned."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Time to turn up the heat! I'm dropping the price slightly to show some flexibility, but the message is firm. I'm emphasizing the ""other option"" (John) to add real pressure and signal that I'm not bluffing.  This should hopefully shake Bob out of his pattern and force a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I've already compromised enough. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,040,000. I believe this is the best we can do, and I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is not budging from his pattern, even after I signaled I'm ready to walk away. This tells me he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would net me $40,000 above my minimum, but it's too risky to continue hoping for a significant jump in the last two rounds. John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 is the safe and logical choice now."
