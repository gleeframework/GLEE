"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. Bob is showing interest, and there's potential for a better deal. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $110 as the price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved up from his initial offer of $100 to $110. While this is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $10 less than my last counteroffer.  I've already had three rounds of negotiation, and the risk of going back and forth further is that Bob might simply walk away.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale for a price that is above my minimum threshold."
