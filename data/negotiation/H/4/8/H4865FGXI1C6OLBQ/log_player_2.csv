"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $120, while John is selling for $150.
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
