This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you are still making a profit, but leave room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.

Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hopeful that I can achieve a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and your offer is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,085,000.

I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I am willing to offer $1082500 for the product. I hope this offer will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,082,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,082,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a very close call. Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, but we only have 2 rounds left. It's more likely that I'll be unable to get a higher offer from Bob within the remaining time. It's better to be safe and sell to John to secure the $1,200,000, which is my target price."
