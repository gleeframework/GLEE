"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is high-quality, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
