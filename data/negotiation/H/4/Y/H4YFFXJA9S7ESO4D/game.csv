"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. It's a fair price, considering the value the product offers you. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows you to save some money. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've come a long way, and I'm really committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, but that's my final offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about buying, I urge you to accept. We're running out of time.",11500.0,Alice,7,
