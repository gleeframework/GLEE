Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value I've placed on this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1050000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.
