Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal, as it's a significant discount from its true value."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Ensure a Profit:** This price still guarantees a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Strong Call to Action:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob and the advantage of the deal.

By starting high but reasonable, I increase my chances of securing a higher sale price while still ensuring the sale goes through."
