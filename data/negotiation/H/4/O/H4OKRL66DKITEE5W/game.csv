"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial and allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This offer still allows for a healthy profit for me while recognizing your financial limitations. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that benefits us both.  What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000,  which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price.  To show my willingness to compromise further, I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price point.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit above my budget.

This offer provides a fair profit for you while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's aim to finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $962,500. This is a small compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward together. ",962500.0,Alice,7,
