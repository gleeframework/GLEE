"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening move that reflects the high value I place on the product while leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will give Bob an idea of my desired range and encourage him to counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
