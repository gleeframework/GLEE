"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $7,000?  That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down another $1,000 to $8,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
