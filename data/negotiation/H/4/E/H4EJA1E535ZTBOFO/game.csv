"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value, I can't accept $1,800,000. How about we meet closer to the middle at $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you consider this offer?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,950,000 is cutting it quite close to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $2,025,000, but that's my absolute lowest price.  This offer is only valid for the next 24 hours, otherwise I'll need to explore other options.",2025000.0,Alice,5,
