Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for it.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and it's clear he's not willing to go higher than $11,000.  While this is a better offer than my minimum threshold, it's not a significant enough improvement to justify further negotiation.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I'd prefer to avoid the risk of continued negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price."
