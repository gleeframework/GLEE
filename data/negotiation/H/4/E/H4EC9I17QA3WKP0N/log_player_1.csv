Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $100,000 for Bob to potentially gain, making him more likely to negotiate rather than immediately reject.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Asking for the full $1,500,000 might make Bob immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's offer is at the bottom of your range, and there's a good chance you can get a higher price if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is not a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $1,250,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for future deals:** While you're not getting your ideal price, you're still making a profit, and you could potentially develop a relationship with Bob for future business.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away, and you'll have to sell to John for a lower price."
