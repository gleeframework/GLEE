Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  You know John will buy the product for $12,000, which acts as your safety net.  Anything above that is profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $15,500, there's a chance Bob might negotiate for a lower price,  potentially still landing within a range that's highly profitable for you."
