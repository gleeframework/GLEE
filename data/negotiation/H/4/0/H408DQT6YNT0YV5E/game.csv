"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $12,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",12500.0,Bob,4,
