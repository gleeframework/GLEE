"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and what you can get it for from John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly below Alice's asking price but well within our budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous while clearly stating our price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range. Her response will give us a better sense of her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down, $110 is still more than our $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice didn't say it was her final offer. There's a chance she might come down a little more, especially if we stand firm. 
* **John is an Option:** We have the safety net of buying from John at $100, so we can afford to push Alice a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Alice's price. This shows we're willing to negotiate.
* **Within Budget:** $95 keeps us within our spending limit.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** By suggesting the middle ground, we put the ball back in Alice's court and gauge her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Budget:**  Alice's latest offer is still $5 over our budget.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is clearly reluctant to go much lower.  
* **John's Price is Better:** We have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100.  

At this point, the potential savings from further haggling with Alice are minimal and not worth the risk of her walking away. It's time to cut our losses and get the product from John at the best price."
