Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. I think it would be perfect for you, what do you say?"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, it's always best to try for a higher price first.
* **Slight Negotiation Buffer:** Offering the product slightly below John's price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above $150.
* **Urgency and Value:**  Phrases like ""a steal"" aim to create a sense of urgency and perceived value, potentially swaying Bob. 
 
Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice is still guaranteed her minimum acceptable price from John."
