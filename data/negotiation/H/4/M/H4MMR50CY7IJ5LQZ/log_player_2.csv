"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate a lower price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and propose a price a little closer to hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of our previous offers. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and it's a price that should be appealing to her as it's her product's worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly not budging much from $105.  While I could try to haggle a bit more, it's getting close enough to my goal and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $105 is a good compromise."
