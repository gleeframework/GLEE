"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if I can get it lower. I'll reject the offer and see what Alice's counteroffer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe $60 is a fair starting point given my maximum budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $70, which is still within my budget and a good price.  I'm happy to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
