"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that's fair to both of us. My asking price is $1400000. This allows for a healthy profit for you and ensures I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
