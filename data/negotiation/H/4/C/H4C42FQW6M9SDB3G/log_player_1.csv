"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob will hopefully encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm positioning my initial offer as ""fair"" to establish a good negotiating position. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation moving while still leaving room for potential counteroffers and ultimately achieving a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum value for the product ($800,000).
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to negotiate a better price. Bob has already shown interest and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Avoiding the ""Jhon"" Option:**  Selling to John right now would be the least profitable choice.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 or $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving towards Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and trying to frame the price as a ""good deal"" for him.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage continued negotiation. 

This strategy aims to inch closer to a deal while keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $1,050,000 is still closer to Bob's desired price than mine. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** We're getting closer, but I still have some room to maneuver and try to get a better price.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John now would leave more money on the table.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,100,000 or $1,125,000, staying above Bob's offer but closer to his range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about $1,125,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree that this product is well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm proposing a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the idea that the price is justified.

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $1,100,000 is above my minimum value of $800,000 and significantly better than selling to John. 
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  We're close to a deal, and Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good time to accept.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation rounds."
