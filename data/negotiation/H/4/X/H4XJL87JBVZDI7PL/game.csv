"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $11,500? That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $12,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been tough to negotiate with!  I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't justify going higher than $12,000. That's my final offer, take it or leave it.",12000.0,Bob,6,
