"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in your product, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $11500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12250? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
