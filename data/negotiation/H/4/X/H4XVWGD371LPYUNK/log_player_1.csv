{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,120,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's standing offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling or Bob walking away in later rounds."
