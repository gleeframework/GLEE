"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than the $120 you'd pay John, it's still more than the product's worth to you ($80) and leaves room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a fair compromise between Alice's minimum ($80) and my maximum ($120). This shows good faith and demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product. If she rejects this, I can always go to John, but this is a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high for me. While I'm willing to pay more than $80, I can still get a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's latest offer of $100. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my maximum. This should incentivize Alice to accept and close the deal. If she rejects it, I'll have to consider buying from John, but I'm hoping to avoid that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to my maximum of $120. However, it's still too risky to keep negotiating. If I keep rejecting and counteroffering, I risk running out of time and Alice might decide to sell to someone else. I've reached a point where I'm comfortable with the price from John, even though it's my maximum. It's better to secure the product now and avoid any further uncertainty."
