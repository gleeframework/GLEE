"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $8,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're not ready to go as low as $7,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,000. This feels like a fair price to me.",8000.0,Bob,6,
