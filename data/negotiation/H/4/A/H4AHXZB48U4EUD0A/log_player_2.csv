"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. $2,000,000 is above your maximum budget, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John at a lower price.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and should give us some room to negotiate.  It's also a considerable amount of money, so hopefully, Alice will see the value in working with me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred limit. I want to see if I can get Alice closer to $1,500,000 before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm still trying to keep the price below my maximum limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,600,000 is still above my preferred limit. I want to see if I can get Alice closer to my budget before resorting to John.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant jump from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's still below my absolute maximum budget, but close enough that if Alice accepts, I can secure the product for a good price. If she rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate my options and consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now below my maximum budget.  While I'd love to see it closer to John's price, the risk of further negotiations falling through makes this offer the best option.  I can get the product for a decent price and avoid the risk of losing out to someone else."
