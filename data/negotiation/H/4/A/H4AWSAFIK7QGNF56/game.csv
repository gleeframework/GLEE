"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll be getting a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate you offering the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. It's still a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,000. It's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
