"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to that.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant.  I'm  within striking distance of my desired price of $15,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,750? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer to a potential agreement with Bob, but I'm starting to run out of time. There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm still not at my desired price of $15,000.  While $13,750 is a reasonable offer, I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my full asking price.  Selling to John is the best way to maximize my profits in the short term."
