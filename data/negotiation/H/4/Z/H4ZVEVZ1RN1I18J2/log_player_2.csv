"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you at $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is quite low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on it at $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on it at $10,000. What do you think?

Explanation:  While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $11,000. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $10,000 ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
