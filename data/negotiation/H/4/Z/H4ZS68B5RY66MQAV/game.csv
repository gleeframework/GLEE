"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product to me is quite high, and $900,000 falls significantly short of that.  Could you consider a price closer to $1,050,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a number that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $975,000 is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
