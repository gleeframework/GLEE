"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to move this product without taking too much of a loss.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
