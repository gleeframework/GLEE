"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, your initial price is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's true worth is significantly higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to securing this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
