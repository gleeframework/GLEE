,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is far beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, given its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation of the product is significantly higher based on its unique features and potential. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a solution here, but I need you to be willing to move a bit as well. This product is incredibly valuable. Let's try $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To show I'm serious about getting this done, let's meet halfway. I propose $1,300,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
