Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my minimum value. This will also give me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counter in the next round.  I'm also starting to think about whether I'm willing to risk losing the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still want to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more. This is a big risk, as I have fewer rounds left and John is still an option."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. It's getting too risky with Bob.  With only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can get him to come up to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing both deals.  John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is better than potentially getting nothing from Bob."
