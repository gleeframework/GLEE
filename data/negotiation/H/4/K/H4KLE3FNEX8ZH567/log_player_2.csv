"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at that price, so I'm not willing to go lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum price is $1,200,000, and both Alice and John are offering it at that price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Bob can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
