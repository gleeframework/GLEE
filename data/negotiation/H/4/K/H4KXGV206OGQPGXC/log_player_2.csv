"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $110 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $40 compared to buying from John.**  ($150 - $110 = $40)

Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice,  it's still a good deal for you as you are getting it for less than what you are willing to pay."
