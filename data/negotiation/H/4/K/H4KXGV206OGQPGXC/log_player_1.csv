Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $110 for it?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:**  This price is a compromise. It's more than my minimum value ($80), but leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal (since it's less than his value of $150).
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value for Bob. It avoids mentioning John, as that might make Bob feel pressured."
