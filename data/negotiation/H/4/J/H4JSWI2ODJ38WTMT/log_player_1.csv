Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it also gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like it's in his best interest to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting high, I create room for negotiation and leave myself room to concede a bit.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm using John as a backup option to avoid selling too low. If Bob rejects my offer and I can't secure a better deal, I can always turn to John and get my minimum value. 
* **Flexible Approach:** I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob counter-offers, but I'll also be prepared to walk away if I don't feel the offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I believe I can secure a better deal by counter-offering. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter-Offer:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a higher price.  This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'll keep John in mind as a fallback option, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** I'm staying polite but firm, highlighting the value of the product and implying that I'm open to a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **Moderate Concession:**  I'm making a concession, but not a huge one. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a good price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm gauging Bob's interest with this counter-offer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the fact that I'm confident we can both find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm starting to feel like this is going nowhere.  I'm confident that I can secure my minimum value by selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **John as the Safe Option:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, eliminating any risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and energy, and it's not guaranteed to lead to a better outcome.
* **Avoiding a Lose-Lose:**  I'd rather secure a good deal with John than risk getting stuck with a low price from Bob."
