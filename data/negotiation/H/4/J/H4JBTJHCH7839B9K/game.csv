"Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from the true value I believe it holds for you, and I'm eager to work with you to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to stay closer to my original offer to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and get the product in your hands.",950000.0,Alice,3,
