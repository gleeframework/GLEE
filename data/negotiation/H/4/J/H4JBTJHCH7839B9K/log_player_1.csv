Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from the true value I believe it holds for you, and I'm eager to work with you to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,000,000 is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's above my minimum but significantly below Bob's perceived value.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, positioning the offer as a win-win.
* **Flexibility:** The message hints at a willingness to negotiate further, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails, creating a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:**  Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, but there's still room for a better deal.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can push for a higher price than $900,000 considering Bob's willingness to pay $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can demonstrate my commitment to maximizing the sale price and potentially secure a more favorable outcome.

**Next steps:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to stay closer to my original offer to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and get the product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $950,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining value:**  This price is still significantly higher than my minimum, ensuring I achieve a good profit.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, hoping to motivate Bob to accept the offer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $800,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
