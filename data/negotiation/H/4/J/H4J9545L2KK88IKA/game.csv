"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully. Unfortunately, I'm still not able to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,
