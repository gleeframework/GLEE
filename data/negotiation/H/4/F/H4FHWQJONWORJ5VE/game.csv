"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price is fair, considering the value to you, and would allow us to both benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $900,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement quickly.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $925,000 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.
