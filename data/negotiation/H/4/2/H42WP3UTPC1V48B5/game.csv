"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking of $9500. Can you consider this price point?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $10800, which is a bit closer to your desired price. I'm really interested in making a deal with you, so I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $10400?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal with you. I can do $10600, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $10300?",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I can do $10500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm afraid I've already gone as high as I can go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10300. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",10300.0,Bob,10,
