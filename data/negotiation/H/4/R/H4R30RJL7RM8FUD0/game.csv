"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we settle for $12,250? This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize the transaction.",12250.0,Bob,4,
