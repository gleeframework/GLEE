{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique item that I believe will be of great value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am still not able to go above $12000 for this product. I hope you can accommodate this offer, as I am very interested in purchasing it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has remained firm at $12,000, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale, rather than risk losing him and being forced to settle for John's lower offer of $10,000."
