{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth much more, and I think it would be perfect for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below what I consider the product to be worth, but it's high enough to leave room for negotiation if Bob rejects it. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my desired price and his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is getting closer, but I can do $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise before I resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $115? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $112.50, that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112.50 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not as profitable as selling to John.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, as it's the most financially advantageous option for me at this point."
