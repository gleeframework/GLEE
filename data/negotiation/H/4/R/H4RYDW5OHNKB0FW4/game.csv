"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you and the price I could get elsewhere, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's work together to make this a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
