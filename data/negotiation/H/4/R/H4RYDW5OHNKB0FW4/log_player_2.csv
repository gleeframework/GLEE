"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above the product's value to you ($1,500,000). You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You still have room to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
