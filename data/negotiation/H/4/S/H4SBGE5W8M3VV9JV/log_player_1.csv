Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,250,000, I can accommodate several counteroffers from Bob without dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Direct and friendly:** The message is straightforward and friendly, encouraging Bob to engage in a positive negotiation. 

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential value of continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can push Bob a bit higher. A counteroffer allows me to maintain control and potentially reach a more profitable agreement.
* **Selling to John is too early:**  $1,500,000 is my ideal price, but it's too early to walk away.  The risk of selling to John is that I might miss out on a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000  is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still being profitable for me.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By sticking to a price higher than Bob's offer, I keep some leverage and show him that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to remind him of its potential benefits and justify my price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I might consider dropping my price slightly further, but I'll remain firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,125,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Further negotiation is likely to result in very small price increases, which might not be worth the time and effort.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There is a risk that Bob might walk away entirely if I reject his offer, especially since he has already increased his offer. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is the most prudent decision. It secures a profitable sale, minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether, and avoids potentially lengthy further negotiations."
