"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  It's a fair compromise that could get us both to a point where we're happy with the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
