"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit of a lower price point. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
