Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and we can come to an agreement.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor, as John is a solid backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a value that reflects the product's worth.  I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally come to a price I'm willing to accept. While it's my minimum, it's still a good deal, and I'm not going to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
