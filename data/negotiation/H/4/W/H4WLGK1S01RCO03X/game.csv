"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I think $9,000 is still a bit low. How about we meet at $9,500, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll give you a 2-year warranty on the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
