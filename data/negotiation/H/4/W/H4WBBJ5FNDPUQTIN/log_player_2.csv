Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. How about $13,000? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000.  While a deal might be reached slightly below that, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay."
