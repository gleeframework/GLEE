Given its worth, we are offering it to you for $11,000. We understand its value to you is $12,000, so this offer aims to strike a balance that benefits both parties. We hope you consider this proposal carefully and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the door open for a potential counter-offer from her at a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
