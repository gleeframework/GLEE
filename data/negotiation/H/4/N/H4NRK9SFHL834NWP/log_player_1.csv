Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a discounted price of $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also needs to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it at or above this price will almost certainly lead to rejection.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  The price of $9,500 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($500 profit if he utilized the product for its full value to him) while maximizing Alice's potential profit.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
