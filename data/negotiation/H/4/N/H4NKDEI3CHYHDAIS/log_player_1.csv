Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a little too low for me. How about $150? That's my minimum price, and it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
