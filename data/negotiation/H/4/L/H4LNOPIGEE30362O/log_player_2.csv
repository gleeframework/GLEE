Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,375, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500.

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $500 less than John's price and $3,500 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Alice's Firm Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer, and further negotiation might lead to her walking away. 
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out the clock and potentially missing out on both deals."
