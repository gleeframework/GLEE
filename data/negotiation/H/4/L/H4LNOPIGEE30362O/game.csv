"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a little too steep for me. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price and would allow us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $11,375?",11375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,375, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
