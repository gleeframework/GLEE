"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which holds significant value to us at $15,000. Given its importance and the benefits it offers to you, I propose a fair price of $12,000 for this exceptional item. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value and what you perceive its worth to be. I believe this price is both reasonable and advantageous for both parties. Should you have any concerns or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of bringing this valuable asset into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and her own valuation of $8,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal that you are unwilling to pay such a high price.  There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer closer to her $8,000 valuation.
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $15,000. While not ideal, it's your fallback option. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to negotiate a price closer to $8,000. By rejecting this initial offer, you're in a stronger position to potentially get a better deal."
