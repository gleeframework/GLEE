Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($30) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($5).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the sale:** A price too close to $150 might discourage Bob, even if it's a good deal for him.
* **Maximizing your profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay as possible without risking losing the sale to John."
