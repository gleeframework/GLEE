"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1575000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1575000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell and me to buy. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
