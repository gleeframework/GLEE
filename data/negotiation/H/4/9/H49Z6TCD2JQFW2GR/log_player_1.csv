{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $149 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, which could lead to a quicker sale.
* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth significantly less to Bob ($80) than it is to me ($150), starting high gives me leverage in potential negotiations.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer outright, but it sets the stage for me to potentially negotiate down slightly while still making a profit that's significantly better than what Bob values the product at."
