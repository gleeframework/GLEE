"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can agree on this figure.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
