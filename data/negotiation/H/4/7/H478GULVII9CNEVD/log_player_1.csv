{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm countering with $19,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still ensuring I get a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would ideally like a higher price, $17,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. It's also close enough to my initial asking price that it's a good deal."
