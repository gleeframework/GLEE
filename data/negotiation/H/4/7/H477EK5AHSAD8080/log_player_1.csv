{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, Alice should aim for a price higher than that when negotiating with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,190,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and might make him more inclined to accept the offer without pushing for a lower price."
