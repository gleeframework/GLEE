Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for our item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  It's worth trying to squeeze in a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
