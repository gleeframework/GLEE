"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for our item.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
