"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,575,000? This price is still fair for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,575,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000. It's a fair price, considering we're both trying to make a deal. Let's see if we can agree.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
