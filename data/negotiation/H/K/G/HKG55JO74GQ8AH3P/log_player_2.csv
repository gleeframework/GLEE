"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as I understand the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price further."
