Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000 (what I'd get from John)
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,200,000
* **Negotiation space:** $200,000

By offering $1,150,000, I am leaving a $50,000 margin for negotiation with Bob. This is a reasonable starting point that is closer to my desired price but still attractive for Bob. It also leaves room for potential compromise if Bob tries to negotiate."
