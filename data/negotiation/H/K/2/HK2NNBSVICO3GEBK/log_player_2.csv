"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less than that.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to invest less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $1,050,000 is closer to his target but still higher.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price. It's also worth noting that Bob can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so he has a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant investment for me.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. At this point, Bob has several considerations:

* **John's Offer:** John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. This is a safe option, and there is no risk of further negotiation. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, the risk of further negotiations could lead to a higher price, potentially exceeding John's offer.
* **Time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.

Given these factors, Bob should choose the safe option and buy the product from John.  This guarantees the lowest price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Alice."
