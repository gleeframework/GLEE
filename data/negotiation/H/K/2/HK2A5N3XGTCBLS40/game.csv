"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11750.0,Alice,3,
