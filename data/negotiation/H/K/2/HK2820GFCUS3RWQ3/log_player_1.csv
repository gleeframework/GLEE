{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving us room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I can potentially get a higher price than Bob's initial value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong negotiating position, allowing me to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. 
* **Open a dialogue:**  The message invites Bob to respond, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept due to the potential for a quick sale, it's crucial to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay a much higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss compared to what John is offering.
* **Leverage John's Offer:** John's willingness to pay $1,200,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. I can use this as leverage to push for a better price from Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates his interest, which allows for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to secure a more favorable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's $700,000 offer.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for Bob while being firm about my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to continue.

**Rationale:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** $850,000 is still a good price, much closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still within a range that allows me to walk away and sell to John if necessary.
* **Creating a Fair Compromise:**  By offering a price in the middle, I'm demonstrating a desire for a mutually beneficial solution."
