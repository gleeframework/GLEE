Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for finding a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is now moving closer to our acceptable range. While we could sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 6
