Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **High but Understandable:** $950,000 is a high price, but it's still within a reasonable margin of Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" appeals to Bob's potential desire for a unique deal. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you increase your chances of securing a deal above your minimum acceptable price."
