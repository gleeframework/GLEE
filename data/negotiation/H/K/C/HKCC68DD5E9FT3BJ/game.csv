"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product.  It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a tempting offer, it's simply too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's aim for $850,000.  This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. Can we aim for $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
