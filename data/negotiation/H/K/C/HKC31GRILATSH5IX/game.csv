"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for us both to be satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $1,050,000 as a compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in finalizing this deal at that price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll give you $1,075,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
