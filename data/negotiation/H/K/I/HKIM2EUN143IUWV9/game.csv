"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're firm on your price.  I can't go lower than $90.  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll appreciate it.  Let's meet in the middle at $90 and finalize the deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to pay $90. I've already made a counteroffer at $85 and you rejected it. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",82.5,Bob,6,
