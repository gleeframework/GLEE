"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $120. This should make the offer attractive to Bob while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$85 is still below my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on a better price yet. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're firm on your price.  I can't go lower than $90.  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll appreciate it.  Let's meet in the middle at $90 and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to pay $90. I've already made a counteroffer at $85 and you rejected it. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is still below my minimum. I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems we're at an impasse.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $120, ensuring I get my minimum value."
