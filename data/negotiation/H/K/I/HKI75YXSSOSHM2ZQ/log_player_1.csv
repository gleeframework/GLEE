{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($120), hoping to get a good price.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, so it's best to accept it."
