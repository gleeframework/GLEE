"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 to meet you halfway again. This is my final offer. Let's seal the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
