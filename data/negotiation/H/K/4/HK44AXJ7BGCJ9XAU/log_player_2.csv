"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $140. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **It's early in the process.**  You have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $130 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within your budget. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** The message expresses your interest in the product while demonstrating you're ready to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, subtly suggesting that your offer is a win-win situation."
