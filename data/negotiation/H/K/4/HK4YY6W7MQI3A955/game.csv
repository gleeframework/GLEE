"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $20,000. However,  to give you a headstart, I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $18,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?  That's a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $13,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
