{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $10,000 is a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can potentially increase the price slightly. 

However, you should be prepared to lower the price if necessary to avoid losing the deal to John."
