Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's a good strategy to aim for a price closer to the middle ground between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a slightly higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That feels like a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my ideal price of $95. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for $80. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and a successful transaction."
