"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $950,000 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.

$900,000 is a good price. It's a compromise that's still significantly lower than John's price, and it avoids further negotiation."
