"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
