"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the product's potential will far exceed your initial outlay. Let me know your thoughts!",1600000.0,Alice,1,
