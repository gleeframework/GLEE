"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,700,000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still being a worthwhile investment for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
