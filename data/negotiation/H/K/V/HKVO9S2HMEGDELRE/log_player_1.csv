Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (since it's less than his perceived value) while still securing a significant profit for yourself.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
