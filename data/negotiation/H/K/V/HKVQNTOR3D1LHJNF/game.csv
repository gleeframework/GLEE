"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for my budget.  I'd be willing to offer $5,000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,500 is far too low for a product of this caliber. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your final offer. I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget for this purchase. My absolute maximum is $7,500.  If that works, we have a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
