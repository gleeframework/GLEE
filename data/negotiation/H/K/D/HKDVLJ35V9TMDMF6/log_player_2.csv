``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high for Bob's budget. While it's better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum limit.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,350,000 represents a fair reflection of this product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There is a good chance Alice will go lower if she wants to make the deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget.  While there's a chance she might lower the price further, Bob doesn't want to risk it.  John is offering the product at a price that is within Bob's budget, so it's the safest and most cost-effective option."
