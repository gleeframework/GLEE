Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
