"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really benefit from it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being reasonable for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
