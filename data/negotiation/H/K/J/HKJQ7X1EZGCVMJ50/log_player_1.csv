Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product is also worth $1,500,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable price, given that he valued the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,550,000 is a good deal, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
