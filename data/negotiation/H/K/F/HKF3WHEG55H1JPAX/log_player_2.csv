You're still above your target price of $8,000. Let's see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price."

Alice is at $10,000, which is still above your target of $8,000.  While you could counteroffer again, it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase from John for $8,000 and secure the product within your budget."
