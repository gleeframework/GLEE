"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll get a valuable product at a good price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd be willing to go up to $900,000. That's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",925000.0,Alice,5,
