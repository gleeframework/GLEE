Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really useful for you. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $130, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This allows for some negotiation space.
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and inviting. I've also highlighted the product's value to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to make an offer. 

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point for negotiation. By offering a lower price than my minimum, I'm opening the door for a potential counteroffer from Bob. I'll then have the opportunity to either accept his offer or counter again, ultimately aiming to secure a price as close to $150 as possible. If the negotiation stalls or Bob is unwilling to budge, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a better price from Bob. I believe there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $115. This is halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Message:** I've kept the tone friendly and acknowledged Bob's offer. I've also emphasized the value of the product for him, and highlighted that $115 is a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I earn more than $100. By splitting the difference, I'm signaling flexibility and willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully, weighing the potential of reaching a higher price with Bob against the guaranteed $150 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is still lower than my ideal price, it's now only $40 below my minimum acceptable price.  Given that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired range, accepting his offer at $110 is the best strategy in this scenario. 

* **Reasoning:**  
    * **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, potentially leading to a stalemate or a lower price.
    * **Risk:** There's a risk that further negotiations could lead to Bob backing out entirely or refusing to budge on his price. 
    * **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and avoid the potential of losing out on both Bob and John. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $110 is the most sensible choice. It allows me to earn a decent profit while mitigating the risk of further negotiation."
