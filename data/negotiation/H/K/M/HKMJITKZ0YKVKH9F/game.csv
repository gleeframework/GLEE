"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $8,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to stay closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This would still be a great price for you and allows me to move closer to your desired budget. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
