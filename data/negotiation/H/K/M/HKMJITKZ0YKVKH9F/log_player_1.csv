{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $10,000 is higher than $8,000, making it worth his consideration.
* **It's below my minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition. 

This strategy allows me to start the negotiation strong while leaving room to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's value:** $8,500 is still higher than Bob's value of $8,000, making it potentially appealing to him.
* **Counteroffer is closer to my value:** $8,500 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, increasing my potential profit.
* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  The counteroffer presents a middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message is friendly and emphasizes value:** The message is polite and highlights the potential benefits for Bob. 

This approach aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome while staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $8,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to stay closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.

I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. This will allow me to test his willingness to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This would still be a great price for you and allows me to move closer to your desired budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is still above Bob's value:** $8,000 is higher than Bob's $7,000 offer, making it a potentially attractive compromise.
* **Counteroffer is closer to my value:** $8,000 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, allowing me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Counteroffer shows flexibility:** By offering $8,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Message is friendly and emphasizes value:** The message is polite and highlights the benefits for both parties, reiterating the competitive price for Bob.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that allows for a mutually agreeable outcome while ensuring I don't sacrifice too much of my desired profit."
