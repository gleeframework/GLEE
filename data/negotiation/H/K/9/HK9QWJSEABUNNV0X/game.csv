"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you mentioned, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to accommodate them. However, I would like to propose a compromise that respects both our positions. How about we set the price at $175? This still allows us to cover the costs and ensure a fair deal for both parties. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $150.  It's my maximum, and I'm ready to go with John if we can't reach an agreement.",150.0,Bob,4,
