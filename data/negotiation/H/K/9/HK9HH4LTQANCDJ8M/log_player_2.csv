"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer because you're able to get the product for $10,000, which is significantly less than your maximum budget of $15,000. There's no need to risk the possibility of a higher price with Alice or settling for the higher price from John."
