"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable for you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is considerably higher than that to me. I could come down to $11,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value to you, but I still think $11,500 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, which is a reasonable profit. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer or missing out on John's offer."
