"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
