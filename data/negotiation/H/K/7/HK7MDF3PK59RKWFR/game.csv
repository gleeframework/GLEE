"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the immense potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm not sure it's worth $950000 to me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and the potential I see in it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me given the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which reflects the potential we both see in this opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
