"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,000?  That's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me, though.  How about we settle at $10,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
