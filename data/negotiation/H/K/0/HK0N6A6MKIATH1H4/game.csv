"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can do a bit better than that, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $90. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to look at other options.",90.0,Bob,6,
