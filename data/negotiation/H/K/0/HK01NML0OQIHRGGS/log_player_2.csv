"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I think you'll find it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This price is fair given your value for it and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This price is still a significant discount from the original value of $1500000, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $850,000.** This is a significant discount from the original $1,500,000 value. 
* **Buying from John would cost $1,500,000.** 
* **Alice's offer represents a savings of $650,000.** 

While Bob might try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having to pay the full $1,500,000 to John outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a substantial saving and a valuable product."
