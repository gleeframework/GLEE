"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This price is fair given your value for it and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This price is still a significant discount from the original value of $1500000, and I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
