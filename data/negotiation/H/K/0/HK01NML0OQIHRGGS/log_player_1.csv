Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This price is fair given your value for it and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
