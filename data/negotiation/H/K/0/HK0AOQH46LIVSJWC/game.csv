"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $650,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still below my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $715,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",715000.0,Alice,5,
