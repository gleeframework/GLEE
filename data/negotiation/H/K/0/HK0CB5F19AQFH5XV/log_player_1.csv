Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start higher with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation or an immediate acceptance at a price above your minimum.
* **Not too high:**  While aiming for profit is good, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) is likely to lead to an immediate rejection from Bob without any counter-offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussing the price further if Bob shows interest but finds the initial price a bit high."
