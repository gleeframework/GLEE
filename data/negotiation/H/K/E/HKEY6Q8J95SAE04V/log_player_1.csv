Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. I believe this price is fair, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for $95.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still allowing me to make a good profit. I believe this is a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $90 is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'd rather sell to Bob for $90 than risk further negotiation or sell to John for $80."
