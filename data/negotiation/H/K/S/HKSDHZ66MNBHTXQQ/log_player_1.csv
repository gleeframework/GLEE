"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also confident that I can get a better price from Bob than John's $80 offer, as I don't know Bob's true valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be more appealing to him.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $85. While it's above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a higher price, even if it means going a few more rounds. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at this point.  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the fourth time Bob has offered $85, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale.  Even though it's only slightly higher than John's offer, I'm still getting a decent price, and it's better than risking no deal at all."
