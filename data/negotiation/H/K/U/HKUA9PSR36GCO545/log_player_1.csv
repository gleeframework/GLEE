Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is crucial:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing profit:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,300,000, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, still landing you a price higher than your alternative.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging your fallback option with John."
