"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep costs down. Can we try $950000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to buying the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet on a price, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980000 and $1075000, which is $1027500. That's my final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1027500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1027500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. How about we meet at $1080000?",1080000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it to the final round, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $1000000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
