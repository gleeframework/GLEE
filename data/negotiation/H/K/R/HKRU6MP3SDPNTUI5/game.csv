"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price still allows for a good return for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product can bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a little stretching it for me. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and see we're getting closer. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant benefit this product will bring to your business, and it's a compromise that allows us both to find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,5,
