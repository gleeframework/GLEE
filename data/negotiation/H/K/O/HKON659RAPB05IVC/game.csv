"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still looking to maximize the sale of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1500000. I'm offering you the product for $1350000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a slight adjustment, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to $1500000. I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
