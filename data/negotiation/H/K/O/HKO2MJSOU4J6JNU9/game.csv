"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial price is closer to reflecting its true potential.  Could we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
