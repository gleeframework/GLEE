Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $15000? This would allow me to reach my minimum while still giving you a good price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  Could we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try $14000. It's a compromise that gets us both closer to where we need to be.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $14,000 is still above your budget.  While it's closer, you're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. You've already shown your willingness to negotiate and have a clear limit at $10,000, so it's worth seeing if you can push Alice a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really eager to get this product, but $14,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
