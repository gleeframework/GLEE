{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and the ""exclusive opportunity,"" subtly justifying the high price. 

By offering the product at $1,400,000, you are:

* Aiming for the highest possible profit margin.
* Acknowledging Bob's higher perceived value. 
* Still ensuring you make a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
