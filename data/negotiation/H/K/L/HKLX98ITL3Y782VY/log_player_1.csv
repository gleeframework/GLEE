Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest and willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than John's offer, but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  I'm willing to go a bit lower but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant concession from my previous offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and it guarantees a good return. Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better price and could take more time."
