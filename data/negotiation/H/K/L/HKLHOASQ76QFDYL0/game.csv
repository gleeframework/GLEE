"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $13,000 is a bit below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This would still leave a decent margin for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
