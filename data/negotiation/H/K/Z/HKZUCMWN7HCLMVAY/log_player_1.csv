Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for a price of $1,490,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great worth."", 
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing at least $1,000,000. This allows you to aim high with Bob."
