"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
