"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm starting the negotiations at $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for concessions while keeping us well above our minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the $1,000,000 it's worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting the negotiations"" signals our willingness to engage in a back-and-forth discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our asking price and our minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer was expected, going as low as $700,000 indicates he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. We need to show him we're serious about a higher valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this price represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** We're coming down in price to demonstrate we're willing to negotiate. However, the decrease is relatively small, signaling we're still aiming for a price much closer to our initial offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:** We're reinforcing the idea that the product is worth a substantial amount, countering Bob's attempt to lowball us. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By saying ""a good deal for both of us,"" we're promoting a collaborative tone, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to find a price that works for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Stronger Position Unlikely:** While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely we'd see a significant jump beyond $800,000. Bob has consistently moved towards this figure.
* **Time Value and Certainty:**  Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation dragging on.  A bird in hand is worth two in the bush."
