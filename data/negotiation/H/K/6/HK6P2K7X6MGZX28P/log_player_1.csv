Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,250,000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,350,000 offer. Given that you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds with Bob."
