"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,250,000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  While $2,250,000 represents a fair value for this product considering its potential, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,625,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,625,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,250,000. How about we settle on $1,437,500?  This represents a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1437500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,437,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering we're both making concessions.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're nearing a deal. I'm willing to consider a final offer to demonstrate my commitment to making this work.  How about $1,375,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the concessions we've both made. Let's finalize this deal!",1350000.0,Bob,8,
