"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway. This still represents a fair value for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that benefits everyone.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet at $850,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your financial constraints. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be willing to close the deal. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,6,
