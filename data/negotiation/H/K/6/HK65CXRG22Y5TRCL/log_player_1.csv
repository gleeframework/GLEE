"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not going to give it away.  How about $16,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. That's the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $14,000 is still a little too low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,500? That's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still being reasonable for you."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer is a sure thing, and it's a good price considering my minimum."
