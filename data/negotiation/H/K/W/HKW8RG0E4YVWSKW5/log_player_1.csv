Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and going through the hassle of further negotiation."
