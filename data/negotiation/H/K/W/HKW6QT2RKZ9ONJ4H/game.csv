"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $850,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Can you consider this counteroffer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the best I can do. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
