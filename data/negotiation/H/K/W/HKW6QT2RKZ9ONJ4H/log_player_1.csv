This offer allows for some negotiation space while still securing a significant profit.  It's also a strong starting point to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $850,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Can you consider this counteroffer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my preferred price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. It's a risk, but I'm hoping we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the best I can do. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $882,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own financial constraints. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $882,500 is a better offer than before, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
