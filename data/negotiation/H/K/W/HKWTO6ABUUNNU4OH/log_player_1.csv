"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $825000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.  While $825,000 is better than selling to John, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $840,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 840000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $830000. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $830,000 is a good deal, especially considering we're only in round 4. It's a good compromise and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000."
