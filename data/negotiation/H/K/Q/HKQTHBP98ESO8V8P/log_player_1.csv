Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,000,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm willing to start high and see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, either by negotiating with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, and it's closer to my floor price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $800,000 is my floor price and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's a good deal and I'm happy to move forward with it."
