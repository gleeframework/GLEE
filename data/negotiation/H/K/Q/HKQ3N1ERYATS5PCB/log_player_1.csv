"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let's start the negotiation off strong."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price within $800,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired threshold. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I also have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not desperate to sell right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, aiming for a compromise that is beneficial for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While I'd like to push for more, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a profit and avoid having to sell to John at my minimum price."
