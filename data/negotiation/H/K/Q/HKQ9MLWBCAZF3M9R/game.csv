"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is too high. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product, which is closer to my maximum and hopefully a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not ready to sell the product at $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
