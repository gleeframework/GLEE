# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not ready to sell the product at $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within your budget and a good compromise. You could try to haggle further, but you risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $12,000.  It's a good deal considering your initial goal was to get it for $12,000, and you've successfully negotiated a lower price."
