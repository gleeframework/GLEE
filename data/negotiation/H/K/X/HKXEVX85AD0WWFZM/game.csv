"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget and what I've researched about similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you won't find elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a sufficient price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for what you'll be getting. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
