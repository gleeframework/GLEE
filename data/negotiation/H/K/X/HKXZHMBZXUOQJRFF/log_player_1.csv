Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""significant value"" and ""potential"" without explicitly stating what it is creates an air of intrigue and allows Bob to justify a higher price to himself. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests there's room for discussion, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than outright reject.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts the $1,250,000, you get the best possible price from him. 
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, still landing you above your minimum. 
3. **Maintain John as a backup:** If Bob rejects your offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
