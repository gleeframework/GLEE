"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a chance she values the product less than $1,200,000 and would be willing to accept a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer starts the negotiation process and might convince Alice to accept a lower price, especially if she has room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within Bob's budget."
