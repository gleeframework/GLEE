"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, considering your value and my maximum budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about $90?  It's a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$90 is still above Bob's desired price point. While it's closer to his maximum budget, he can still try to push for a lower price. There's no harm in seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
