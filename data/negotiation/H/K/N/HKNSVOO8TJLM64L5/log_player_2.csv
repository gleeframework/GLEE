{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
