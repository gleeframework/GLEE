After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's already a significant discount from its true value.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.
