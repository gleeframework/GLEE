"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price point is too high for me. I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,100,000 still exceeds my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  I feel this is a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $950,000 as my final offer. This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
