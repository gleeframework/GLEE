Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $950,000 as my final offer. This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $950,000. It's too risky to try and negotiate further, as it's possible to end up in a situation where you're forced to either overpay or lose the deal entirely. John offers a guaranteed price that's within your budget, making it the safer and more economical choice at this point."
