"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $600000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  I'm genuinely interested in acquiring your product, and I believe this offer reflects that.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $750000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of this unique asset. Let's split the difference and settle at $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
