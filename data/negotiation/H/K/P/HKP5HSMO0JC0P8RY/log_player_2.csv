Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $600,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my serious interest while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower offer to create a more favorable negotiation position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  I'm genuinely interested in acquiring your product, and I believe this offer reflects that."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. It's crucial to show a willingness to compromise, but also maintain my budget limitations. By demonstrating a genuine interest in the product, I hope to encourage Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $750000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of this unique asset. Let's split the difference and settle at $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is right at my budget limit. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of going over my limit or getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation.  John is offering the same price with no risk of further negotiations.  It's a win-win situation to buy from John and avoid further uncertainty."
