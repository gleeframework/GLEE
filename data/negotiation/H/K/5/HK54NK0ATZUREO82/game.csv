"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $900000 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable.  I'm prepared to offer $875000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my valuation and your previous offer.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
