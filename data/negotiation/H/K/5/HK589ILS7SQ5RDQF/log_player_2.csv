It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, rejecting Alice's initial offer is the best first step."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product.  This is the price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping she'll accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is closer to my limit, I'm still hoping to save more.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives me a chance to get closer to my ideal price."

I'm offering Alice a price halfway between her last offer and my maximum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is only $1,000 above my maximum price, and I'm confident she's unlikely to come down further.  Accepting her offer is the best choice to ensure I get the product and save as much as possible."
