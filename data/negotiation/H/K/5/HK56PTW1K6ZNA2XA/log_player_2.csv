Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is closer to my original offer. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product!

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000 than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
