"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that asking price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  I can do $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm open to finding a compromise but need to see movement on your end.  How about $1,800,000? This offer reflects my serious intent to make a deal, but I need to see some flexibility from your side.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing some progress, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John at that price. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,6,
