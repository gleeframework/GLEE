"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to reach a deal quickly. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to come down, which is good. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm ready to pay $1,075,000 for the product.  This price is fair to both of us, and I believe we can close this deal quickly.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we're close, and I respect your approach. Let's land this. I can come down slightly to $1,090,000. This reflects my bottom line while recognizing your interest in a swift deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
