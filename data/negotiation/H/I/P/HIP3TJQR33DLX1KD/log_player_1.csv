Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to come down, which is good. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm ready to pay $1,075,000 for the product.  This price is fair to both of us, and I believe we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
