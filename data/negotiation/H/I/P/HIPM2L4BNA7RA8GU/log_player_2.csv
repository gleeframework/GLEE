# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

  You can do better than $95,  it's worth $100 to you, and you can always buy from John.  Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

$90 is a good price for Bob, considering the product is worth $100 to him. While he could potentially negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than $90.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
