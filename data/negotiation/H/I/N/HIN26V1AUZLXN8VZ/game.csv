"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I can meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. It's a compromise that I think will work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we try $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob. Meeting us halfway between our previous offers is a good idea. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. It's a price that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my own needs. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1012500, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1012500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 again, but I'm also willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a complimentary service or a warranty that will add significant value to the product. I think this is a fair price considering the extras I'm offering. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but that's my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1020000.0,Bob,10,
