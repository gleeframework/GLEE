"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your original offer. I believe this is a good middle ground for us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and our previous offers. I believe this is a good middle ground for us both. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
