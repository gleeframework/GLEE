Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's budget, and he's already been through several rounds of negotiation. It's clear that Alice isn't willing to go lower, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on a product he's been trying to buy.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. It's within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
