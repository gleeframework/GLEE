Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,150,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing the chances of a successful sale.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000."
