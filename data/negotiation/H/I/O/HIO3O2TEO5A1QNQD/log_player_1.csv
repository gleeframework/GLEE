I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.  This offer is a starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping to make a deal while also maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price than my minimum, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
