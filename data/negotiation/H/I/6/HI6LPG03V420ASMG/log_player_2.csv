"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, so it's not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,500 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a significant drop, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a firm but reasonable offer to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still above Bob's target price. He has room to negotiate further and try to get closer to his ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. How about $13,000? I'm really interested in this product, but I'm working with a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price. The counteroffer of $13,000 shows a willingness to negotiate and is within a reasonable range. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without making a drastic jump that might alienate Alice."
