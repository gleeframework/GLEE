"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. My initial offer is $900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $650,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a little steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $700,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $775,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting us very close.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $725,000.  I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this number.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,7,
