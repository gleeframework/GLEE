"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and potential, and I'm confident you'll see it's worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in meeting halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and potential, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
