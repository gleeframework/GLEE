"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've already factored in some room for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't budge substantially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is making progress, but his offer is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  We're getting into the later rounds, so I need to push him closer to my acceptable range quickly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you steadily increasing your offer.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm coming down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it's only slightly above what John is offering me directly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply pressure. I'm making it clear this is my best offer and bringing John into the picture to emphasize that I have other options.  This puts the ball in Bob's court to either meet my price or risk losing the deal."
