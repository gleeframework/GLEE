"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've already factored in some room for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you steadily increasing your offer.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm coming down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it's only slightly above what John is offering me directly.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
