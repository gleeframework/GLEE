{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, $800,000 is quite a distance from what I can accept.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,350,000. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a significant gap from what I'm looking for.  This product offers unique advantages and I wouldn't be able to let it go for less than $1,700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
