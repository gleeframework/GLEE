Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He can also consider how much he values this particular product compared to the potential time and effort spent on further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, but recognizes that he may need to compromise a little. He's increasing his offer slightly, but keeping it within his budget. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than the price he could get from John.  Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price.  Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John to avoid further negotiation and save money."
