Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a high starting point, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation at a favorable price for me.  I'm also leaving room for some bargaining, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still not ideal.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,900,000.  This price still allows for a good profit for me, while giving you a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,850,000. This price gives you a great deal on a product that is truly valuable, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make a deal at this price, it's a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. While a deal with Bob at $1,700,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me a safe $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product."
