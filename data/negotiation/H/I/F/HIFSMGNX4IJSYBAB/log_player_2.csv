"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
 
Since Bob's maximum budget is $120, and John is selling the product for $120, it's best to buy from John immediately. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice since Bob's maximum budget is already met by John's offer."
