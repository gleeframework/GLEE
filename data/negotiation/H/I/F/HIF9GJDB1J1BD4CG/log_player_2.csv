"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is way above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for $1,000,000 from John. He has 10 rounds, so he can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is just too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,600,000 is lower than the first offer, it is still above his maximum budget and he can still get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, trying to get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  It's a significant compromise on my part, and it still represents a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,450,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000. He has several more rounds to negotiate, so he should continue trying to get a better deal.  There's a strong possibility that Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This represents a good compromise for both of us and I believe it's a fair price. Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still just below my minimum. How about we compromise at $1,400,000? It's a fair price considering the value to you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above his maximum budget.  He's reached a point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate are outweighed by the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the opportunity to purchase from John at a much better price.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's time to secure the best deal possible."
