"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,500,000 value within the 10 rounds. I'll be ready to counter his offers, and if things don't move in the right direction, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that low of a price just yet.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value, and I still have 8 rounds to work with.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is just too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I've still got several rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and continue to work towards a deal that benefits both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  It's a significant compromise on my part, and it still represents a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This represents a good compromise for both of us and I believe it's a fair price. Let's try to reach an agreement! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle.  I have four rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground that's more favorable for me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still just below my minimum. How about we compromise at $1,400,000? It's a fair price considering the value to you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
