"Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is just too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  It's a significant compromise on my part, and it still represents a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,
