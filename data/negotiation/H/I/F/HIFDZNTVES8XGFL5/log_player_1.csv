Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not excessively so. This allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still maximizing potential profit.  It also establishes a positive and open tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While I could accept and sell it, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,500 is low.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is very close to my desired price, and only $500 less than what I could sell it to John. It's likely that if I reject this offer, he might counter with something even lower, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option to maximize my profit."
