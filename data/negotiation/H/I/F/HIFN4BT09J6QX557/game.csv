"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  How about $10,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and this price is fair for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
