"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $8,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  How about $10,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 target. He's already demonstrated his interest, and Alice is showing flexibility."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and it's now only $2,000 above his target.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will harden her stance or Bob might lose the deal entirely.  At $13,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to buying from John, so accepting is the most sensible option."
