"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than selling to John, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  He's already demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium, so I'll counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a great deal. Let's split the difference -  $90. I'm confident you'll find this product invaluable, and this price is fair for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 is tempting, I'm still within range of potentially getting a better price.  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, so I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $89.  That's a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my target range.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 89} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $86? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $86 is close to my minimum price of $80, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  There's a good chance I could still get a better offer from Bob, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
