"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $900000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $875000. This would be a fair price that would allow both of us to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $885000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for $850000.  I believe this price point allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $880000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,7,
