"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm aiming to earn as much as possible, I also don't want to lose out on the guaranteed $150 from John. I'll counter with a lower price, but not too low, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about $140? I'm willing to work with you to make this happen. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still below my minimum price point of $150.  I will counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to my desired price. I'm still holding out hope that we can reach an agreement, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $130? This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll stick with my last offer of $120.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While $120 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum desired price point.  Since I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $150, it's in my best interest to take that option now.  It's a higher price than I could get from Bob, and it allows me to end the negotiation without any further risk."
