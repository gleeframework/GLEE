Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Backup option:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
