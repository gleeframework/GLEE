Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, you have another buyer (John) willing to pay your full asking price.  There's no need to negotiate further with Bob when you can secure the full $1,500,000 from John."
