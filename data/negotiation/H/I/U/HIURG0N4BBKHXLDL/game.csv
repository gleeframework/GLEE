"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still too far below what I need to accept.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would be a good compromise, and would still be a significant value for you.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This still allows me to save some money compared to your previous offers, while providing you with a reasonable return. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",950000.0,Bob,4,
