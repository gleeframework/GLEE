Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the potential value he'll gain.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price point gives me space to make further concessions if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Not too close to John's price:** I want to avoid getting too close to John's price, as this might make me less likely to consider counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for counteroffers:** I want to try to push Bob closer to my price. 
* **Not settling for less:** Selling to John would give me the full value of the product. While I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob, I'm not desperate to accept his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still too far below what I need to accept.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would be a good compromise, and would still be a significant value for you.  Let me know if this is something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm making a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,000,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm highlighting the potential value for Bob, reminding him it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This still allows me to save some money compared to your previous offers, while providing you with a reasonable return. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further concessions:**  I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price that I'm not comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed value:** Selling to John guarantees me the full value of the product. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take a lot of time, and I might not be able to get a significantly better offer.

It's a difficult decision, but given that Bob is still offering less than my minimum, selling to John seems like the most sensible option to maximize my profit and minimize risk."
