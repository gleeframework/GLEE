"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and see the potential in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000, as it's still below my minimum price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
