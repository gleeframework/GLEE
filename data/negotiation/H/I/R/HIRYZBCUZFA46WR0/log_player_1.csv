Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob while positioning the price as fair, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if needed."
