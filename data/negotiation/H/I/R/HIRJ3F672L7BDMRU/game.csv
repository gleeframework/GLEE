"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $11,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. It's a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
