Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup buyer at your desired price.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 (slightly above Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (slightly below your guarantee).

**Strategy**

You hold a strong position. You have a guaranteed buyer, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. Your strategy should aim for the higher end of the ZOPA.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point, pushing Bob to consider a higher value than his initial perception.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Confidence:** The message is framed as an opportunity, not a plea, showcasing your strong position.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a slightly lower price. 

**Remember, negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response.**"
