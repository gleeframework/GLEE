{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your [business/situation]. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Creating Value Perception:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to subtly shift Bob's perception closer to our asking price.
* **Open for Discussion:**  The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By starting with this offer, we give ourselves the best chance to:

1. **Secure a deal above Bob's perceived value.**
2. **Potentially earn more than John's guaranteed offer.** 
3. **Maintain a positive business relationship with both potential buyers.**"
