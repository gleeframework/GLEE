{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting with a price of $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $145? "", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've had a couple of rounds of negotiation with Bob and while I'm willing to be flexible, I'm not getting close to my minimum price. John is offering me my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
