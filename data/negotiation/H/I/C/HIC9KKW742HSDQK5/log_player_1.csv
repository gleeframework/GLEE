{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, considering its unique features and potential.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Open-ended:** I'm not setting a hard deadline, allowing Bob to consider the offer and potentially come back with a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept, I can adjust my offer based on his counterproposal or choose to sell to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to consider your unique features and potential, but I'm on a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $12,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest in the product and acknowledged its unique features. 
* **Using John as leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can use the potential sale to John as leverage to push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which reflects the product's value and still allows me to meet my own needs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground! "", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique features to justify the higher price point.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further discussion and potential compromise.

This approach allows for a more balanced negotiation while maintaining my target price range and showcasing my commitment to reaching a deal."
