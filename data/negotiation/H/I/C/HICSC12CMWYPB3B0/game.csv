"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $975,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'm offering a new price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
