"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident that the benefits you'll realize will far outweigh the cost.  Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation.  You know Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's a chance to get a better price. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price without immediately resorting to John's offer."
