"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's initial offer is already at $12,000. This leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **Time to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so there's time to explore different price points."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also trying to get a good deal.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $10,500 is still above Alice's value of $10,000, giving her some room to negotiate while also keeping the price within my budget. 
* **Setting the Tone:** This counteroffer establishes a clear negotiating stance and signals that I'm willing to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Opportunity to push further:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's still room to get a better deal.
* **Time is on my side:** I still have several rounds left, and I can afford to continue negotiating."

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are down to our last few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject Alice's offer, she might come back with a higher price or even break off negotiations. 
* **Good Deal Overall:**  While I would have preferred $10,500, $10,625 is still a good deal for me, especially since I can buy the product from John for $15,000."
