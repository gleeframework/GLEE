"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,000 is still a stretch for my budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering my limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'll make a new offer: $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
