"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good negotiating practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Target in Mind:** While we want to save as much as possible, we also want to increase our chances of getting the product for less than John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in my product.  $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would allow both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Alice has moved closer to our desired price, $105 is still more expensive than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to lower the price further. We'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price, and it would allow me to make the purchase."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:**  We're increasing our offer in smaller increments to show willingness while still aiming for a price lower than John's. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief, reasonable justification for the counteroffer can help move the negotiation forward.
* **Deadline Awareness:** We are getting closer to John's price, but we also need to be aware of the 10-round limit and the risk of Alice not accepting our offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair price for my product. Let's compromise at $102. It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is likely anchored close to the $100 mark. Further negotiation may yield little gain and risks exceeding John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Alice not budging further, forcing us to buy from John at the last minute anyway.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer is certain and saves us money compared to Alice's current price. 

While we might be able to squeeze a few more dollars off with Alice, the potential savings are minimal and not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
