Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's potential for profit above your minimum price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant portion of the potential profit ($100,000) on the table for Bob. This makes the offer very attractive to him.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While tempting, there's a risk Bob might perceive it as too greedy and walk away. The current offer balances profit maximization with a high likelihood of acceptance."
