Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Offering it at $119 gives Bob a small discount while still ensuring I maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for my minimum acceptable price ($120) gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell it below my valuation."
