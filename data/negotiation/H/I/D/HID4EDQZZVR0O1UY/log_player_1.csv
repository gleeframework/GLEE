Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $105. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That way, I feel like I'm getting a good deal, and you're still making a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $102.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100 and it's a good compromise. I'll accept his offer."
