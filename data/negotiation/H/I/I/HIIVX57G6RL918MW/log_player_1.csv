Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer gives me a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation with Bob. The offer is still below his perceived value, increasing the likelihood of him accepting.  However, if he rejects, I have a backup in John who is willing to pay my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer and leaves less profit margin. However, I'm still interested in negotiating further and potentially getting a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap and secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. This price allows me to make a significant profit, but it also shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still a significant profit for me and a fair price for both parties.  Negotiating further risks the chance of Bob backing out or me needing to accept John's lower offer.  It's time to close the deal."
