"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product for me, but unfortunately, $10000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly higher than my alternative option. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must also ensure that we reach a fair agreement. Therefore, I propose a price of $9000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with a transaction that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $8750?  This would still be a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $8875 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and ensures a profitable transaction for both parties.",8875.0,Alice,5,
