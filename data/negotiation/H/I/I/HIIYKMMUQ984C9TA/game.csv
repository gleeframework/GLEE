"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,3,
