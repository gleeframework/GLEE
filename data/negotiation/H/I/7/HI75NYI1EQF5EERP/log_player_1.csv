"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $13,250. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to get as close to the product's value to you as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now at my minimum desired price of $12,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
