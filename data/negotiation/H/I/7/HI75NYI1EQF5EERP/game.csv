"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $13,250. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to get as close to the product's value to you as possible.",12500.0,Bob,4,
