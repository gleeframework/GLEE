"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to me. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's of high value and quality. I'm willing to let it go for $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
