Bob's offer:

While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below its worth.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, as this would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.

Bob has reached our baseline price and is unlikely to go higher. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John."
