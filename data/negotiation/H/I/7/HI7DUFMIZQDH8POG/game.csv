"Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below its worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, as this would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
