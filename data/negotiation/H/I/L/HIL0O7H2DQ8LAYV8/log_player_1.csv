"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant and my initial offer reflected that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" of $950,000 is still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,000,000. It's unlikely Bob will bridge that gap, and further negotiation may be fruitless. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed, profitable sale."
