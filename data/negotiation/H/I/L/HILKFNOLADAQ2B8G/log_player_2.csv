"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've set the price at $11,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is higher than John's price of $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject this initial offer. You have more to potentially gain by seeing if she'll negotiate."
