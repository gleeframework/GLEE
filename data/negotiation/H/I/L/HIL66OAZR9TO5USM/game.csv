"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference – I'm willing to accept $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to get a good return. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $8,000 even? It's a win-win – you get a good price, and I get the product I need.",8000.0,Bob,6,
