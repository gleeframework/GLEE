"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $88.  Let's finalize this deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
