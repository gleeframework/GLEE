"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a little more than $120 to John, so there's a good chance we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is above my minimum value, I'm not satisfied with that price. I believe Bob will pay more, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob hasn't budged from $130. I've already rejected his offer once, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. There's a chance he won't budge at all, and I'll end up selling to John for $120. Accepting $130 is the best option at this point."
