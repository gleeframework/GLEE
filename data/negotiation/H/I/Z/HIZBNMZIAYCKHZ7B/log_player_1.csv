Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" Alice subtly anchors the product's worth in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $200 offer leaves ample space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more natural negotiation flow.
 
It's a balancing act. While Alice wants to maximize profit, starting too high might discourage Bob from engaging in the negotiation at all.  This offer attempts to find that balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss. It's highly unlikely Bob is unaware the offer is drastically low. Alice should counter, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $60 is significantly below its value. I could consider $180. Would that work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's interest, fostering goodwill.
* **Firm but Fair:**  She states $60 is too low but doesn't completely dismiss the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $20 reduction from the initial offer signals a willingness to negotiate. 
* **High Target:**  The $180 counteroffer keeps the price well above Alice's minimum while still leaving some wiggle room. 
 
This response aims to gently steer the negotiation toward a price that's acceptable to Alice while encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to Alice's minimum price, but it's still a significant difference. By rejecting and countering again, Alice can:

* **Test Bob's Resolve:** See how committed Bob is to this price point.
* **Potentially Meet in the Middle:** Aim for a price closer to $135-$150.
* **Maintain the Option to Sell to John:** If Bob is unwilling to budge significantly, Alice can still fall back on her guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one and settle on $150?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer positions the compromise as a fair solution for both parties. 
* **Firm but Polite:** The language remains respectful and collaborative, acknowledging Bob's efforts while clearly stating Alice's bottom line.
* **No Further Concessions:** This counteroffer brings the price to Alice's absolute minimum acceptable amount. 
 
This approach aims to finalize the deal at a price that works for Alice while avoiding a stalemate. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will likely be better off selling to John for the guaranteed $150."
