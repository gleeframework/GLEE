{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's lower than my minimum, but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if Bob rejects my initial offer.  It also sets a clear expectation that I am serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9250 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is still too low for me.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm worried that we'll get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it's time to take the sure thing."
