,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle again.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I still need to see a bit more movement on your side. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal and close this sale.",1050000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can meet you at $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 7. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
