Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be of great value to you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Strong Initial Stance:**  By stating you are ""confident"" in the price, you project a sense that the product is worth this amount and you're not desperate to sell.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The significant gap between your asking price and Bob's perceived value leaves ample space for a negotiation that could still land you well above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  How Bob responds will be critical. If his counteroffer is too low, you might need to come down significantly or consider John's offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The prompt doesn't mention if there's a time limit. If there is, it might influence how much you're willing to concede to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's higher than his initial perceived value, accepting now would mean a substantial loss for you. 

It's strategically better to:

1. **Show you're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.** Rejecting his offer demonstrates you have a firm understanding of the product's value.
2. **Counter with a price closer to your desired range.**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows you to gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this product utilized by someone who recognizes its potential."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant, But Not Drastic, Reduction:**  Dropping the price by $300,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but keeps the offer well above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reiterating the product's ""true value"" and ""potential"" reinforces its worth in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By stating ""this offer stands,"" you subtly imply that it might not be on the table indefinitely, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk:

* **Bob Might Walk:** He's consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest.  However,  there's no guarantee he'll go higher, and he might perceive further negotiation as greedy.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** You can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum price. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting $1,400,000 strikes a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with a motivated buyer."
