,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $11,000?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That seems like a fair price considering the value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  Let's try $11,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $11,750?  That's only $250 more than your last offer and still a great value for you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
