"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can drop to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stay at $850,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. I've tried to meet you halfway, but I need to be upfront â€“ I won't go below $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I want to make this happen. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,6,
