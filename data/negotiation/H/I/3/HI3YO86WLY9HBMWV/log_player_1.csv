Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement."",
