Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can see how much he's willing to offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm  lowering my price slightly but still aiming for a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a more reasonable offer and is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob has increased his offer, and although it's not the ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and further negotiation might not get a significantly better result."
