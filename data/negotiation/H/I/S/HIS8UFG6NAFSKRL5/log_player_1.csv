Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the benefit to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm starting strong.

This initial offer positions me well to get a good price while leaving room to consider Bob's counteroffers or to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:**  Bob's offer is still $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, he's not yet willing to meet my minimum price.  There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but not by too much.
* **Highlighting Value (Again):** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm indicating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's current offer, keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is now only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be left with John's lower offer.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and I might not get a significantly better price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. It secures a sale close to my minimum price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation with uncertain results."
