Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, however, $14,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could be flexible and come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.
