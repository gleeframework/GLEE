"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $130, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $145? This gives you a good price, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's make this deal happen!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $145. How about $137.50? Can you consider that?",137.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal!",140.0,Alice,5,
