{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and $950,000 is significantly more than Alice's value of $800,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's a large gap between Alice's value and your maximum budget, making it worthwhile to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John, but it's more expensive."
