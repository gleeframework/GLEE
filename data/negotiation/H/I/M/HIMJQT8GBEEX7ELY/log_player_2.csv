"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $22,000 is far above his budget.  It's time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject the offer. $19,000 is still way too high for him. He's better off continuing to negotiate or buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  If you're not willing to budge, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}
