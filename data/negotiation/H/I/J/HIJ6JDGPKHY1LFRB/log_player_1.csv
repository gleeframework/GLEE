"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for a final price of $120, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm trying to be friendly and build rapport, which can help make Bob more receptive to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Room for negotiation:** Even though Bob is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate higher. 
* **Not selling to John yet:**  While John is a guaranteed sale, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can't go as low as $90, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price, but I'm still above my minimum.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly can help keep Bob engaged.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Time is ticking:** I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and the clock is ticking.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or the negotiations will stall. Selling to John is a guaranteed sale, but at a lower price. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable choice. I can still make a profit, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, I may not get a better one."
