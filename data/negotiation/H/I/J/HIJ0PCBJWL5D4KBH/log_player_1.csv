Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts at a price point that's significantly higher than John's offer, leaving room for negotiation. It also leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob, making it appealing.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still higher than what John would pay, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for profit. I'm going to counteroffer to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good price for Bob, giving him a decent profit, but it also brings the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
