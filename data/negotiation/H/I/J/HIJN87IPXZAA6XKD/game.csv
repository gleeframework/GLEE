"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle on $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, and $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80, which I think is a fair offer considering John is also selling it for that price.",80.0,Bob,6,
