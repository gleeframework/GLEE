"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance you can get it for closer to your target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $115 to $110. This is a fair compromise, and it's still within your budget.  While you'd prefer to pay less, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a higher price or ultimately going to John for $120.  Accepting this offer is the best way to get the product while staying within your budget."
