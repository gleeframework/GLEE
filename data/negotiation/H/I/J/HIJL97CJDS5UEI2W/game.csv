"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
