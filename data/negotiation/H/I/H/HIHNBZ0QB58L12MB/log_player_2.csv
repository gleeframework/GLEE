"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you, and allows me to earn a considerable amount.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Buying from Alice at $1,000,000 saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** Even at $1,000,000, Bob is getting the product for $200,000 less than his perceived value."
