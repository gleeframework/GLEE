"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if he's interested and potentially gauge his willingness to pay more. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm proposing a price that's closer to my desired value while still being within a reasonable range for Bob, considering his previous offer. I'm aiming to close the deal with a price closer to my target while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 at this point. I'll continue the negotiation and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good deal and allowing me to meet my minimum target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer, aiming to close the deal while still securing a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my offer. If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000. How about we try $9750?  It's a reasonable compromise, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though we're getting closer. I will continue to negotiate with Bob in the next round, but if he doesn't meet my minimum price, I will consider selling to John in the following round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,900 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm still able to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

I'm offering a small concession to Bob, hoping to close the deal at a price that's close to my minimum target. I'm running out of rounds, so I'm making a final push to reach an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9900 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $9800. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you accept.  Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we are running out of time.  I've already made significant concessions, and there's no guarantee that we'll be able to reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
