You have three options:

You can do better than $14,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.

You're still closer to your goal of $12,000. Rejecting again gives you a chance to potentially negotiate even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product and the fact that I've already come down from my initial price, I'm willing to accept $13,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.

Alice is offering $13,750. Although it's lower than her initial price, it's still more than what you want to pay. You can get the product from John for $12,000, which is within your budget and a better deal."
