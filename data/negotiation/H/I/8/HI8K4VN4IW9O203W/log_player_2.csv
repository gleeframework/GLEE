"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows for a healthy profit margin.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000? This would still leave a significant profit margin for you, and it's closer to the value I've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
