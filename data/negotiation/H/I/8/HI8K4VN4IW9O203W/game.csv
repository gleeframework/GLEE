"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows for a healthy profit margin.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000? This would still leave a significant profit margin for you, and it's closer to the value I've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
