"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While $1,400,000 isn't a terrible price, you know John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000.  There's room for Alice to come down in price, so rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better deal."
