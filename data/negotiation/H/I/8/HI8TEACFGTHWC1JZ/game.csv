"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $16,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great product, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're firm on your price. $15,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Bob,6,
