``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate while ensuring I start with a good profit margin.  I'm also using a friendly and confident tone to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 
I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding firm on a price that is above my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing the discount to highlight the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $16,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.

```

I'm making my final offer at my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're firm on your price. $15,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```
