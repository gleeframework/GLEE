"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and start counter-offering to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $6,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also pushes for a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to continue to counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price. There's still time in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $16,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to move towards a price I'm comfortable with.  Offering $14,000 shows I'm serious about buying but still looking for a good deal. It also sets the stage for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great product, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to continue to negotiate, hoping to get her down to my desired price or at least a little closer.  There's still time left in the negotiation, and I don't want to rush into a decision that's not the best for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're firm on your price. $15,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price that works for me. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
