# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

While I could push for more, $990,000 is a strong offer and well above my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
