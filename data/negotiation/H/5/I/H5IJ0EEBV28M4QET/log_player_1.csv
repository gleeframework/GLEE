Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to make this offer particularly attractive to you, so I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, selling to Bob above $1,200,000 maximizes profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  We need to offer a price significantly lower than his valuation while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle for a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes value and an ""attractive offer,"" subtly implying this is a good deal for Bob."
