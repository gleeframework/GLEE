{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim slightly lower to entice Bob while still maximizing your profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a small discount while securing a near-maximum profit for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):**  While not included in this response, you could leave a small amount of room for negotiation (e.g., starting at $125) if you think Bob might be willing to bargain. However, this risks him rejecting the offer outright."
