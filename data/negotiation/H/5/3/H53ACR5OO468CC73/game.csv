"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little steep for me though. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that.  How about $110?  That's a significant step up from my last offer.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet with your offer.  How about $120?  It's the very lowest I can go and still make it worthwhile for me.  Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
