"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant amount, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a deal that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still very low.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale. It's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 than to risk losing the deal with him and getting stuck with a low price from Bob."
