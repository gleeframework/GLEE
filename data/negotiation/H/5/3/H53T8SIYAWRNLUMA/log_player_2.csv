"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to establish a lower starting point for negotiations.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down some, especially since she's already made a very high offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget.  I'm not ready to accept that price yet.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still firmly within my budget. I believe this is a reasonable offer that might get Alice closer to my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below my $800,000 limit.  I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still not willing to go above my budget.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to come down a bit more in the next round."
