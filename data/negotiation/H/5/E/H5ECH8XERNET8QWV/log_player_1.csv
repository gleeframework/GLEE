Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * Bob gets the product for $3,000 less than its value to him.
    * I make $1,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting higher leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially allowing me to still beat the $12,000 offer from John."
