"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500. Would that work for you?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
