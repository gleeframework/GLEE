"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it can be incredibly beneficial for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob, but still potentially within his range if he sees the value. It's important to make him feel like he's getting a good deal, even if it's not the absolute lowest price. I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low, even considering his valuation. I'm going to reject and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I understand you have your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product holds and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down a little further and offer the product to you for $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's a mutually beneficial price. While I could technically get $1,000,000 from John, there's no guarantee he'll be available in the future, and this deal gets me the money now.  It's a win-win!"
