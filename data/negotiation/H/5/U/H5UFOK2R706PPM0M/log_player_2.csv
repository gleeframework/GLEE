"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds significant value for us at $15,000. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection or business. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a special price of $14,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I look forward to hearing your response. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $14,000. While this is a discount from her initial statement, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially offer a lower price. Even if her next offer is only slightly lower, you'll save money compared to buying from John."
