"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$500,000 is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise, but still reflects the value of the product to me. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not going to accept it.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,500,000. This is my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about closing this deal.  If he still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not interested in paying a fair price for the product.  I've reached my minimum price, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
