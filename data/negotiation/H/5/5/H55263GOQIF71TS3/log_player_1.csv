"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $12,000 to Alice, and Bob is offering only $6,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a higher price.  Alice can still make a counteroffer, or if negotiations fail, sell the product to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,500 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. She has time to negotiate and can still get a better price. There's no need to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $7,500 is closer, but still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
