"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's asking for $130. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have room to save:** You're willing to pay up to $150, so you can potentially save money by negotiating. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, you can always get the product from John for $150. This provides a safety net and gives you leverage in the negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a reasonable price:**  A $110 offer is a significant step down from Alice's $130 price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  This counteroffer still gives Alice some margin to lower her price without losing too much.
* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone:** Using a friendly tone increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, as a compromise.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While $120 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You can still potentially negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John remains a viable option:** If the negotiations continue to stall, you can always buy from John for $150. This gives you leverage to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $115.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  A $115 offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $110 and Alice's offer of $120. This shows a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Expressing optimism:** The message conveys enthusiasm for closing the deal, which can help build a positive rapport.
* **Maintain leverage:** The counteroffer is still below your maximum price, so you retain the option to walk away if necessary."
