Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. Offering it at $11,500 aims to capture some of the difference between Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning listing it publicly, I subtly create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is my initial offer, I've left some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
