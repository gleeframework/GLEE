"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price. It also gives us room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I can adjust my price further in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still a good profit for me, and I'm worried that if I reject, we might get stuck in a stalemate.  I'll take the deal and move on."
