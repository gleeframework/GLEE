"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value. My starting price is $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to start by negotiating, especially since Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price. We don't know Alice's ideal price point, so there's potential to save money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  We're starting with a substantial drop from Alice's offer to show we're serious about negotiating.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and expresses our interest while also highlighting the price discrepancy. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $1,200,000 leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away the farm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1200000 is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our initial counteroffer, but we still have room to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows us to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's keep moving towards a deal. I'm ready to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** We're raising our offer slightly, showing we're serious about reaching an agreement but not giving in entirely. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The message highlights the price as ""fair"" to reinforce our position. 
* **Focus on Value:** We're still acknowledging the product's value while aiming for a price that's comfortable for us."
