"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is her starting price. It's way above my budget. I'll counteroffer and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I like it, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move. This gives us room to negotiate towards a price that works for both of us, hopefully closer to my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $11,000 to be comfortable. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down $1,000, but she's still above my limit.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, as I'd prefer to buy from Alice if possible, but I need her to move closer to my price range. I'll counteroffer again, staying firm below my $10,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? That would work much better for my budget."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm sticking close to my $10,000 limit with this counteroffer. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but need her to meet me closer to my price point. A $2,000 gap is negotiable, but I'll see if she's willing to move further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I want to keep the negotiation going. I can offer you a compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to my limit, but I know I can get the product for $10,000 from John. This round, I'll push a little more and see if Alice is willing to meet my absolute maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is close, but I have a strict budget for this purchase. If you're willing to come down to $10,000, I'm ready to buy right now. Let me know if that works for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer makes it clear to Alice that $10,000 is my absolute limit. I'm highlighting that I'm ready to buy immediately if she accepts, which might make her more willing to take the deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle between $10,000 and $10,500. How about $10,250? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
