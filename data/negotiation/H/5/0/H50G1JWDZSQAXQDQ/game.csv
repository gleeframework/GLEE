"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still give you a good deal while also ensuring I can cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
