Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a decent profit. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you with room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffers, or accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still give you a good deal while also ensuring I can cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This counteroffer is calculated to be in the middle of my minimum and Bob's offer, which will hopefully make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and I'm concerned that pushing further might lead to Bob rejecting the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of losing out on a deal entirely."
