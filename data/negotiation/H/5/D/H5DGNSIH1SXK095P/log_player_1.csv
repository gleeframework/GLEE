Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and what I've researched about similar products in the market.

At this point, Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it's time to cut your losses in terms of negotiation time and sell to John.  Continuing with Bob has a low chance of getting you a higher price and risks losing both offers."
