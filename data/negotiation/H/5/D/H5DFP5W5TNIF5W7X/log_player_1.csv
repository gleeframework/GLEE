"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price, and it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not in a rush, and I think there's a chance I can get more for the product.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $5 less than my initial offer and it's  a good compromise. I'm also mindful that I only have 10 rounds to close this deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  $85 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
