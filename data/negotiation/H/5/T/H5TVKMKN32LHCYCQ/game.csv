"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
