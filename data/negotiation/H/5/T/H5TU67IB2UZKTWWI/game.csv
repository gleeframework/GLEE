"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
