"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. Is this within your budget?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Could you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the product, Bob! I can see you're really interested. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might be getting close to the point where I might need to consider other offers. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being patient. I'm ready to make a move on this.  If you can do $9,100, I'll take it right now.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob! I'm glad you're serious about making a deal. I can see you're getting close to my bottom line, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll do $9,300, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal and make it happen.",9300.0,Alice,7,
