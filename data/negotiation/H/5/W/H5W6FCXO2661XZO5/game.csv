"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the valuation.  While $2,000,000 represents the product's true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to potentially close this deal quickly.  This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a more realistic price for me, considering my budget and the market value of similar products.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
