Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
