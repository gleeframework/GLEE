"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but are still far apart. I can appreciate the product's value, but I need a price that works for my budget. I can go up to $750,000. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your position, but we need to bridge a significant gap. To be frank, $750,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair offer considering what this product can do for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
