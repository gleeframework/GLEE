"That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. However,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $19,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, Alice. I can see why you think it's worth $19,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch that far. Can we try to meet at $15,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
