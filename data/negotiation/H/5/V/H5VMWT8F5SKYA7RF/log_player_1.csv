"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm leaving it open-ended to let Bob know that the price is negotiable, and I'm open to hearing his perspective. 

This strategy allows me to explore Bob's value for the product while leaving room for negotiation if needed. If Bob rejects, I'll have more information about his perceived value and can adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I think $80 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at that price.  My goal is to maximize my earnings, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer.  This allows me to:

* **Gain Information:** Understand if Bob is willing to move higher than $80.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Show that I have other options (like selling to John) and am not under pressure to accept his first offer.

In the next round, I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and propose a counteroffer that reflects my understanding of his value and my desire to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're showing interest.  I'm willing to go down a little, but $80 is just a bit too low for me right now. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a bit of profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Appreciation:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my appreciation for his interest, building a positive rapport. 
* **Compromise:**  I offer a compromise by dropping my price from $100 to $90.  This shows flexibility and signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justify the Price:**  I explain my reasoning for the price. This helps to frame the offer as fair and reasonable.  
* **Encourage Agreement:**  I use a direct question to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

This counteroffer is calculated to be a good balance between my desire to maximize my earnings and my willingness to be flexible. I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I've shown a willingness to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I want to see if he's truly willing to go higher. 

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to close the deal and that I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob might be willing to go higher than $85 to secure the product, especially if he feels like he's missing out.

In the next round, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that reflects the progress made so far."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $85 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $88? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a bit of profit. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm also aware of other potential buyers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Appreciation:**  I continue to acknowledge Bob's offers and maintain a positive tone to build rapport.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer but am still above my minimum acceptable price, showing a willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating my value for the product.
* **Introduce Limited Time:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, I subtly imply that I have other options, increasing pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Encourage Agreement:**  I directly ask for Bob's thoughts, encouraging him to respond and potentially accept my offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired profit and Bob's perceived value. I believe it's a strong offer that could lead to a successful negotiation in the remaining rounds."
