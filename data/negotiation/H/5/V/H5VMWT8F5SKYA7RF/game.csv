"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're showing interest.  I'm willing to go down a little, but $80 is just a bit too low for me right now. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a bit of profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $85 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $88? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a bit of profit. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm also aware of other potential buyers.  What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,
