"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value to us and is priced at $12,000. Considering its worth to you, I propose an offer of $10,000 for it. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a competitive deal. I believe this offer presents a mutually beneficial opportunity. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation.  You know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to go lower to make a sale.
* **Get a better deal:**  Even if you end up buying from John, you haven't lost anything by trying to get a better price from Alice."
