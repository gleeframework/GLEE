Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a higher price** than Bob's initial value.
* **Start the negotiation process** by offering a price that is likely to be countered. 
* **Maintain the option** to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better offer, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum.  

I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

* **Reinforce value:** I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not ready to settle for anything less. 

I'm confident that I can continue to negotiate with Bob and secure a better price.  Selling to John would guarantee me the highest price, but I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if I can get closer to my goal with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've thought about it, and I would like to propose $1,130,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, it's becoming increasingly clear that we are not going to reach an agreement.  His offers are still too low, and it's becoming a waste of time to continue negotiating.  

It's time to cut my losses and move on.  Selling to John will guarantee me my minimum acceptable price and allow me to move on to other opportunities."
