"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our unique and highly valuable product to you. Our product offers unparalleled benefits and capabilities that are worth far more than its actual cost. Given its intrinsic value and the potential it holds, I believe we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests.

I am offering the product to you at a special introductory price of $900,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth, making it an exceptional opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality asset at a fraction of its market value.

Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. I am confident that once you understand the full potential of the product, you will find this offer to be highly attractive.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

``` 

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum budget and the $1,000,000 John would charge. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
