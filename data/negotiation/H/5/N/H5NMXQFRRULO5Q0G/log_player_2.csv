"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product for $600,000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a great starting point for Bob. $600,000 is a good price, but Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to offer the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to earn a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $550,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further by continuing to counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be a less favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $550,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $525,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 525000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go as low as $525,000. We're willing to make a small concession, but we need to earn a reasonable profit. We're willing to offer the product for $540,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $540,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $540,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, and Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance Bob can still get the price down further. Buying from John at this point would be a less favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $540,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $535,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 535000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go as low as $535,000. We're willing to make a small adjustment, but we need to earn a reasonable profit. We're willing to offer the product for $545,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $545,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $545,000 is a bit closer to Bob's target, it's still not the best deal possible.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  There are still rounds left, and buying from John at this point would be a less favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $540,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 540000}
