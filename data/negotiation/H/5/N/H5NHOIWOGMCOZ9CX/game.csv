"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
