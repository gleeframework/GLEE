"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. Can you consider this?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth a bit more.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects its value and gives you a solid return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,012,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $990,000? This is my final offer.",990000.0,Bob,6,
