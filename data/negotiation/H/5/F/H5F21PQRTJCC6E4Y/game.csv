,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it shows my commitment to making this deal work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us and would close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
