Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $14000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $14,000 is still too low for me, especially considering I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? It's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway at $14250. This seems like a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally prefer a higher price, $14,250 is a significant improvement from his initial offer and is closer to my desired price. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing a sale entirely."
