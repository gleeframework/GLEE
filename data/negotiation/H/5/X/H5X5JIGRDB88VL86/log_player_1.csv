{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($115 - $120 = $5) while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $100. If he rejects, I can counteroffer closer to $120. If he continues to reject, I can always fall back on John's $120 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  That would be a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still below my minimum price. Would you be willing to go up to $110? That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $108.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only slightly lower than my minimum value of $120. This is still a profitable deal for me, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a further reduction in price, potentially leading to a deal that's below my minimum. Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
