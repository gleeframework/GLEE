"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  That would be a good price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still below my minimum price. Would you be willing to go up to $110? That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $108.  Let's make this happen!",108.0,Bob,4,
