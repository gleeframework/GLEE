"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $1,500,000. Considering its high worth to you, we propose an initial offer of $1,200,000. We believe this price reflects the product's true value while providing a fair deal for both parties. Please let us know if you would like to discuss further or proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While it's disappointing to hear that $1,200,000 was too high, I understand the dynamics of negotiation. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to meet you halfway. Our revised offer is $1,075,000. This price reflects the product's value to both parties and provides a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal $950,000. There's still a good chance Alice will want to reach an agreement and might be willing to compromise further."

Let's aim for a deal that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet at $1,000,000. To ensure a fair deal for both parties, I am proposing a final offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value to you while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful transaction.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,050,000 is relatively close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000. It's a reasonable compromise and a significantly better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance that further negotiation could bring the price down a bit more, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of time with John increases.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price."
