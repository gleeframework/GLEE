"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's minimum value.  Offering $850,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious intent to purchase while also attempting to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but closer to his initial offer.  Since Bob already made a counteroffer, rejecting again and making another counteroffer is a reasonable strategy. There is still a chance of getting a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise that leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is favorable to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal.  It is more efficient for Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiations."
