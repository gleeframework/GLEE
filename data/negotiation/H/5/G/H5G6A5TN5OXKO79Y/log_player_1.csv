"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations.  Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm aiming for a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, we'll see what counteroffer he makes.  If it's too low, I'll have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's less than half of what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a good profit.  $175 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above the product's value to me. I think this might be a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a profitable deal for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $160. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's still above my minimum and could be appealing to Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer, it's still not a great deal for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $140. This is getting very close to my minimum, but I still think there's room for negotiation. If Bob rejects again, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John.  I'm not sure how much more room Bob has to offer, but I'll see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. With only two rounds left, the risk of not finding a better deal is too high. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is a safe and profitable deal."
