"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $8,200 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $7,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $7,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
