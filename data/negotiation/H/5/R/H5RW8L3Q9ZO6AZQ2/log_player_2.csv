Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $7,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
