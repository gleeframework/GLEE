# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing yours. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This represents a significant discount from my original offer and is a very fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $1,100,000, which is within Bob's budget. While there's still potential to negotiate further, accepting the offer saves Bob time and ensures a deal. At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal with Alice and having to settle with John at a higher price."
