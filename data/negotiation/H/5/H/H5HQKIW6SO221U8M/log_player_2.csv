Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,075,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference - $1,087,500. This reflects my desire to close this deal while recognizing the value you see in this product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,087,500, which is a better deal than John's $1,200,000. While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing with each round.  Accepting the offer is the safest option to secure the product at a good price within my budget."
