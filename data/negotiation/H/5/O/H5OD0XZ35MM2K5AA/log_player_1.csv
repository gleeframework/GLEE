Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still unable to go that low.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to see if we can get closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  However, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  My last offer is $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to make a final compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are stuck.  His offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
