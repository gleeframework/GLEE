Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,000,000 is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:**  This allows for more room to negotiate downwards and still potentially get a better price than selling to John.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive relationship with Bob increases the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I have a ""Plan B"" with John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for improvement.  I'm not in a rush to sell and can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** I'm not yet satisfied with the price.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my target by counter-offering.
* **Focus on value:**  In the next round, I will emphasize the value of the product to Bob to justify a higher price.
* **Using John as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a strong negotiating position.  This knowledge will help me to potentially push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Consider the significant value this product holds for you - it could potentially generate even more revenue than you initially anticipated.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate the value proposition for him. I frame my offer as a compromise, making it more appealing. 
* **Price:** $975,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still allows for a decent profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential for generating revenue for Bob, making him more likely to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** Showing willingness to meet halfway can encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value-based argument:**  Appealing to Bob's potential gains from the product increases his incentive to pay more.
* **Setting a clear deadline:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I want to make sure this round doesn't drag on indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed the situation again and am willing to go up to $960,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's final offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price, but I am not willing to risk further negotiation. There's a chance I might not be able to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer represents a secure and significant profit for me.
* **Time constraint:**  I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal with John.
* **Potential for better offers:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not completely ruling out the possibility of finding another buyer in the future who might be willing to pay even more."
