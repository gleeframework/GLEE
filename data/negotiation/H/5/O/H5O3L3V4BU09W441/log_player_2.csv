Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Consider the significant value this product holds for you - it could potentially generate even more revenue than you initially anticipated.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?
