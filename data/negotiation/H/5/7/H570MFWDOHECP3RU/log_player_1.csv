Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $115. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob provides leverage.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed sale at $100 means any price above that is profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it for $115 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer."
