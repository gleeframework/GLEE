"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate!  Alice's starting price is too high. We know we can get it for $80 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming for a price well below Alice's offer and even below our fallback price with John.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** We express gratitude for the offer but clearly state it's not acceptable. 
* **Justification (Optional):** We could add a reason for our low offer (e.g., ""I've seen similar products in this price range"").  In this case, we'll see how Alice responds first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90? That's still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down significantly from $120 to $90.  This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** $90 is still higher than our goal and our backup option with John.
* **Strategic Counter:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a better price. We'll try to meet her closer to the middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've significantly increased our offer from $60 to $75, showing Alice we're willing to compromise.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** This price is just below Alice's current offer and above our ideal price, giving us some bargaining room.
* **Justification:**  By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" we provide a clear and reasonable justification for our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to continuing the discussion.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is only slightly above our ideal price and well below Alice's original offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Sometimes, a good deal is worth taking without dragging out the negotiation."
