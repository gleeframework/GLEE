Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $180. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself.  I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is better than John's offer of $150. While I would prefer my initial price of $180, accepting $160 is a good deal and ensures I make a profit."
