"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm thinking of a price around $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds and knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, giving him room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** Bob wants to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal. Offering $9,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair Compromise:**  This price is still above Alice's $8,000 value, suggesting a willingness to compromise. 
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court, giving her a chance to respond and potentially lead to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I can't go below $10,500 given the product's worth. It's a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a strong position. Alice has dropped her price to $10,500, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. He has 7 rounds left and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Let's split the difference and try $10,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a great product at a good price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Committed to Negotiation:**  Bob demonstrates persistence by continuing to negotiate.
* **Fair Split:**  Offering $10,000 shows willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  
* **Appealing to Logic:** Bob highlights the mutual benefit of this price, suggesting a win-win situation."
