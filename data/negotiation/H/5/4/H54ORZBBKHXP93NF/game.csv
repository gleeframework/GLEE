,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While I value your business, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $10,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price given its current condition and market value. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
