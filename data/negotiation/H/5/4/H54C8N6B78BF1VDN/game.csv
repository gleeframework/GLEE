,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to that price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $95?  I'm really hoping we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $100.  I'm really hoping we can strike a deal on this.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there at $100, Bob. But I'm willing to get close. How about $108?",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $102?  I really want to work with you on this, but that's the highest I can go.",102.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $106, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",106.0,Alice,9,
