"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for a price that's fair to both of us.  It's a valuable item, and I believe you'd find it very useful.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - it's more than I'd get from another buyer, and it's still a significant saving for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
