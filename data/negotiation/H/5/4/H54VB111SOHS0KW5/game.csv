"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the value and potential of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows for a substantial profit margin for you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
