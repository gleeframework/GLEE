,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $11,000 for this to be worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which would be $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to give you one final compromise. Let's settle at $10,250.  It's a fair price for both of us and it avoids further negotiation.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
