Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can offer you a fair price of $950,000. This would allow me to acquire the product while also saving some money.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $970,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 970000}

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. $965,000 is too low, but I'm not willing to risk going too much further down to potentially lose the deal.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little bit more in the next round."

I'm going to sell to John.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on too long, and I'm not confident I'll get a price I'm happy with.  I'm better off selling to John at a guaranteed $1,200,000."
