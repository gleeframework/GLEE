"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's work together to find a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000,  which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
