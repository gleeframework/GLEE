"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's work together to find a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but still allows for potential negotiation. It signals Bob's seriousness about buying the product while establishing a lower starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Although it's a better offer than her initial one, it's still not acceptable.  There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000,  which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to Alice's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It also remains within his budget and provides room for further negotiation."
