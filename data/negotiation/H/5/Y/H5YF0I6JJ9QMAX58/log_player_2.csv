"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $140 for it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $140. 
* While this is a good deal, it's still more than you want to spend.
* You can get the product from John for $150, which is your limit.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with her or buy from John, which gives you more options."
