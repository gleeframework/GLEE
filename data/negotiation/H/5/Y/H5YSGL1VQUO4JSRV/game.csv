"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
