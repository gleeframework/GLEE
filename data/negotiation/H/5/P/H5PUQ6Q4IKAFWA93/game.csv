"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $9,000 on it. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $7,500? I'm looking to stay within my budget while still acquiring the item.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $8,000 would be the most reasonable price for both of us. This aligns better with my budget while allowing you to maintain a good profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,4,
