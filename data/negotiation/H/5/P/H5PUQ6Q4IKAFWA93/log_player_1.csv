Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $9,000 on it. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $7,500? I'm looking to stay within my budget while still acquiring the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

This aligns better with my budget while allowing you to maintain a good profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable.
