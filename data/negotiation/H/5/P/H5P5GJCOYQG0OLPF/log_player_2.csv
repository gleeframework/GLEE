"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I believe it holds similar value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price point. You know you can buy the same product from John for the same price. This means you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to consider other options or potentially negotiate with Alice further."
