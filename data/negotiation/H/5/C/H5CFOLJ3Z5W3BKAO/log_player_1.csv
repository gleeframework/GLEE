"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception of value. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer, significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, helps you understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His response will be telling. 
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, you have the security of John's offer. This allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still significantly higher. Rejecting now allows us to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** We still have plenty of rounds to work with and gauge Bob's flexibility.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting immediately might signal we're willing to go even lower. 
* **John Remains an Option:**  We haven't lost our backup plan and can still walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming back with an offer, Bob.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in price, but not drastically. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also holding firm on the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This tactic often feels fair to both parties, even though it's still above our minimum. 
* **Continuing the Dialogue:** The message keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to respond with his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,800,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit our absolute minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a significant risk:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has stated this is his ""highest"" offer. Pushing further could lead to him walking away.
* **Time Cost:**  Continuing with Bob means potentially missing out on other buyers, and we only have a limited number of rounds.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers the same price with no risk of further negotiation or potential failure to reach an agreement. 

It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed sale with John at this point."
