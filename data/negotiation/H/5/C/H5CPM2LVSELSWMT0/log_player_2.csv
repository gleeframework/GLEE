"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer is still comfortably below my $1,000,000 maximum, giving me bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** While Alice moved closer to my price, she's still significantly above my target. I want to see if I can get her closer to $1,000,000 before accepting or going with John.
* **Leverage:**  I still have the option to buy from John, giving me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about a lower price and not just going to accept the first compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be completely transparent, my budget for this is closer to $900,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we can close this deal today."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:** I'm being upfront about my budget target to encourage Alice to be more realistic.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""closing the deal today,"" I'm subtly implying that time is a factor, which could prompt Alice to be more flexible.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've increased my offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but it's still significantly below her last offer, keeping the pressure on her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so let's aim for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still $50,000 above my alternative option with John. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small discount isn't worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the time it might take.
* **Secure the Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs, so it makes sense to secure the product now."
