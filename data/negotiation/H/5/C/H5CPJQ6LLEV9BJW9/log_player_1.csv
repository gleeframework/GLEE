Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its actual value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this worth my while. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,750. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. Let's work together to find a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
