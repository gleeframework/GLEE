Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000. Aiming high initially allows us to potentially capture a larger portion of the value difference.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,250,000  leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message frames the offer as valuable and exclusive, subtly reinforcing the justification for the high price."
