"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,7,
