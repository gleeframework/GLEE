"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? This gives us both some room to compromise. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell your product and me to acquire it at a reasonable cost.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
