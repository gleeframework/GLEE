"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  This product is really top-notch, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit.",150.0,Bob,4,
