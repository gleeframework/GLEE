Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. We need to offer a price that's appealing to him while still exceeding his valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only what he values the product at. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The presence of John provides a strong fallback position and leverage in the negotiation."
