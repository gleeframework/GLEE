"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8200?",8200.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8500?  This is a fair compromise considering your value and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8700, but I think I can do better than that. I'm going to take a small step back to $8650. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",8650.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8650 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8400, which is a significant compromise for me. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm confident we can make this deal work.",8400.0,Bob,8,
