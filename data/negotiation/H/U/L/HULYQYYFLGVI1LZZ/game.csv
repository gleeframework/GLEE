"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but my budget allows for something closer to $1,000,000. Would that be feasible?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still fitting within a comfortable range for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could stretch to $1,300,000 if that works for you. This offer represents a serious investment on my part and I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand this is a significant decision for you. To meet you closer to your budget, I can come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest I can go while still reflecting the true worth of this product. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to offer $1,400,000 as my final offer. This is a very serious offer for me and I'm hoping we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
