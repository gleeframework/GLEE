"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and she is offering it for $1,100,000. This means she is still willing to sell for significantly more than her cost. We can likely get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still too high. Given my budget, I'm only able to consider a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll seriously consider it."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm going to counter with a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet.
