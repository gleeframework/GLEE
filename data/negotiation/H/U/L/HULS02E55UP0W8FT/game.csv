"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still too high. Given my budget, I'm only able to consider a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll seriously consider it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm going to counter with a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account the negotiations we've had so far.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit but $925,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $910,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer is within my budget and a good value for you as well.  Let's finalize this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with a price of $920,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",920000.0,Alice,7,
