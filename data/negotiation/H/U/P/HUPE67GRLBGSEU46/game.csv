"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer right now.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump for me.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,5,
