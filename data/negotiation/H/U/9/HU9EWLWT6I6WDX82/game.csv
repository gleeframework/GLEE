"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can do $16000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot. I can do $15000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I've already told John I'd sell it to him for this price, and I don't want to lose that opportunity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to sell it to John for $15000, but I'm still willing to make a serious offer. I can do $13000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,8,
