Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While we might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are getting smaller.  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy for under $1 million. Accepting at $925,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
