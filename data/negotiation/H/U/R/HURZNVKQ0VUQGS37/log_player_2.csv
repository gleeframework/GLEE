"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still well below my maximum price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to pay $1,300,000, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000, allowing Bob to save a considerable amount of money.  While there's always a chance to negotiate further, accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is both appealing and within Bob's budget.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would lead to a slightly better price, but it's also likely to take more time and effort.  Given the potential gains are not significant, it's more strategic for Bob to accept the offer and move forward."
