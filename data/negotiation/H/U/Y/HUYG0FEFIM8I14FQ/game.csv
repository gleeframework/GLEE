"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $150.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price. I'll offer it to you for $115. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $150.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price we can both agree on. How about $110? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already offered you $110 in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go back on that. I'll stick with my previous offer of $115. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",115.0,Alice,7,
