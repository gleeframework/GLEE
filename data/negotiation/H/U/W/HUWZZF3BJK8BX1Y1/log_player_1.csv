"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets a high starting point and allows for room to negotiate downwards.  I'm also leaving myself 9 more rounds to work with Bob and adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a good offer and closer to my minimum price, I'm going to reject it for now. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. I still have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so there's plenty of time to come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding out for a higher price. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm still confident I can secure a higher price than what John is offering, and I have 6 more rounds to work with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward and leaves room for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's now above my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,800,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John.  I have 4 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. It shows that I'm serious about closing a deal and willing to meet him halfway. This is my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John. I'm running out of time, but I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of time. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. It's also a significant improvement over what John is offering, so it's the best option at this point."
