"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $850000. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum, so I'm willing to meet you at $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860000. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",880000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $870000, but that's my absolute limit. If you can meet me at that price, I'll consider it.",870000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see that we're really close, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $870000. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, so I'm making a strong offer.
