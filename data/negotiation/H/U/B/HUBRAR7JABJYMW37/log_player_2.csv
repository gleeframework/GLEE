I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it for a limited time. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's not unrealistic.

* **John is a Solid Backup:**  You have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, giving you a strong fallback position.

```

**Reasoning:**
