# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000)** is less than what you would pay John ($1,200,000).
* **You want to save money** and Alice's offer allows you to do that. 
* Even though you value the product at $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer still results in a net gain for you."
