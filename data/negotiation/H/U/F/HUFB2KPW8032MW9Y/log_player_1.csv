Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to what I believe the product is worth to Bob, while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  I'm not going to jump straight to my minimum acceptable price, but I will also not sell for less than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
