Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $125 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly anchored around the $120-125 range. Accepting his offer at $125 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations potentially leading to no sale with Bob."
