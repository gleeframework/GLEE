"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than what you'd pay John, it's still a significant amount. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what Bob can afford and what Alice might be willing to accept.  This is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.  I believe this is a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,200,000.  While it's still a bit more than your desired price, it's much lower than what you'd pay John. Accepting this offer means you can save $450,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will not yield a substantially lower price, so it's worthwhile to accept this offer."
