Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  
* This offer allows me to explore Bob's interest and potentially reach a higher price.  
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider his counteroffer and possibly negotiate further. However, I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is more than my minimum price of $800,000, it's significantly lower than my desired price and leaves a large gap between our valuations.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.  I believe this is a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $1,050,000:** This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer. It shows flexibility but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to him, the fact that I'm willing to compromise, and suggesting this is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm trying to push Bob towards a higher price without completely closing the door on a deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider his counteroffer, but I also have the option to sell to John."
