Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $10,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's perception by mentioning listing it publicly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
