"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its potential value. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $800000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while also acknowledging your need for a reasonable return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $875000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs.  Let's close this deal and move forward together.",875000.0,Alice,5,
