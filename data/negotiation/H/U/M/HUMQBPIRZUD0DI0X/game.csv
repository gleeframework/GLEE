"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering its worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I still think there's some room for us to meet in the middle. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that meets you halfway.",800000.0,Alice,5,
