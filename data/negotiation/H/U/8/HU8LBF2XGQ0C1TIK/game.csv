"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is a fair price for this product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1012500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $1075000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some additional benefits, such as a 5-year warranty and priority support. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, and I'll throw in a 3-year warranty and priority support, just like in my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
