Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob a little room to negotiate will make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You're still leaving yourself room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is more than Bob's perceived value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm better off selling to John for $15,000, which ensures I meet my minimum price and get the best possible outcome."
