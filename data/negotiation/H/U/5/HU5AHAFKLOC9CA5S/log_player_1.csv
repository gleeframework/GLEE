Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving and generating significant revenue. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this price represents a fair deal given its potential. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still highly profitable for you. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the potential value to Bob's operations helps justify the high price, even if he only values it at $800,000 intrinsically. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, you would likely have multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers to reach an agreement."
