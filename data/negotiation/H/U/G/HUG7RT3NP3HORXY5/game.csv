"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $920,000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.  Time is running out, and I don't want to miss this opportunity.",975000.0,Alice,7,
