Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  I know he values the product, so there's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your price point,  I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $13,000?

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, this is a good deal for me. It's more than I'd get from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
