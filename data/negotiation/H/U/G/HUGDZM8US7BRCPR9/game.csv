"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's meet halfway!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal, as it's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
