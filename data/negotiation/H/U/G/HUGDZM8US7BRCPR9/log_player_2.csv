"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  There's no need to accept an offer that's worse than his backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the same product from John for less.  There's no need to accept an offer that's worse than his backup option.  Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal, as it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
