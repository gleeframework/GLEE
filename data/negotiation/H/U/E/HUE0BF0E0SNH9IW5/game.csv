"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1000000 for it to be a worthwhile investment for me. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is considerably lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident the product will deliver value beyond this price. How about we settle on $1250000? This would still give you a great return on investment, and it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $1100000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
