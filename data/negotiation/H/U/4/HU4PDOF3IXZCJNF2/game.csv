"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
