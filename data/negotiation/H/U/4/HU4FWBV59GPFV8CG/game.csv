"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a price that's still significantly below its true worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still too far below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value the product holds for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still significantly less than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product. I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1,025,000 is still not close to the value I place on this product. Let's try $1,050,000.

I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
