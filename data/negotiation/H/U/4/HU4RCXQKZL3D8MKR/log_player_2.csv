"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. It would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $815000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Alice has indicated that $815,000 is her absolute lowest price, and Bob has already reached his maximum limit. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price from Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the product for his maximum budget."
