"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do better than $8,500, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on a good deal. How about we stick with $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,5,
