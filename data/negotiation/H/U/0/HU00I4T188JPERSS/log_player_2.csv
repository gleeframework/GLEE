# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  He should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price, but if that fails, he has a guaranteed alternative with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the same product for $8,000 from John. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if he can get Alice closer to his target price."
