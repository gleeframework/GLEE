Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer.
* **Leaving the door open:**  By offering a price, I'm giving Bob the opportunity to respond, but I'm also establishing my baseline. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my earnings with the possibility of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:**  $120 is more than my minimum price of $100.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John for $100. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process. Accepting Bob's offer is a quick and straightforward solution."
