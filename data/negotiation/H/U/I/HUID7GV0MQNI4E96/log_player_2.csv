"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $800,000. However, I believe it holds even greater value for you, potentially reaching $1,200,000. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential for you, but also ensures a fair return for me. Please consider this offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000). 
* **Rejecting the offer would be worse:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he'll have to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is a higher price. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob as it allows him to get the product at a lower price than he would pay from John."
