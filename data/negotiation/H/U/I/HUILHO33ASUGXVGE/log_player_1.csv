Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, I'm confident this product is worth more given its unique features and market potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not able to meet your current price.  $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This is a significant amount and I believe it reflects the potential of the product, while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations or waiting for a potentially better offer from Bob. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 now is the best course of action."
