"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further."
