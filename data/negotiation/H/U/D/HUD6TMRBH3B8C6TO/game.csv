"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This would still allow you a healthy profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",10750.0,Alice,3,
