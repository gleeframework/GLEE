"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a significant profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and there's room to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $10,750, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to John's price of $15,000. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great."
