"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This would still allow you a healthy profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $9,500 is still a bit low for me, and I think there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
