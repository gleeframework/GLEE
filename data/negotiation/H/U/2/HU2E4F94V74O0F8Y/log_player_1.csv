Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (Bob's value - your minimum)

**Strategy**

The key is to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, while still maximizing your profit.  Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks him rejecting the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($150,000) while still giving you a substantial profit ($350,000 over your minimum). 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,300,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a good relationship with Bob is beneficial for potential future deals.
