"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below his maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns.  Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will continue to reject lower offers or that Bob will ultimately have to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option at this point."
