"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my limit. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round. There's still a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer, especially since he already showed some willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up in your offers, and I appreciate that.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  To make this work, I need to be at $13,500.  It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my goal, it seems like Bob is unwilling to go any higher. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000.  It's better to sell to John and secure my desired price than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with less."
