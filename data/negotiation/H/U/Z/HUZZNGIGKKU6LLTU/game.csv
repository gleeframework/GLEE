"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my limit. Can you meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're coming up in your offers, and I appreciate that.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  To make this work, I need to be at $13,500.  It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",13200.0,Bob,6,
