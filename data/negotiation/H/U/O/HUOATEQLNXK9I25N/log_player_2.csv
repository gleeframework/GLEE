Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's far less than what I'd be able to get from another buyer.  To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is fair given the product's potential and your interest in it.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
