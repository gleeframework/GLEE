"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  You can then counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your desired range."

I'm offering Alice $850,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. It's a fair starting point for negotiation, hopefully leading to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll counteroffer again to try and get a better deal."

I'm going to offer Alice $860,000.  This is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is close enough to my budget that it makes sense to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, there's a risk that she'll walk away or I'll run out of time and have to buy from John. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product and avoid any further risk."
