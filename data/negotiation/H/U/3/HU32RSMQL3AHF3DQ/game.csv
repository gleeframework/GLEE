"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $145? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is a good compromise.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we compromise at $152? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",152.0,Alice,5,
