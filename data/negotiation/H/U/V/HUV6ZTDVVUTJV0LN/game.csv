"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to realize some of the product's potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
