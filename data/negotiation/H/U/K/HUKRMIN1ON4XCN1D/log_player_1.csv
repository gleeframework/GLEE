Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's above my minimum value of $120, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm trying to build rapport and highlight the value of the product to Bob. 

I'm hoping this initial offer will spark Bob's interest and lead to a successful negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $120?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in risking a counteroffer and potentially getting a worse deal, especially since John is also willing to buy for $120.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and avoids unnecessary risk."
