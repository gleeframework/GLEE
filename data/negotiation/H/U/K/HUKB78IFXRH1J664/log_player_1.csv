Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a great price, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""fantastic"" and ""great price"" to make the offer appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I explicitly state that this is a ""great price"" but leave open the possibility of negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy allows me to start with a high price, but still maintain a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting his offer and negotiating further. The only potential outcome is a lower price for me.
* **Time is Money:**  By accepting, I secure a sale at the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't have to spend more time negotiating.

It's always good to be mindful of the time value of money. While a slightly higher price might be nice, a guaranteed sale at my minimum is a good outcome."
