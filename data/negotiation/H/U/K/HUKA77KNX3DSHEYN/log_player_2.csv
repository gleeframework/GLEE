"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $13,500 is better than $14,000, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to $12,500."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
