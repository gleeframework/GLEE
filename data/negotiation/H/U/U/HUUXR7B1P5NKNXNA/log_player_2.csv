"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! Would you like to purchase it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your $120 maximum, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice."
