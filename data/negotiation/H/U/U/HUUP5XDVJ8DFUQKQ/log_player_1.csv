Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob and I need to make a profit. If he rejects, I can always negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that right away. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum price, and I can still make a profit.  I'm willing to accept it rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
