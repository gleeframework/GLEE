"Bob, I understand you value the product at $1,200,000, but that's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This price still leaves me with a decent profit and is fair considering the value you'll gain from owning it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
