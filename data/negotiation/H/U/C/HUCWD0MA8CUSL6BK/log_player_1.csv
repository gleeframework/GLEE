Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($130) allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $80 (your guaranteed price).
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** This price gives Bob a ""discount"" ($20 off his valuation) while maximizing your potential profit. 
 
This strategy balances your desire for maximum profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
