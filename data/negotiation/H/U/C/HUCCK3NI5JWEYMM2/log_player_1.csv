Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""benefits"" to subtly anchor Bob's thinking to a higher price point. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows you to potentially negotiate down slightly and still secure a profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how much he might value the ""exclusive opportunity""), other approaches might be suitable."
