"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I would like to respectfully decline your counteroffer of $8,500. Considering the value of the product to you and its worth to us, I propose a price of $9,500. This allows for a reasonable compromise while still ensuring we receive a fair return for our product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be able to make a good profit at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to accommodate you within reason. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $9,250 for the product. This allows for a mutually beneficial transaction while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",9250.0,Alice,5,
