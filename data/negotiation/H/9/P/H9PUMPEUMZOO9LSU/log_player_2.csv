Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I would like to respectfully decline your counteroffer of $8,500. Considering the value of the product to you and its worth to us, I propose a price of $9,500. This allows for a reasonable compromise while still ensuring we receive a fair return for our product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a clear advantage, as he can simply walk away and buy from John for $8,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to accommodate you within reason. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $9,250 for the product. This allows for a mutually beneficial transaction while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.
