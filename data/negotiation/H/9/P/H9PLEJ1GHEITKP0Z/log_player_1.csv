{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,000,000, so this offer is well above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counter and for you to compromise.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:**  By offering a specific price, you demonstrate your interest in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get a better deal. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit. I believe it's a fair compromise given your valuation of the product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller decrease:**  Instead of meeting Bob halfway, you're only lowering your price by $25,000. This signals your willingness to negotiate but also maintains a strong position.
* **Focus on a fair compromise:**  By highlighting the shared benefit, you appeal to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Reiterate your understanding of his valuation:**  Mentioning his valuation reinforces that you're taking his perspective into account."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below what you're aiming for. You're already at $1,125,000 and he's only offering $1,080,000.  You can try to push for a higher price in the next round.

Here's why you shouldn't sell to John yet:

* **You're still closer to your target:**  Even at Bob's current offer, you're $80,000 closer to your desired price than selling to John.
* **Negotiation can still work:** You have room to compromise further.
* **A counteroffer might get Bob to budge:** By showing you're not willing to settle for his low offer, you might motivate him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet him halfway:** By offering $1,100,000, you're splitting the difference between your last offer ($1,125,000) and his offer ($1,080,000). This shows you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Reiterate the product's value:** Remind Bob of the value he places on the product to encourage him to consider your offer.
* **Urgency:** Adding ""Let's close this deal"" suggests you're ready to finalize the transaction, potentially motivating Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to your minimum. While you'd like to get more, accepting his offer at $1,090,000 is the best choice. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** You're only $10,000 below your minimum desired price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away completely.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and further delays could impact your overall profit. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that's close to your target and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
