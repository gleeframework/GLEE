Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from other buyers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This provides room for negotiation. 
* **Framing the message:** The message highlights the benefit to Bob of a good deal and the fact that I have other options, but I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Next steps:**  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel like I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential to reach a better deal:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, there's a chance I can get closer to that price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering at $10,000, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his valuation. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights that this price would still be a good deal for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Next steps:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider his next offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John. However, $10,000 is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
