"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:** While the price is high, mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value"" aims to frame the product as something highly desirable, justifying the initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob above that price is ideal. This initial offer leaves space to potentially negotiate down closer to John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, reflecting its inherent worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Moving down from the initial offer shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above John's Offer:** The new price keeps the negotiation focused on securing a deal more favorable than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's ""true potential"" aims to gently steer Bob away from just ""market value"" and towards its potential higher worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above John's standing offer of $1,000,000. 
* **""Final Offer"":** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting limited room for further negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  While we're only on round 4, accepting a strong offer now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down later and potentially settling for John's offer."
