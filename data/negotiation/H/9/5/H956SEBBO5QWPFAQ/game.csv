"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start the negotiations at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,5,
