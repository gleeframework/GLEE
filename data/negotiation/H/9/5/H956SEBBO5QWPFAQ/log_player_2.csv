Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start the negotiations at $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly higher than your absolute maximum.  She's stated this is her ""final compromise,"" making further negotiation unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is the most you're willing to spend."
