"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $14,000 is more than your desired price of $15,000. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** You have room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an option provides leverage.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. You can always revert to John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer is halfway between Alice's initial price and your maximum.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer. 
* **Attractive for Alice:** $13,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, as it's higher than her desired selling price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $13,500 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice is likely to stick to her price as it's still higher than her desired selling price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Pushing for a lower price risks Alice rejecting your offer, potentially leading to a deadlock or requiring a deal with John at a higher price.

This offer presents a good balance between saving money and avoiding unnecessary risk."
