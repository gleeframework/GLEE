Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a significant profit. It's also a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still not the best price I can get. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I still want to make a profit closer to my initial offer. $13,500 is a fair compromise that keeps the negotiation moving."
