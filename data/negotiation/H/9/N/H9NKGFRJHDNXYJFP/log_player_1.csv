Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  It makes sense to aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for higher profit."
