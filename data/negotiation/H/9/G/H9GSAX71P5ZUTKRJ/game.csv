"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good financial decision for me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking that $900000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a significant profit while also reflecting the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to make a more significant saving. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to invest in it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a significant saving, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1050000 is the minimum I can go. This is a compromise that balances our interests and reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
