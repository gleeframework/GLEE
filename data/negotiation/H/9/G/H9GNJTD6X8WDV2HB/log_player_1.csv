"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation. Taking John's guaranteed $1,000,000 is the best move at this point."
