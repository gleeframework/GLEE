"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 
While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He's willing to pay $800,000 and should continue negotiating to try and secure that price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still aiming for my initial offer of $800,000. It's the highest I can go, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $800,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $850,000 is a good offer and only $50,000 above Bob's max, it's still not the price he wants. Bob wants the product for $800,000, and there's still a chance he can negotiate that price down. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations going, and he still has a few rounds to try to close the deal at his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still committed to my offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'm ready to purchase the product from John for that price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
