"Alice, that initial price is quite high. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
