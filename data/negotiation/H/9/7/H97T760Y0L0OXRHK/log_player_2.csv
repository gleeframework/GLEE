Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a price very close to my asking price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to move forward soon.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

``` 
 
We're getting close, but it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower.  There's still room to negotiate before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being upfront.  I understand your position.  $12,500 is the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

We're in a tight spot now. Alice is signaling she has another buyer.  

* Offering $12,000 right away might work, but there's a chance she'll accept the $12,500 and we save a little.
* Going lower than $12,000 is risky since John is an option at that price. 
* We're aiming for the best possible price while still likely securing the deal."
