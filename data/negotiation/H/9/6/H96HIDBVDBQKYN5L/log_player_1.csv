Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead Bob to counter with an offer closer to your desired range.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While you know Bob values the product at $80, starting above that value creates the perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  The price is still lower than John's offer ($120 vs. $100), keeping you in a strong position. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you have room to negotiate down while still potentially getting a better deal than John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, you still have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested and willing to pay a reasonable price. By rejecting and countering, you aim to potentially secure a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price favorable to you.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $105 is a strong position. It's:
    *  Significantly above Bob's initial offer ($90)
    *  A reasonable step down from your previous offer ($120)
    *  Still a profit above John's guaranteed offer ($100)

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Bob to either accept a price closer to your desired range or reveal more about how much he's truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about we try $92? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While $92 isn't ideal, it's only $8 less than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counter-offer only increased by $2, indicating his willingness to pay might not go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiation takes time, and the potential gain from squeezing a few more dollars out of Bob might not outweigh the certainty of selling to John now. 

It's a strategic decision to accept a slightly lower offer to secure a sale rather than risk losing the deal altogether by pushing too hard."
