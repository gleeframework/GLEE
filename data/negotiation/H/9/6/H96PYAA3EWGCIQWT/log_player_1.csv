Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and I want to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you and a price I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $125 is more than his perceived value, it's far less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 150}
