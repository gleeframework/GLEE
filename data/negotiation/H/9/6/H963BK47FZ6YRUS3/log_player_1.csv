Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is my initial offer, I'm open to a slight negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100.  This knowledge empowers me to aim higher with Bob."
