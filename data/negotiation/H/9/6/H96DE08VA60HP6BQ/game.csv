"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  While I see the potential in your product, I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700000 is unfortunately too far below the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This reflects a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $700000.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
