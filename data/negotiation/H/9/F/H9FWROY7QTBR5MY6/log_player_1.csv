Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price of $1,750,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob might make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to engage in discussion and ask questions, signaling that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price than your guaranteed offer from John."
