"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do believe the product has value, the current price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product holds, I'm willing to meet you partway. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $900,000? This recognizes the inherent value of the product while hopefully addressing your budget considerations.",900000.0,Alice,5,
