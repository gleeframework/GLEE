While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the increments are getting smaller and it seems unlikely he'll reach a price that makes continuing negotiations worthwhile for me.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significant amount over Bob's current offer. It's time to move on to secure the guaranteed profit."
