Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves me with a healthy profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and encouraging tone in the message might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, which can lead to a better outcome for both of us.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum value, so I have a backup option if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to pay more than his initial value of $1,000,000, indicating some potential for a deal. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $1,100,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000. This shows good faith in the negotiation and demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal.
* **Clear Communication:**  My message is clear and straightforward, stating the new price and emphasizing the benefits for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum value but still falls short. Accepting it would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's increasing offers suggest that he's willing to pay more. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Having John as a buyer for $1,500,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations. I don't need to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to reach a middle ground while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're working towards a price that works for you.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000.

I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business, and I believe this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,200,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal.
