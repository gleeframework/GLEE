Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for more in the next round, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and there's a risk Bob will walk away if I counter again.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
