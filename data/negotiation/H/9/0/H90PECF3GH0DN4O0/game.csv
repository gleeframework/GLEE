"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your initial offer and the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference from our previous offers? I'd be willing to pay $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to meet you at $950,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be careful not to go too low. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000.
