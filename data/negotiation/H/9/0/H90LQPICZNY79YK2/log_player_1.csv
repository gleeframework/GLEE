Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to $8,000 leaves money on the table and might make Bob think the product's value is lower than it is."
