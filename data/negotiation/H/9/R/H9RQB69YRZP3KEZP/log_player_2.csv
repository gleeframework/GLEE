"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $102 is still within your budget and a good compromise considering you have only 7 rounds remaining.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky given the time constraint and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
