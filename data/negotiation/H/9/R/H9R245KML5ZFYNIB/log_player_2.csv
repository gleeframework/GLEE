"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer. He's offering $120, which is $20 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $130 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate further. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to drop her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. He's offering $125, which is halfway between his previous offer of $120 and Alice's latest offer of $130. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still willing to compromise."
