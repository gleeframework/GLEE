"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
