"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product I believe holds great value.  While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Even though she claims the product is worth more to her, you can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price. It's always best to stick to your budget and find the best deal possible."
