"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering your minimum and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
