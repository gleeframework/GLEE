Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. It's a strong compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a more agreeable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $1,250,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to secure that deal and save the extra $50,000."
