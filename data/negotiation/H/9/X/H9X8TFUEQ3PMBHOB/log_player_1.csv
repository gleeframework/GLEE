Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000). This allows for potential negotiation room and maximizes potential profit.
* **Unknown value to Bob:**  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, starting high gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  I can always fall back to selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net and ensures I don't lose out entirely. 

**Next Steps:**

I will closely observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum value, which means there's no profit for me.  I'm aiming to maximize my earnings.
* **Potential for higher offer:** While Bob's offer is low, his initial rejection suggests he sees some value in the product. There's a possibility he might be willing to go higher in a counteroffer.
* **Strategic negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and signal that I'm willing to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than my minimum value, but hopefully more appealing to Bob. I'll continue to assess his responses and decide whether to accept his offers or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and signal flexibility:** I'm lowering the price from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise.  This makes the offer more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for profit. 
* **Still above minimum:** The offer is significantly higher than my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a way to gauge Bob's real value for the product and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess my strategy and potentially make further concessions or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant profit:** Bob's offer is $100,000 higher than my minimum value, which represents a substantial profit for me. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  I've already made concessions and Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away or simply refuse to budge further. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit with minimal risk.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I've successfully negotiated a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
