Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if we present a strong case for the product's value. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** A high initial offer leaves space for negotiation.  If Bob counters, we can gradually decrease the price, still aiming to stay above our minimum of $15,000.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember that we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  This gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's crucial to assess Bob's personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
