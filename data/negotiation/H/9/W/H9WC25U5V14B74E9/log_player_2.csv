Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees the best price."
