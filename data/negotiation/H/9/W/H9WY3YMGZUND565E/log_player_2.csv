"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000.  This is above Bob's target price, so it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above the $800,000 limit. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $815,000 is still slightly above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Given that Bob has 5 rounds remaining and the risk of Alice continuing to negotiate higher, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees the product at the desired price and avoids further negotiation."
