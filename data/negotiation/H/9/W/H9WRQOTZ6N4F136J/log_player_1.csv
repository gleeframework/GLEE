Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me with a profit of $1,000. It's also a reasonable price for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000, leaving him room to make a profit if he decides to resell it. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still maintaining a decent profit margin. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I can potentially get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  This will allow me to see if he's willing to go higher or if he's set on that price. Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, giving him a slightly better price while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not high enough. I've already made two counteroffers and it seems unlikely that Bob will be willing to go higher. I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed buyer for $12,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
