"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $850,000?  This would still give you a healthy profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to get a fairer return on my investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
