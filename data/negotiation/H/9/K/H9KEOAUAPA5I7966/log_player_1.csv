Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and he might be willing to accept it, especially if he values the product at $8,000.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  $9,000 is closer to my desired price, so it's worth continuing the conversation and seeing if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm increasing Bob's offer by $2,000, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  $11,000 is still a decent value for Bob, and it leaves some room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **There's no clear indication that Bob will budge further.** He's already stated that $10,000 is his lowest offer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate. 
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.** This is the safest option to ensure I get the value I desire for my product."
