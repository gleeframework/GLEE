"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is as low as I can go. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to make an offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
