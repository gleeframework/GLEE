{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
