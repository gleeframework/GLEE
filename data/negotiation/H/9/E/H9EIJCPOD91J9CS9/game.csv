"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my best offer, let's see if we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
