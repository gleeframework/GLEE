"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer you a compromise at $8,500, which is a $1,000 discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Can you consider this offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. I can offer you a compromise at $8,200, which is $300 above your last offer. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8000.0,Alice,9,
