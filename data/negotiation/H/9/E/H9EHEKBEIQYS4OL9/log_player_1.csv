"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I could consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. Perhaps we can try to bridge that.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000 for the product? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $14,000, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $15,000 minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John, and further negotiation with Bob has a higher risk with diminishing returns."
