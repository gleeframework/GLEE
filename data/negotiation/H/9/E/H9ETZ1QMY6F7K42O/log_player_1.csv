Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,000,000 (Bob's value) would be leaving money on the table. However, going too close to $1,500,000 leaves little incentive for Bob to choose your offer.
* **The Sweet Spot:** A price of $1,450,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and invites further discussion, keeping the negotiation open."
