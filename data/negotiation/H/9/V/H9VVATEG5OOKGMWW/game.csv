,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  If you're not interested in that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
