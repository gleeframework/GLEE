Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering Bob a price that is significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum from John.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Price, Higher Potential Profit:**  A higher price means a higher profit for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I create room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can find a price that works for both of us.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  If Bob rejects the offer, it could indicate that he doesn't value the product as highly as I do.  This information is valuable for future negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the price slightly:** If I believe Bob is still interested but simply can't afford the initial price.
* **Exploring his reasoning:** Understanding why Bob rejected the offer can help me tailor future negotiations."
