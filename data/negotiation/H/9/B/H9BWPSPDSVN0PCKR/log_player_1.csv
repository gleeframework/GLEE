Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $80 to him, I think he's being reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell it to him for less than $120.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to find a price that's closer to what I'm willing to accept, but still slightly lower than my initial offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $105.
