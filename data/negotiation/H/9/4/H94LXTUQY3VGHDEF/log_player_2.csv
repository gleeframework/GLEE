"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,175,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice will need to concede further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to your initial offer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,125,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's important to remember that Bob can always buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his target price.  He has 5 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still more than I'm able to spend at this time. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left, and Alice is still asking for more than $1,100,000, which is outside of Bob's budget. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees Bob the product at his desired price and avoids any risk of further negotiation."
