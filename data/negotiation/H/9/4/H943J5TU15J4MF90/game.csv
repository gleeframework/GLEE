,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $75? That would be a fair deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about $85? I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $85 is close, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle at $80? That's the most I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
