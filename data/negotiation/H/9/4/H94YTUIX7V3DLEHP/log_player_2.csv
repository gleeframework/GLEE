Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $12,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go above my maximum price of $8,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's clear we're not going to agree on a price, so I'll buy the product from John instead."
