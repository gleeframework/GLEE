"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the impact it could have on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at a special price of $11,500. This represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive rate. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed with the purchase, please let me know. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. You're not losing anything at this point because you have a backup option with John."
