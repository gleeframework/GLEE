"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects that value. My asking price is $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
