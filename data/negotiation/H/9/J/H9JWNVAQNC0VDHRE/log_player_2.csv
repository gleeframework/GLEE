"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1400000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $1,500,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his desire to get a good price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a significant sum for Alice, making it a potentially agreeable starting point for negotiation.
* **Sets the tone for further bargaining:**  By starting with a lower counteroffer, Bob establishes the expectation that further negotiation will be necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1350000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by coming down from her initial $1,400,000 offer.
* **Close to Bob's target:**  $1,350,000 is only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer and is getting closer to his ideal price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise in future rounds, or that the negotiation could drag on unnecessarily.

**Conclusion:** It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is within his budget and represents a good compromise."
