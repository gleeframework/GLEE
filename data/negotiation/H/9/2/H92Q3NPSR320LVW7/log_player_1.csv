{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. It allows for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, but I don't want to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more than $12,500. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This still leaves a significant margin for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $13,000. This is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and within the range I'm comfortable with. It's also likely that continuing to negotiate won't result in a significantly higher price, so it's best to accept and close the deal."
