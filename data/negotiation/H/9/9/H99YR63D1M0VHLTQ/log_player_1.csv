Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we're not going to bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Taking John's guaranteed $1,000,000 makes the most sense now rather than risking further negotiation with Bob."
