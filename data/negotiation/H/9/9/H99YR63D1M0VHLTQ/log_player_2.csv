"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is way over his budget. He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too far below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer, or simply buying from John for $800,000."
