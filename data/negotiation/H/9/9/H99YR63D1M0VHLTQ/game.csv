"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too far below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
