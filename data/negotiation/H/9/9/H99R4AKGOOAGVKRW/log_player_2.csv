It's too early to buy from Alice. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $4,000 is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for us to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. $4,500 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her."
