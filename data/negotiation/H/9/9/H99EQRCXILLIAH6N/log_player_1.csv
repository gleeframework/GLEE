Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a significant profit margin.
* **Knowing Bob's value:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he's likely to accept a price slightly below that.
* **Leaving room for John:**  I'm keeping the price high enough that I wouldn't be significantly worse off selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't give me a satisfactory profit margin.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer that could potentially bridge the gap and lead to a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding a quick sale to John:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is an option, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Meeting halfway:** $9,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations stalled:** Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it still doesn't offer a satisfactory profit margin.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lengthy back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better price. There's a chance he might even lower his offer further.
* **Secure alternative:**  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price. This provides a quick and secure outcome without any further risk.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's wiser to secure the sale now rather than risk losing a potential deal with Bob and ending up with nothing."
