Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  it's always best to try for a higher price first.
* **Understand Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I need to offer a price that's significantly lower than my guaranteed sale but high enough to tempt him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,450,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a substantial profit for me. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a subtle psychological push for Bob to consider the deal seriously. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. There's no reason to go lower than my guaranteed sale price."
