{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 
* **John is a better option:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can try to negotiate with Bob further, potentially reaching a price closer to my minimum.  While there's a risk he might walk away, it's worth trying to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a compromise by lowering my price, but still staying well above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting benefits:**  I'm emphasizing that this price still benefits both of us, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not going too low to risk losing out on more profit.
* **Keeping the door open:**  I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation, indicating that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John guarantees a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By selling to John, I guarantee a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not budge. 

Although it's tempting to keep negotiating with Bob, selling to John is the more financially sound decision in this scenario."
