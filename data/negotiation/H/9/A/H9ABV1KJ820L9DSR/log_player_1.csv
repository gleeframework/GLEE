Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you need a price that works for you.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
