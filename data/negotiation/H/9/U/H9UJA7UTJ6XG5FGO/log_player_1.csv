Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for something of this value."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing you closer to your ideal price. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  If Bob refuses, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might accept $14,000 without negotiation. However, this strategy aims for the best possible outcome while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
