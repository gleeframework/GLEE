Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise at $8,400. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my desired value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8300? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and it's better than selling to John for a lower price. I'm confident that I'll get a better deal next time I sell a similar product."
