"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly below his perceived value. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $920,000 is still a bit above my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming higher.  Let's see if I can nudge him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to close the deal at $900,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $900,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'll offer $870,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting tight, but I believe I can still get Bob closer to $900,000. It's a risk, but the potential reward is worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer carefully.  I'm willing to accept a final price of $890,000.  This is a significant discount on my initial offer, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 890000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target. I'll offer $860,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's risky to push further.  Bob is unlikely to go above $860,000, and continuing the negotiation risks pushing him away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit."
