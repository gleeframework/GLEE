Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking for a better deal. Could you consider selling the product to me for $125? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $125 is a solid deal. It's a $25 profit, and further negotiation risks losing Bob altogether."
