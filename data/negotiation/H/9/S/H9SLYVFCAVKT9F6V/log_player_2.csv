You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $9,500. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating a lower price, but he's also offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum desired selling price of $8,000. This creates a space for compromise and keeps the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a better price than John's offer of $10,000, and it's also closer to Bob's desired price range. It's a good compromise and a reasonable price for Bob to accept. There's not much more room to negotiate, and further rounds might not result in a significantly better price."
