"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm confident it's still a great value for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and $1,080,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product at a price that works for my budget.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
