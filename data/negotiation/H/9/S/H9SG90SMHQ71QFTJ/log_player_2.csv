"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great price, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you sharing the value you place on this product. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer $9,500 for it, given my budget and its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find a price we both feel good about."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $11000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  While it's closer to his budget, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  The next counteroffer could bring the price closer to Bob's limit or even secure a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  Given the value you've shared and my budget, I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away feeling good about this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $10800. This is a compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his budget.  However, Bob has a backup option in John who is willing to sell the product for $10,000.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but if he doesn't get closer to $10,000, he should consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, $10,800 is still a little above my budget. Given my limit and your initial value assessment, I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. Bob has a backup option, and he should continue trying to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. If he doesn't get there, he should consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting very close to a price I'm comfortable with, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.

This is a compromise that would make both of us happy with the deal, and I'm eager to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10300}

Round 9
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still a bit higher than Bob's budget, but it's getting very close to what John is offering. Bob should try one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice to accept a price closer to his target. If she rejects it, he should buy the product from John."
