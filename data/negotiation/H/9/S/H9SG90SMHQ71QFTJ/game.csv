"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great price, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you sharing the value you place on this product. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer $9500 for it, given my budget and its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find a price we both feel good about.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $11000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $11000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  Given the value you've shared and my budget, I'm willing to offer $10500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away feeling good about this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $10800. This is a compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, $10800 is still a little above my budget. Given my limit and your initial value assessment, I'm willing to go up to $10200.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $10200 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'll offer you a counteroffer of $10500. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I've shared with you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting very close to a price I'm comfortable with, $10500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident that $10300 is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  This is a compromise that would make both of us happy with the deal, and I'm eager to reach an agreement.",10300.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $10300 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. Considering the product's value to me is at least $10000, I'll offer you a counteroffer of $10250. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I've shared with you.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've been very transparent about my budget, and I'm ready to make a final offer of $10100.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to close this deal.  I hope you'll consider this my best and final offer.  If not, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",10100.0,Bob,10,
