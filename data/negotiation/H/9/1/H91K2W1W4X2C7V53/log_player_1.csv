Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum desired price ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the value of the product to Bob ($8,000). 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, you've already made a good profit. 
* **Initiate a negotiation:** If Bob rejects, it opens the door for a back-and-forth to find a price that works for both of you.
* **Maintain leverage:** You can always fall back on John's offer if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, but it's still below your ideal profit margin.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). It shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Staying above minimum:**  The price is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out on profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge if Bob is willing to move closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below your initial desired price of $12,000, it's very close to your minimum acceptable price. It's important to consider:

* **Profit:**  You're still making a decent profit of $750, which is better than nothing.
* **Time:** Further negotiation might take more time and effort, potentially leading to further concessions on your part.
* **Opportunity cost:**  If you reject Bob's offer, you risk losing him as a buyer and might have to settle for John's offer later, which could be a lower profit.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is a good decision. It allows you to close the deal and secure a reasonable profit without risking further negotiation."
