"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can start with a counteroffer that's closer to your maximum budget and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. It's a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about negotiating a fair price. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come down to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll likely counteroffer with a price closer to my maximum budget, hopefully prompting Alice to come down to a price I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's last offer but still within my budget. It's a reasonable price that shows I'm willing to compromise but am still prioritizing saving money. This should hopefully push Alice closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
