I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for some room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still ensures I get a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to go that low.  John is offering a price that is closer to my minimum value, and I'm comfortable selling to him."
