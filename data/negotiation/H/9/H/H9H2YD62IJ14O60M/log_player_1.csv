I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This price is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always counter with a lower price or even sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hopefully we can reach an agreement close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a better price, Bob's counteroffer is still too low.  I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,000,000 for this product.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price."
