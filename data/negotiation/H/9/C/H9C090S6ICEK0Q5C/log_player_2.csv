"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth the same to Alice as it is to me, there's no immediate advantage in accepting her offer.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer.  If I can't get a better deal with Alice, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we start at $1,000,000? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $1100000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price for me considering the value of the product. It's also a better price than what John is offering. So, it makes sense to accept her offer and avoid further negotiation."
