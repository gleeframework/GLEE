"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some room to negotiate down.
* **Not Too High:**  $175 is still within a reasonable range, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, I'd prefer to try and maximize my earnings by negotiating with Bob. There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $140. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a Higher Price:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $150, I'm aiming for a higher profit if possible. There are still a few rounds left to potentially improve my offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my absolute minimum price, showing that I'm serious about this price point. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds (only 4 left).
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, even though it's not my ideal price.  It's a safe and sure way to secure a deal.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the deal altogether or ending up with a lower price.  

Given these factors, it's wiser to accept the guaranteed deal with John and move on."
