"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $15,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I've already made a significant price reduction.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I've been hoping we could work something out. I'm willing to go as low as $13,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not willing to pay $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is my final offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might lose out to the other buyer if I don't act soon.",11500.0,Bob,6,
