"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that, and it's higher than my guaranteed sale price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, you risk having to buy from John at $15,000. Accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to John's price."
