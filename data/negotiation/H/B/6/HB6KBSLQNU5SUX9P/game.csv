Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180.,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $160. How about we meet at $140? I really like the product and I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $152.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $152 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $145? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $155.,155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $148? I'm getting close to my limit, but I'd like to try to get a good deal on this product.",148.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $150. That's my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $148 and $150, so I'll offer it to you for $149.",149.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $149. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit worried that I might not be able to get this product at a price I like, and I'm considering buying it from John for $120.",145.0,Bob,10,
