{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range I'm willing to pay. This is a strong starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how far we can bridge the gap."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget of $12,000. It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from her, especially considering I can always buy from John at the same price."
