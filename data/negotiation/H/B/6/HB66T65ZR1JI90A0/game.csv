"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. While $1000000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product, I'm open to a compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price still offers you significant value, and allows me to continue realizing the potential of this opportunity. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
