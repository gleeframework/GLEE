# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. My starting price is $1200000, reflecting the significant value it holds for both of us. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.
