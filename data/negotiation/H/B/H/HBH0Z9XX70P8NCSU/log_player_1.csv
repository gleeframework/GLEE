Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $220 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $220 is already a significant discount on what I was initially hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $190?"", ""product_price"": 190}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $190 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:

We're getting closer, but I still think we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $170 is getting close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and call it $180? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $180 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and my original offer of $160. Would you consider $170? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $170 is still a decent profit above my minimum ($150).
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation out longer risks him walking away.  
* **Unlikely Improvement:** Bob seems firm at $170, and further haggling may not yield a better result."
