"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth, I am offering it to you for $15000. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less than $15,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, giving Alice room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to compromise, making it clear that he's open to further discussion."
