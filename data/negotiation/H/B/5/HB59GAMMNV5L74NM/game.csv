"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. This is my final offer on the higher end, and I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me here.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $12,600? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $13,050. This is my last offer above $12,600, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",13050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I can tell we're both ready to make a deal. How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $12,825?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",12825.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm willing to make one last push. I can offer you the product for $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm going to have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
