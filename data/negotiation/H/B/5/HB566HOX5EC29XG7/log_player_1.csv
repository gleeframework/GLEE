Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line.  
* **Open to negotiation:**  While aiming high, you signal a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** You don't know Bob's financial limits or how much he values the product beyond $800,000. There's a chance a very high offer could scare him off. 
* **Negotiation skills:**  Be prepared to back up your initial price and negotiate effectively if Bob counters."
