"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $500,000.  This product is important to me, but it's not worth $600,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $500,000, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the original value and your willingness to negotiate.",550000.0,Alice,3,
