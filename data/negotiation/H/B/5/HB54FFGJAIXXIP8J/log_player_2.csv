# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $500,000, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the original value and your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good price considering my value is $800,000. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether by pushing too hard is significant.  It's better to secure the product at this price than risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
