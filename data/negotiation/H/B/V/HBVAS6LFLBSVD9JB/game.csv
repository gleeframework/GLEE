"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000, which is still a significant investment for me, but closer to my budget.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable number.  I'd like to propose $950,000. This represents a significant step forward for me and is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a significant step for you, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm not ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my minimum requirements.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which represents a substantial investment for me, but is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975,000, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my minimum requirements.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still slightly outside my budget.  I'm firm on my last offer of $975,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your last offer of $975,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $985,000, which is just $15,000 above your last offer. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and my minimum requirements.",985000.0,Alice,9,
