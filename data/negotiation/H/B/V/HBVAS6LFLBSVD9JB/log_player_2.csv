"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your target price of $800,000. It's too early to accept, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and try to get closer to your target price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target price of $800,000. I'm still willing to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable number.  I'd like to propose $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a significant step for you, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm not ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my minimum requirements.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975,000, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my minimum requirements.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm not willing to accept a price higher than $975,000 right now. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'm close to the point where buying from John becomes a more attractive option."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still slightly outside my budget.  I'm firm on my last offer of $975,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your last offer of $975,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $985,000, which is just $15,000 above your last offer. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and my minimum requirements.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. While it's a significant compromise on her part, I'm reaching the end of the negotiation rounds and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is too high.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
