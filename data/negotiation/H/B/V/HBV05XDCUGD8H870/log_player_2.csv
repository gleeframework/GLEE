"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at a starting price of $14,500. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  $14,000 is still higher than the product's worth to Alice, and he can likely negotiate further.  He should reject and continue negotiating."
