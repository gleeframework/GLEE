"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm prepared to go down to $10,500.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is just not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,125. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $9,900?  This price works better for me and is a reasonable compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum threshold, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
