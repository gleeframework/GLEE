"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a steal considering its true worth. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm prepared to go down to $10,500.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is just not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,125. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen!",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $9,900?  This price works better for me and is a reasonable compromise. ",9900.0,Bob,6,
