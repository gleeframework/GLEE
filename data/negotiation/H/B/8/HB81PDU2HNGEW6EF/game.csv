"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 might be a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
