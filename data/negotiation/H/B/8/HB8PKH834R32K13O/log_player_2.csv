# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer.** By rejecting, you initiate a negotiation process, potentially saving money.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice."
