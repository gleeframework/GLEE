# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I see its value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value you've outlined, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that represents a good deal for both of us. This would be a substantial savings for me while still allowing you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
