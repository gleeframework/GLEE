"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation than to settle for a price that's still above your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for a significant profit for you while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit too high. You have a few more rounds to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to compromise further, especially since you're now close to her minimum price. It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation than to settle for a price that's still above your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and understand your need for a fair return on your investment. I'm prepared to offer $1,260,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget.  You only have three rounds left to negotiate.  It's not worth risking getting stuck with a price you're not happy with.  You can get the product from John for a price that's within your budget and ensures a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing the opportunity to buy from John is too high."
