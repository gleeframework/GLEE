"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This represents a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle, I still believe that $10,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  While I want to find an agreement,  $10,000 is too low for me to consider.  If you're willing to move closer to $15,000, I'm open to finding a solution.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go beyond $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,6,
