"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Could you consider $105 as a fair price for both of us?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about $108? That's just a little bit more than your offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within $100. Would you be open to $107?",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $107 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work out, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I'm unable to meet at $109. Could you consider $106?",106.0,Bob,8,
