Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low, and I can get a better price from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm ready to sell to John if it doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Could you consider $105 as a fair price for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll counter Bob again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about $108? That's just a little bit more than your offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within $100. Would you be open to $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I consider fair.  I'll make one last counteroffer to Bob.  If that doesn't work, I'm selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $107 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work out, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I'm unable to meet at $109. Could you consider $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. I've made several concessions, but it seems we're stuck. I'm better off selling to John for $120. It's not ideal, but it's better than settling for a lower price."
