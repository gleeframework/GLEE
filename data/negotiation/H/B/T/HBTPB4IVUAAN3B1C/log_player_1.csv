"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to potentially entice Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'm willing to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I also need to consider the possibility of going to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $100 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go all the way down to $80.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer the product for $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates my flexibility and makes him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** $90 is still above my minimum price of $100 and leaves room for potential future negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm using a friendly and direct tone to encourage further dialogue.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping an eye on my backup option with John.  If Bob continues to refuse, I'll be ready to move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to compromise. This is positive, indicating there's potential for a deal.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a higher price than $85. I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet. 
* **John Remains a Safe Option:** I'm aware of the possibility of selling to John for $100. This provides me with a cushion if the negotiation with Bob falls through.

**Important Note:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. Would you be willing to go up to $95? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  I'm once again proposing a compromise, this time by meeting Bob halfway between his $85 and my previous offer of $90.  This signals a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Getting Closer to My Target:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $100 but is getting closer to my desired price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Important Note:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm keeping a close eye on my backup option with John. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress in the next round, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. This brings us closer to each other's expectations and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is finally at my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only four rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject further offers.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I can always sell to John for $100, giving me a fallback option if this deal falls through.

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum and guarantees a sale. It also reduces the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection in the remaining rounds."
