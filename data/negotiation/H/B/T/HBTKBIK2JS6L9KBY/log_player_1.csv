Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, the difference is not substantial enough to risk losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Bob's offer is creeping up too slowly, and it's unlikely he'll reach a number significantly closer to John's offer."
