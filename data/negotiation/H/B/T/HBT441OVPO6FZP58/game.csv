"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this price is fair considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I'm really hoping we can close this deal, and I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,6,
