{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You still have a profit margin.
* **It's a reasonable price:** Bob might be willing to pay a little extra for a product he finds valuable. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit too steep for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:**  This demonstrates a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **It's above my minimum:** I still maintain a profit. 

I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept the deal."
