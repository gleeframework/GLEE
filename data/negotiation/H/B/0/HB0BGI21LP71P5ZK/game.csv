"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
