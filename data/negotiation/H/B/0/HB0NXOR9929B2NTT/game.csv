"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find fascinating. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1800000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $1400000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a significant increase in your offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1600000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
