"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I have to say that's as low as I can go. This is a tough decision for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
