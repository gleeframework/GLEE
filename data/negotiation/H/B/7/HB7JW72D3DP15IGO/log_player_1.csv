Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a 25% profit margin over your minimum. It's a common enough markup to be palatable but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Positive Language:** Framing the offer positively (""great deal,"" ""quality"") can make Bob more receptive."
