"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. 
* While Alice presents it as a discount, it doesn't align with your goal of saving money.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a much lower price."
