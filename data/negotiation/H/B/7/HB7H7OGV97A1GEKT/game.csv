"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I can do $13,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that works for you!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a good middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $11,000 is a bit low. I can meet you halfway at $12,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let me know if that works for you!",12500.0,Alice,5,
