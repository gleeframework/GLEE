"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I'm sure we can reach a fair price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,750.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,750 and my original offer of $10,500. How about $11,125?",11125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but $11,500 is my final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,300, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",11300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,300 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not able to go any lower than $11,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,400 is your best offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,400 and my previous offer of $11,300. How about $11,350?",11350.0,Bob,8,
