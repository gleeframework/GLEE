Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more to him than that, and I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer."

Round 3

This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,750 and my original offer of $10,500. How about $11,125?

I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but $11,500 is my final offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,300, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.

I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,300 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not able to go any lower than $11,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 11400}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I've negotiated as much as I can with Bob.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,350 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
