"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives you a great price and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,750 is still below my desired price point. How about we settle at $8,900? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close this deal and move forward. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
