"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125. Would you consider $117.50?",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $117.50 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $121.25? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",121.25,Alice,5,
