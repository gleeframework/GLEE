"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also expressing confidence in the product's value to entice him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125. Would you consider $117.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $117.5 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm not willing to sell the product below $120, so I'll try to get closer to that number by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $117.50 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $121.25? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 121.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $120, as that's my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the price John is offering. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's the same price John is offering. It's better to sell to Bob and keep the negotiation going, as I might be able to get a higher price in future rounds."
