"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $65.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
