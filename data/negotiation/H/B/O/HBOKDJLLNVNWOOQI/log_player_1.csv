Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this product, and I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring you get a price significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. This gives you a better chance of securing a sale above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, giving you leverage. This allows you to confidently propose a higher price to Bob.

**Important Note:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
