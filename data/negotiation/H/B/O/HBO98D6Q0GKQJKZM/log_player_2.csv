"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, and the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up buying from John at $12,000 is high. This is a good deal considering John's offer, and the negotiating process is likely to be more time-consuming and potentially unproductive."
