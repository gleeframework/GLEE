Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $150 offers a 25% profit margin if Bob accepts. This is a reasonable markup for many products.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you want to maximize profit, you don't want to scare Bob away with an outrageous price.  This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how badly he needs the product), you might adjust your offer."
