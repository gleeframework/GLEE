"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I'm interested in discussing a price closer to $10,000 if possible. Thank you!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. I'd like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's finalize this deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
