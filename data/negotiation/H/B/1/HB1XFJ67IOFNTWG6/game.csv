"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Bob,4,
