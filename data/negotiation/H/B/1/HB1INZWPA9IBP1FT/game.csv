"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it falls short of the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefit to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
