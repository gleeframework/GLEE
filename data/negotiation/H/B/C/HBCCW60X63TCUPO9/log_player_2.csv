# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John.** 
* Even though the product is only worth $80 to Alice, it's worth $150 to you, so getting it for $120 is a good deal."
