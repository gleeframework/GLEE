Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I believe it's worth $190, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). This might seem counterintuitive, but it establishes the perceived value of the product and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still below what John is willing to pay ($150), ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario! Alice gets a great price for the product.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide to go lower, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice can sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
