Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
