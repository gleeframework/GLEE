"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay something closer to my desired price, as the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a reasonable compromise that is still above my minimum price and closer to what I think Bob will be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to get nervous about the time running out, I'm still not comfortable selling for $90. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a smaller concession than before, but I think it might be enough to convince Bob to come to a deal. We're now in the middle ground between our desired prices, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more, time is running out and I'm starting to worry about losing the deal altogether.  $85 is only $5 less than selling to John, and I'm not confident I can convince Bob to go higher. It's time to take the deal."
