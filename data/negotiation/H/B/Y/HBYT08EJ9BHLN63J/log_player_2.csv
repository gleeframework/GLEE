"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to your business.  To start our discussion, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. It's a bold attempt to secure a lower price, but it still leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still over my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price. Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can do better with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to move but still staying within my budget. It's a reasonable jump from the previous offer, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit below what this product is truly worth.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. It's my final offer, let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is my maximum budget.  It's a good deal considering the value of the product and the fact that I could buy it from John for the same price. It's time to close the deal!"
