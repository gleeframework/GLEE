"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to your business.  To start our discussion, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit below what this product is truly worth.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. It's my final offer, let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
