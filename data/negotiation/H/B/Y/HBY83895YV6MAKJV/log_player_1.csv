Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  This price gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is beneficial for both of us.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me.  

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more agreeable price.  John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the benefits of the product and emphasize that this price is still a good deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what works for me. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

I'm not willing to accept such a large loss, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay a much higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,125,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm clearly communicating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Compromise:**  I'm still willing to negotiate, but this offer is closer to my desired price and reflects my need for a fair deal.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The final price is just above Bob's perceived value, so I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for him as well.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John's offer gives me confidence to hold firm on this price, as I'm not desperate for a sale."
