"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, aiming to give us more bargaining room. 
* **Not Insulting:**  While low, it's not an unreasonable offer considering our budget is $1,200,000 and John offers the product for that price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests willingness to negotiate further and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to your range, but her offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. You can try negotiating one more time to see if Alice is willing to go lower. If her next offer isn't satisfactory, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what works for me. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice exactly in the middle of her current offer ($1,250,000) and your previous offer ($1,050,000). 
* **Showing Progress:** It demonstrates that you are willing to move towards her price point, encouraging her to do the same.
* **Below John's Offer:**  It keeps you below your alternative option of buying from John for $1,200,000, ensuring you're still trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,125,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's offer of $1,200,000.  There's no longer a benefit to continuing negotiations or buying from John, as they both offer the same price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at your maximum budget."
