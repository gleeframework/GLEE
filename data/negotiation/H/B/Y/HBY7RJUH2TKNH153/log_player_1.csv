{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets the tone for a positive and mutually beneficial relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and the price I'm willing to pay, which is $12,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I feel the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,250. This still leaves room for profit for me and gives you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant drop from my desired price. I'm not willing to go any lower and risk losing money. It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit of $15,000."
