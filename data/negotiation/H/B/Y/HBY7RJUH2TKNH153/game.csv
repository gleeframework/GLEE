"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and the price I'm willing to pay, which is $12,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,250. This still leaves room for profit for me and gives you a great deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,4,
