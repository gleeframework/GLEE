Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me and reflects the product's true value.  I'm confident Bob will find this offer enticing, considering its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can still get closer to my goal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more appealing figure to Bob. I'm demonstrating flexibility, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but the negotiation with Bob has progressed enough that accepting his offer seems like the most logical choice at this point."
