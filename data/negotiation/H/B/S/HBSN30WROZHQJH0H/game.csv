"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $9,000 is quite a drop. I'm willing to budge a little. How about $9,750? That's a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,750 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about $10,250? This is a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
