"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, and allows for some negotiation space.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to sell it for that price just yet. There are still 9 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a little on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  While $110 is better than $100, there are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to offer $115. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $105.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher, but I have several rounds left to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110.  Since Bob is only offering $105, I'm going to meet him halfway to see if we can finally come to an agreement. This is a reasonable compromise and could be our last chance to get a higher price before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

There are only two rounds left, and while $102 is more than $100, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get Bob to go higher. I'm going to sell the product to John, as it is the best option at this point."
