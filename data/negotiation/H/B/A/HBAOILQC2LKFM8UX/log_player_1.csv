"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum acceptable price is $150.  I'll see how Bob reacts before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is way too low.  It's much less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before having to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $117.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to $150.  However, I'm starting to consider the option of selling to John if Bob doesn't come up with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165.  This is a compromise,  a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  If Bob doesn't accept, I might just take the guaranteed $150 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me.  I've made several concessions, and Bob's offers are still too low. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
