Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offering $11,500:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing you to make a decent profit. 
* **Why not start higher?** While a higher starting price might seem tempting, it could scare Bob away immediately, forcing you to accept a lower counteroffer or sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've made a successful sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  Wait for Bob's counteroffer and analyze it. If it's close to your acceptable range, consider accepting. If not, you can counteroffer again.
* **If negotiations drag on or become unfavorable:**  Always remember that you have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which is your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than his initial value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You're not under any pressure to accept this offer. You have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a better price. 
* **Option 3 is always available:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed win. You can use this as leverage during negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You can either counter with a price slightly lower than your original offer ($11,500) to show flexibility, or you can try to push for a higher price closer to $11,000, keeping in mind the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is a compromise, lower than your original offer of $11,500 but still higher than Bob's last offer of $10,500. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leverage:**  You're keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $12,000, which is a fallback position that gives you more negotiation power.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** You'll need to carefully evaluate whether to counteroffer again or sell to John, weighing the potential of further negotiations against the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
