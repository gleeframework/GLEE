"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that is significantly lower than its true market value. While I can't disclose the exact details now, I can assure you that this product is worth at least $1.2 million to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a very attractive price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
