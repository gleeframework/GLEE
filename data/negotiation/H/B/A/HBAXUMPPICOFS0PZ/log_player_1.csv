``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that allows me to earn more than my minimum price of $120, while still being attractive to Bob since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $140, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is still a good outcome. It allows me to earn more than my minimum price of $120.  Selling to John for $120 would only be a better option if I was certain I couldn't get a better price from Bob in future rounds."
