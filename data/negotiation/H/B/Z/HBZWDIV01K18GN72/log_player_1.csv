Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down.  I'm confident I can get at least $10,000 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that will get me closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price of $10,500. It's still higher than Bob's offer, but a significant decrease from my initial price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price from John.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
