Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between what you value the product at ($1,200,000) and what it's worth to Bob ($800,000). 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning you have other potential buyers, you introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,100,000, the message invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving room for potential negotiation if he counters.

This strategy balances securing a profitable deal with Bob against the guaranteed sale to John."
