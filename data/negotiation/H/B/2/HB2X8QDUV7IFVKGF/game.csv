"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see you value the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we possibly settle around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. I'll meet you at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would that be possible?",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're getting closer to my target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is as low as I can go. I'm willing to offer $12,200.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",12200.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob, but I still need to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I need to make it clear that this is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,9,
