"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,300,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our valuations, and allows us to finalize this transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
