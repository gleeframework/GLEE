"Bob, I believe this product is of great value to you, considering its potential worth to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers, while allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000. This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
