"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is of great value to you, considering its potential worth to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  While buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's more advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers, while allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's important to remember that buying from John for $1,500,000 is a fallback option, but not the most desirable outcome."
