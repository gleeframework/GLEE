"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to create a good first impression.

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky strategy, but it has potential. If Bob accepts, I get a great deal. If he rejects, I can then use the threat of selling to John for $1,000,000 to pressure him into a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my budget, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation room:**  I can still negotiate with Bob. He clearly values the product, and my threat of selling to John gives me leverage.
* **Potential for better offer:**  Bob's offer suggests he's willing to pay closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can get him to increase his offer further.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can get a better deal from Bob."

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have leverage with John's offer and can likely push Bob a bit further.

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Gap:**  The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is small, but it's worth trying to bridge that gap.
* **John's Offer:** The threat of selling to John for $1,000,000 keeps Bob motivated to increase his offer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While I understand your financial constraints, $1,025,000 is still slightly below my minimum. To be fair, how about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,037,500. This gives you a good deal and allows me to reach my minimum. Let's close this out now."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Clear Benefit:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob – a good deal – and the benefit for me – reaching my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The ""let's close this out now"" phrase adds urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** With only a few rounds remaining, I'm pushing for a deal that is close to my minimum.
* **Fair Compromise:** The halfway point is a fair compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose an offer of $1020000 for the product. This allows us to close the gap while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  While I could try to counteroffer again, the risk is too high. There's no guarantee I can push Bob higher, and I might lose out on a sale entirely.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Two rounds left is not enough time to guarantee a better offer from Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting John's offer is the safest option, minimizing the risk of losing out on any sale."
