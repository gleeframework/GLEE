Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
