Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $15,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some leverage.
* **Potential Value:**  The message highlights the potential value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! You've made a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects:  Listen to his counteroffer. Analyze whether it's close enough to your minimum price or if you should make a counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls:  Don't be afraid to walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at your minimum price.**  You're not going to get any more for the product from Bob. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee you can get a higher price in future rounds. Bob may walk away if you keep rejecting his offers.
* **Time is money:**  Selling to Bob now is quick and avoids the potential for a drawn-out negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* You've successfully sold the product to Bob!"
