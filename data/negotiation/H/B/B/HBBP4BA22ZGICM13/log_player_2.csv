"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice's offer is $140.  It's a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $130, which is still within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering my valuation and Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and I'd be left with only the option of buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
