Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $10,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Emphasize value:**  Mentioning the product's value to *you* (without revealing the exact minimum) creates a sense of potential bargain.
* **Open ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $8,000 gives me a solid fallback position if negotiations with Bob go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $8,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, so there's no benefit in continuing to negotiate.
* **No room for improvement:** While I might want more, Bob's offer is already at my limit. Further counter-offers are unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations risks losing him completely.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, especially since he already showed his maximum. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting the offer quickly avoids potential delays and ensures I get the minimum I want."
