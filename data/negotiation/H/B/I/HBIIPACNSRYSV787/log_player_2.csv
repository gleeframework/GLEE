"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
