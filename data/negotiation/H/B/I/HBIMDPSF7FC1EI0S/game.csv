"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a fair price that allows me to achieve my financial goals while offering you a substantial return on your investment. Please consider my offer carefully.  ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
