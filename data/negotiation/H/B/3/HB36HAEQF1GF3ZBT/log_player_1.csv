"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept since it's better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $120 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It also gives me a little bit more than my minimum while still being a potentially attractive option for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept given the limited rounds remaining, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I can always sell to John for $120 if things don't work out with Bob.  I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high. It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, which is more important than risking a lower price or potentially not closing a deal."
