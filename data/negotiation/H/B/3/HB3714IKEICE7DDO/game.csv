"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price still allows for a decent profit for you, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price still provides a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $987,500.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. ",987500.0,Bob,4,
