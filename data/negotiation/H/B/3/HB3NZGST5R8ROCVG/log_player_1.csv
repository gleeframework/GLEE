Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more,  $850,000 is a solid offer and surpasses my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk negotiations breaking down and getting stuck with John's offer."
