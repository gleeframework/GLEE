Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $11,500.

{""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since I can sell the product to John for $10,000, I'll consider that option as well.

In this case, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $10,000.
