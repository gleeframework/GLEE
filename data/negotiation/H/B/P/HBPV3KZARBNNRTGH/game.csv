"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product's value to me is not as high as you do, and I'd like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Consider the value you'll get from this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
