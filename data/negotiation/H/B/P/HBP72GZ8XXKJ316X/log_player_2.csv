"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth exploring better options before settling. Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still closer to my goal of $10,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
