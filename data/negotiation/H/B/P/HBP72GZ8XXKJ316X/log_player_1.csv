Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. Let's see if we can settle on $10,800. It's a small difference, and it would make this a win for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the sale at $10,800 than risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $12,000."
