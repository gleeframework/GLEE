"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and providing a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. This product offers significant value that I'm confident translates to a strong return on your investment.  Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what's on offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise and a fair price, considering the value the product holds for me.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my position.  Let's bridge the remaining gap â€“ I'm willing to come down to $980,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and acknowledges the value you'll gain from this product.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $980,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part and should still provide you with a good return.  Let's close this deal and finalize the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,6,
