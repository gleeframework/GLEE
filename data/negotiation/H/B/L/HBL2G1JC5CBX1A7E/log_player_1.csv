Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I still have several rounds left."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer of $1,300,000. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my expectations."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision. While I'm still not at my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds. If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,000,000. Given the limited time, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is the most prudent choice, as it secures a better price than selling to John."
