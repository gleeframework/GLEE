"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,060,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but I need to consider the value the product brings to you. Let's meet in the middle at $1,065,000. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'll meet you at $1,065,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the total price, making it $1,060,250. What do you think?",1060250.0,Alice,7,
