"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth significantly more to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm hoping we can settle a bit lower. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $975,000? This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  How about we settle at $960,000? I think that's a competitive offer and allows us both to walk away happy.",960000.0,Bob,6,
