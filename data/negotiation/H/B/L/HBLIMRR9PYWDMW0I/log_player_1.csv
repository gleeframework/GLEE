Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still below John's guaranteed offer. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not reaching the $1,500,000 mark. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice."
