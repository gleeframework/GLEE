"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $1,250,000? This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and is closer to your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,100,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
