"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1350000 for this product. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects its true value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's split the difference and go with $1300000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
