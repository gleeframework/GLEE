"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to set a strong initial position.  I'm hoping to get Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  It's important to keep in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any point, which gives me a strong safety net."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.  

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired value. I'll aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob but also allows me to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a compromise that still leaves me a significant profit margin, while also being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.  I believe this price is a good balance between my desire to maximize profit and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the time and effort invested in negotiation.  

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,550,000. This ensures I make a profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiations."
