"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $800,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe my product is worth more to you than $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the benefits it can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential benefits to both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price for my product. Considering the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While I'm closer to your price, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $925,000. I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $925,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise further without getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is the last time I'm willing to compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
