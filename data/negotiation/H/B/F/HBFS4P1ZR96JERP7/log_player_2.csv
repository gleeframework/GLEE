"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not ideal.**  It's significantly lower than John's price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  It's unlikely Alice will sell for $800,000, as her minimum value is $1,000,000. 
* **We have rounds to spare.**  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore a better price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $800,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe my product is worth more to you than $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still not ideal.**  $950,000 is a better price than her initial offer, but it's still higher than my desired target.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  Alice has already shown willingness to compromise. I believe there's a chance to get a lower price.
* **I have several rounds left.**  It's still early in the negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential benefits to both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price for my product. Considering the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still above my desired target.** $975,000 is a better price than her previous offers, but I'm still hoping to get it down a little further.
* **We're still in the early rounds.** With five rounds left, there's ample time for further negotiation. 
* **John's price provides a solid upper limit.**  Knowing I can buy from John for $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal. 

I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While I'm closer to your price, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $925,000. I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $925,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise further without getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is the last time I'm willing to compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm on her price.** She's clearly not going to budge below $975,000.
* **We're nearing the end of our rounds.** With only three rounds left, the chances of getting a better price from Alice are slim.
* **John's price is within my budget.** While not ideal, buying from John ensures I get the product within my price limit.

It's not the best-case scenario, but it's the most sensible option given the current situation."
