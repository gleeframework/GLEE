"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is my absolute limit. If this is acceptable to you, let's finalize the deal. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is your absolute limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $1520000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
