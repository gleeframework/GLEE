"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm proposing $950,000 as a final price. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $900,000? This is my final offer, so let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. Can we meet at this price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
