"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product's value is significantly higher than that, and I'm confident it will provide you with substantial returns.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for both of us, while acknowledging the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

``` 
Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  At this point, it's likely that Alice will be hesitant to drop the price further, so accepting the offer is the best way to ensure Bob gets the product without exceeding his budget."
