"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a fantastic product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
