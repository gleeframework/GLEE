"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would allow us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you can't go as low as $5,000, Alice.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference and settle on $7,500.  This is a fair price that we can both agree on.",7500.0,Alice,5,
