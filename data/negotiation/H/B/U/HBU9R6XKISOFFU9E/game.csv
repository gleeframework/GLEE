"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is still a compromise from my original offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
