{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I will try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your interest and we're getting closer. $115 is still just a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $118? It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $118 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $118. Would you consider $116? I'm really close to walking away if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $116 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I've already made several concessions, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge further.  I'm not comfortable going any lower, so I will sell to John for $150 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
