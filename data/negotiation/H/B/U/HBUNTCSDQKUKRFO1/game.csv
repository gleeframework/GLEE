"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can work something out.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest and we're getting closer. $115 is still just a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $118? It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $118 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $118. Would you consider $116? I'm really close to walking away if we can't come to an agreement.",116.0,Bob,6,
