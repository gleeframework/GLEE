Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being above the minimum value for me.
* **""Fantastic deal""**: This phrase subtly emphasizes the value Bob would be getting and might encourage him to accept. 

I'm opening the negotiation with a strong offer, hoping to secure a good price without pushing Bob away. However, I'm ready to counter-offer if needed and always have the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I want to close the deal, I won't settle for less than the product's minimum value to me. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair compromise:** I emphasize this point to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Significant value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for less than the product's minimum value to me.

Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get my desired value and avoids the potential for a deal below my minimum."
