"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and our current positions.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. My final offer is $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $765,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a decent profit on this sale.",765000.0,Alice,7,
