"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",90.0,Alice,5,
