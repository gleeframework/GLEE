"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $2000 to get your hands on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is within his budget and a better deal than Alice's offer."
