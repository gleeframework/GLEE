"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to increase his offer slightly in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer, trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. It also gives me a good profit while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and try to close the deal for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by counteroffering with $975,000. This is a small increase from his last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking losing the deal in the next round."
