"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). This allows for room to negotiate and sets a high expectation for the product's value.
* **Friendly opening:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, highlighting the opportunity for Bob.
* **Value justification:** I briefly mention the ""true value"" of the product to encourage Bob to consider the price seriously. 

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for potential negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 mark I'm comfortable with.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding settling too early:**  Selling to John right now would secure a safe, but lower profit. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially achieve a higher price.

**Next step:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,400,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage a compromise.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is valuable, hoping to reinforce his desire to acquire it. 

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us, while still remaining within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, but there's no room for negotiation. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and with 6 rounds remaining, I'm worried about getting a better offer. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer guarantees me $1,200,000. This is a safe bet, and I'm not willing to risk losing time and potentially ending up with the same amount.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John guarantees my desired profit with no further negotiation needed."
