Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, great! If not, it provides valuable information about his negotiating range.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  $10,000 is a significant profit for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By not starting at a high price like $12,000, it allows for a more flexible negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.
* **Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation.** You still have leverage, and you can try to get a better price in the next round.
* **Selling to John guarantees your minimum desired profit.** However, there's still potential to make more with Bob, so it's worth exploring the negotiation further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare a counteroffer:** You need to find a price that is acceptable to you while still being potentially attractive to Bob. Consider something slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than your minimum price.
* **Communicate clearly:** Explain your reasoning for rejecting his offer and emphasize the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which reflects the significant value of this product. I'm confident this price is fair to both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,500 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer and still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** This message emphasizes the value of the product while showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still a significant profit for you while giving Bob a chance to come up slightly.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** By showing a commitment to negotiation, it encourages Bob to consider your offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to go above $8,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is not willing to budge on his offer.**  He's stuck at $8,000, which is far below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.**  There's a clear impasse, and continuing to negotiate would likely only waste time. 
* **Selling to John guarantees a good outcome.**  While you'd prefer to get more, selling to John ensures you receive your minimum desired profit of $12,000.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, it's in your best interest to sell the product to John.  While you might hope to get more, the risk of further negotiation failing and getting stuck with a lower price is too high. John provides a guaranteed profit and a secure outcome."
