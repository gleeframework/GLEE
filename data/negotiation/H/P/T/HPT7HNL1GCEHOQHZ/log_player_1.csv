The risk of going lower than $150 is not worth it. There's a chance Bob might increase his offer, but it's also possible he might stick to his $130, and I'd end up losing money compared to selling to John."

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I could keep negotiating with Bob, the risk of him not increasing his offer is too high. Selling to John guarantees me the $150, which is a much better outcome than potentially ending up with $120 or less."
