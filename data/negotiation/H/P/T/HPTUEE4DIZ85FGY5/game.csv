"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
