Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
