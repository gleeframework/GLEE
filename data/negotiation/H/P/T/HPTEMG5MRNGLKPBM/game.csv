"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $12000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price? I'm willing to pay up to $9500 for it.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $11000 is slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10500? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me.",10750.0,Alice,5,
