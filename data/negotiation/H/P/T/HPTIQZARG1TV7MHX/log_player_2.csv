"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $140
* **Your Value:** $150 
* **John's Price:** $150

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $150 to John. This is still within your budget and only $10 more than Alice's offer. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth rejecting Alice's offer to see if you can find a better price later."
