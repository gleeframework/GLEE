"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could settle for $1,200,000,  it's below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  I've made several concessions, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a deal that meets my minimum requirement.  At this point, selling to John is the best option to guarantee I get a price I'm comfortable with."
