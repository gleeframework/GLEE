"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He can get the product for less from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows that the product is worth $800,000 to him. This is the maximum he is willing to pay.  By offering the lowest price, Bob puts the pressure on Alice. If Alice wants to sell to Bob, she needs to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants."
