Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow me to reach my desired price point."", ""product_price"": 10875}
