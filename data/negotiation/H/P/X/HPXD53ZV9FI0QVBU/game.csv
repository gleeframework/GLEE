"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs.  Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow me to reach my desired price point.",10875.0,Alice,5,
