"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum of $12,000, you can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is worth it:** You have 10 rounds and a clear goal of saving money. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  My counteroffer is $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer, which is a significant amount. However, it's still within the range where a deal is possible, considering the product's value to Alice.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, emphasizing both the product's value to Alice and my budget constraints. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to respond and potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Strategic counteroffers:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better price.
* **Avoiding John:** While John is an option, I'm confident that I can achieve a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** My counteroffer is only $250 higher than my previous offer, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway.
* **Maintaining a fair stance:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise, emphasizing that it's a fair deal for both of us.
* **Setting the stage for a deal:** By offering a specific price, I'm putting pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow me to reach my desired price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Alice's offer is only $375 higher than my desired price of $10,500. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, I'm nearing the end of the rounds and want to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Value of the product:** Considering the product is worth $12,000 to me, a price of $10,875 represents a significant saving and is a reasonable compromise."
