"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is under your $100 limit, you can try to get a better price.  You know John will sell it to you for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting the product for less than $90."
