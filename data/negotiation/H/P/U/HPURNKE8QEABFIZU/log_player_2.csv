"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking for $95. This indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have room to negotiate:** Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to pay up to $100.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer:** By rejecting, you initiate the negotiation process and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My offer of $85 is a significant drop from Alice's $95, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $85 is closer to my maximum price, it's still above Alice's perceived value, indicating that there's space for us to meet in the middle.
* **Clear communication:**  My message is direct and friendly,  stating my counteroffer and inviting Alice to respond."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a lower price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  My counteroffer is a smaller reduction than before, showing that I'm taking her offer seriously and moving closer to her position.
* **Splitting the difference:**  $87.50 is halfway between our last two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes fairness and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
