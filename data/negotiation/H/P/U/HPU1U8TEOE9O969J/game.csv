"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $800,000 is too significant a gap. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that this product represents value to you, and I'm definitely interested. However, to make this work for me, I need to be around the $1,000,000 mark.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can go up to $1,200,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go. It's a fair offer, considering the alternatives.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
