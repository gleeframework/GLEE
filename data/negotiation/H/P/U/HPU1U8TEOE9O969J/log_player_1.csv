"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We're aiming for the best possible price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Starting significantly higher than his perceived value leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of premium value. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential and positions it as a worthwhile investment, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives us ample space to negotiate down over the next 10 rounds while still aiming for a price well above our minimum.

**Important Note:** We have John as a backup option, guaranteeing us $1,500,000. This allows us to be more ambitious in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  We have room to negotiate and John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $800,000 is too significant a gap. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price by $400,000, which is a substantial move designed to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm Above Value:** We are still significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value of the product. This maintains a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating our willingness to be flexible to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this product represents value to you, and I'm definitely interested. However, to make this work for me, I need to be around the $1,000,000 mark.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Our Minimum, But Not There:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to our absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  However, we still have room to negotiate, especially since he's now above his perceived value. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, we need to start pushing Bob closer to a more acceptable price point. Accepting now might leave too much money on the table.
* **John as Backup:** We still have the option to sell to John for our minimum price, providing a safety net if negotiations completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to come down further to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's genuine worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering the price by $300,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but still staying firmly above Bob's offer.
* **Midpoint Target:** We're aiming for a price point around $1,550,000 - $1,600,000, splitting the difference between our initial offer and his last counteroffer. This could be perceived as a fair compromise.
* **Time Constraint:** With the round count decreasing, we need to guide Bob towards a close while ensuring we don't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Urgency and Directness:**  The tone of the message encourages a decision, subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can go up to $1,200,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go. It's a fair offer, considering the alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:** While Bob has increased his offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly below our $1,500,000 minimum and our target price.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  Bob's statement about being ""close to his limit"" is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us into accepting a lower offer.
* **John as Leverage:** We have a strong alternative with John, ensuring we don't have to settle for a price that's significantly below our minimum.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have four rounds to negotiate.  We'll use the next round to convey the seriousness of the situation and gauge Bob's true willingness to move closer to our price range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making a small concession ($50,000), signaling a degree of flexibility, but we're also drawing a firm line.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we're creating urgency and signaling that we're serious about walking away if he doesn't meet our price.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, subtly reminding him why this deal is worthwhile.
* **Calculated Risk:** We're cutting it close to our $1,500,000 minimum, but the risk is calculated. Bob's negotiation tactics suggest he might be willing to meet us halfway.
* **John as Backup:** We still have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum price, minimizing the risk of this final offer."
