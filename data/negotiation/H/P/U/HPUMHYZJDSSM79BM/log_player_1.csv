Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  $10,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly above your minimum price of $8,000.  We'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
