,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.  How about $1300000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value it holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still below what I need to accept.  Let's try to meet halfway - how about $1350000?  It's a significant amount for you, and it allows me to get a better price for my product.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1200000? I've already made a few concessions, and I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
