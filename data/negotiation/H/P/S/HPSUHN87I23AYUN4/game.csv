"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Could you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $13,000. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Can you consider that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is cutting it a bit too close. How about we settle at $12,500? This keeps us closer to a fair valuation.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'd like to try to meet you at $11,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  Let's wrap this up - $11,750 and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $11,750. I'd like to make a serious offer of $10,800. This is my final counteroffer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",10800.0,Bob,8,
