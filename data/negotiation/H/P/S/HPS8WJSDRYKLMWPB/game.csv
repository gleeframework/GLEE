"I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $160, but I was thinking more along the lines of $170. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $165 and $170. How about we say $167.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",167.5,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we say $168? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",168.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we say $165.50? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it.",165.5,Alice,9,
