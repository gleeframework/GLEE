"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is a tough ask, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $16750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,5,
