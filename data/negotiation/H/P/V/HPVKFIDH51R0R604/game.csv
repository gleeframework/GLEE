"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  The product seems promising, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1200000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1350000.  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
