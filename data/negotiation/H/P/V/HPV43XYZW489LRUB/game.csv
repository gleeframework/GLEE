"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $130. This is my best price for now.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $115? ",115.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $120, but I'm not going any lower than that. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
