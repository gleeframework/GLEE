"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1800000. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still reflects the value of the product while showing my willingness to negotiate. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I still think $1600000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1520000. Can you consider this compromise?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1520000 is still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1560000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1560000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1560000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1520000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1520000.0,Bob,6,
