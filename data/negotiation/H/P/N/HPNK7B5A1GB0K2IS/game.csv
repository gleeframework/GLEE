"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we consider $1,900,000? This offer takes into account some of your concerns while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need a price closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's try to find a compromise in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. To show I'm serious about making a deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair offer given the product's potential value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution closer to the middle ground.  How about we split the difference and try $1,200,000?  This would allow me to acquire the product while still staying within my financial limits. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but we need to be realistic. This product has significant value, and $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect that. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a very small margin from my guaranteed offer from another buyer, and I'm only offering it because I believe in the potential of this product for you. Let me know your decision soon.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
