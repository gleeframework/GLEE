Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  I need to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a fair deal, and it avoids further negotiations."
