"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial amount. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it falls short of what I believe to be a fair reflection of this product's true value and potential. I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000.  I feel this is a strong offer, and I'm eager to see this beneficial transaction come to fruition.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your constraints, and I want to ensure this deal works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement on this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I truly believe this product has the potential to be very valuable. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
