Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $10000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $10,800 is still a bit low for me, especially since it's worth $12,000 to him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still not worth it for me to keep negotiating.  I'd rather sell it to John and get the guaranteed $10,000."
