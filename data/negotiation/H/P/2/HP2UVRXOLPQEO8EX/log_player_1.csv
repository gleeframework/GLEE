Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee the sale, offering it at $15,000 would be the safer approach."
