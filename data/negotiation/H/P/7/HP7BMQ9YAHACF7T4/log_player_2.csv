"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's too early to tell if $850,000 is a good deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested!

While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer right now.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $700000. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but she's clearly not going much lower.  $725,000 is a good price for the product, especially considering that John is asking for $1,500,000.  It's time to close the deal."
