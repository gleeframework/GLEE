Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000.  I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle above our minimum ($8,000).
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering a price too close to $8,000 might leave money on the table. Conversely, a price too close to $15,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer outright."
