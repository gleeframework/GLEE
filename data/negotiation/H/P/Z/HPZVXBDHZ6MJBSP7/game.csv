,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13000?  I'm really interested in your product, but that's my top price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13750?  It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit too high.  How about we settle at $13500?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that.",13500.0,Bob,4,
