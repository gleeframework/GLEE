Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8200 is simply too low for me.  My product is unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  Considering the value of this product and the fact that I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $10000, I'm willing to come down to $8800. This would be a great deal for you, and we can both walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
