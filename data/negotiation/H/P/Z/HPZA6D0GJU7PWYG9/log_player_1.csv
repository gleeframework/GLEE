{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and gives you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message makes it clear you're open to discussion, which can lead to a more positive negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that works for both of you.  Be prepared to counter Bob's offers and be firm in your own pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. It's also below my previous offer of $9,500.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll aim for something like $9,000 and try to explain why my product is still worth that much. I'll also be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  My product is unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500. That's the highest I can go, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant distance away. I'm not comfortable selling for that price, as I believe I can still achieve a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer of $9,000. I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the fact that John is also interested in buying it. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  Considering the value of this product and the fact that I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This would be a great deal for you, and we can both walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8400. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Even though I've been willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely that Bob will come up to a price that works for me.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John.

**Why Sell to John?**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me a profit.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be time-consuming and uncertain, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal. 
* **Time is Valuable:**  It's better to close the deal with John and move on to other opportunities."
