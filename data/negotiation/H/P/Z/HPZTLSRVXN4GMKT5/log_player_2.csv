Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,250. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250.

```

At this point, Alice is holding firm at $7,250.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely you'll get a price that beats John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
