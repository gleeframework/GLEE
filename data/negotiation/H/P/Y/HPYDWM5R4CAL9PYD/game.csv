"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $10,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,500 is closer, but it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I must adhere to my budget. I am proposing a counteroffer of $9,600. This brings us closer together, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I look forward to your response.",9600.0,Bob,4,
