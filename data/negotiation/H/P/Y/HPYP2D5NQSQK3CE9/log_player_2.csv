Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $2,000,000 is still significantly below its true value to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but you are getting closer to a potential deal.  Continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  You still have the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, but it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
