"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $90. If you're willing to come down, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I may have to look elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price by offering $110, and now I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
