# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say? Will you accept my offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While you could potentially get it for less from John, Alice's offer still saves you $300,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
