"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $12,000 for it. This is my final offer. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I respect your position, but I'm still only able to offer $10,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look at other options. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
