Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that we are unlikely to reach a deal that significantly surpasses John's offer.  Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point carries the risk of leaving money on the table. It's more strategic to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
