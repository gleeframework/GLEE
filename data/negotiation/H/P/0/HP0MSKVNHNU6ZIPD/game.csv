"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
