```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is above the minimum I'm willing to accept and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of the product and I believe Bob will recognize its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I will counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that's still within my desired range and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
