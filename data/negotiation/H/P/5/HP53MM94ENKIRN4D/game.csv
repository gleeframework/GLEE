"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,700,000. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable accepting $1,500,000. It's important to me that the sale reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for you to benefit significantly. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,700,000, which would be $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,575,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a final compromise at $1,650,000. This price acknowledges the value we both see in this deal, while ensuring a fair return for me. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial outcome.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,650,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can reasonably pay for the product, considering its value and the market rate. I hope you can understand my position and meet me halfway.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
