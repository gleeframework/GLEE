Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but allows room for negotiation. It also leaves you with a profit of $100,000, which is better than the $0 profit you'd make by selling to John right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is a good deal, it's still less than what you'd get from John.  You can do better by counter-offering and trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
