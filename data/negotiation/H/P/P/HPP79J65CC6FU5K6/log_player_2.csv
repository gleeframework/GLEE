Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should reject the offer. It's significantly higher than his budget, and there are more rounds to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $16,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $16,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice is getting closer, $14,000 is still above Bob's budget. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $14,000 is still a bit high.  How about $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
