Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal considering its true value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $1,150,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely for him to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A price of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, meaning a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Avoid unnecessary delay:** The offer is enticing enough to potentially secure a deal quickly, minimizing the risk of losing Bob and having to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  While accepting Bob's offer would lead to a quick sale, it would result in a major loss for Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $1,050,000 is a compromise between Alice's initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  The message maintains a friendly tone while emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and the need for a fair deal for Alice. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Stay above the minimum acceptable price:**  Alice remains committed to getting at least $1,200,000 for the product.
    * **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  By making a counteroffer, Alice shows she's open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
    * **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** The counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now within Alice's acceptable range, as it's above her minimum price of $1,200,000.  While Alice could continue to negotiate, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a profit.  Furthermore, there's a risk that continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out altogether."
