"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $160. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial offer was unreasonable for me.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly states that the initial offer was unacceptable.
* **Strategic Goal:** My aim is to gauge Alice's flexibility and work towards a price closer to my target while keeping in mind I have the option to buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Raising the Stakes:**  I'm increasing my offer but staying below my maximum. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a price closer to my limit, I'm adding a bit of pressure for Alice to make a decision soon.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering $110 is a compromise, but I'm still aware that going over $100 means losing money compared to John's offer."
