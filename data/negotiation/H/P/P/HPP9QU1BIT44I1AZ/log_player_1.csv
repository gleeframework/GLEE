"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price represents a good deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,075,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a deal but still above Bob's offers. By stating this is our final offer, we're adding a bit of pressure for Bob to accept while leaving ourselves a small cushion to go lower if needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is sticking to his previous offer, but we're not out of time yet. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're serious about the $1,100,000 and put the ball back in his court to make a significant move. We'll see if he's bluffing or if he's willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to leave this offer open for one more round for you to reconsider."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're sticking to our guns here, reiterating the $1,100,000 offer while also introducing a soft deadline. This emphasizes our position while still giving Bob a chance to meet our price.  The next round will be crucial in determining if we can reach a deal with Bob or if we should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has returned to his earlier offer and signaled that he's unwilling to budge.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum desired price ($1,200,000) and avoids further risk or time spent haggling."
