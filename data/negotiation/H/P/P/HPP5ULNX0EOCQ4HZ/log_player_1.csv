Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also starts the conversation with a positive and friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll go $90. That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still less than what I'd ideally like, it's a decent compromise.  It's also close to the price John would pay, so it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing a sale."
