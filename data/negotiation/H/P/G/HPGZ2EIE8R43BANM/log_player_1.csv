Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $110 leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process. 
* **Above My Minimum:**  The offer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price from Bob. His offer is considerably lower than my initial ask, suggesting room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $100, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing makes the offer seem more appealing and fair to Bob.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $100 still ensures a healthy profit margin, keeping the negotiation favorable for me."
