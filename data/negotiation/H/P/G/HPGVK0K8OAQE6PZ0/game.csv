"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950000. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $950000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point to reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
