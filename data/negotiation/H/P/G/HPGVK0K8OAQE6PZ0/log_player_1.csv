"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** This strategy aims to:
    *  See if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate.
    *  Start the negotiation at a point where there is room for compromise.
    *  Leave room for counteroffers and potential deal-making. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response. 
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If he accepts, I'll finalize the transaction. 
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. 
* **My Strategy:** I'm not willing to accept such a low offer right away. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Next Steps:** I will reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer in the next round to bridge the gap between our positions.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Accepting Bob's offer so early in the negotiation would weaken my position. It would signal to Bob that I'm desperate to sell.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds to close a deal, and I can still sell to John if I feel like the negotiation is not progressing favorably."
