"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence and Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and my confidence in the offer, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer sets the stage for a negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price. I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which gives me the opportunity to adjust my price based on his response and assess whether I want to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I believe there's still room to get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and willing to wait for a better price.  This move keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise and Value:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the product's value.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob for his opinion.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. It demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob, but also signals that I won't settle for a price significantly below my target. I'm hoping this offer will entice Bob to agree to a deal, avoiding the need to move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap between our offers is still significant.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not ready to abandon the negotiation with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum threshold. This move keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap between our offers. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum threshold. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining my negotiating power.
* **Compromise and Value:** I emphasize that this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we try to finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our offers while keeping the negotiation moving forward.  It's a step towards finding a mutually acceptable price. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to agree, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating in the remaining rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $925,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Negotiation Progress:** We're getting closer to an agreement, but there's still room for a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you're working with a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between our last offers, showing a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the need to close the deal, subtly creating a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:**  I highlight that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to finalize the deal by presenting a compromise that is likely acceptable to both parties. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in closing the deal and accept this offer.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to consider John's offer in the next round, as we only have 3 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer $910,000 as a final compromise.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's final offer of $910,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed way to secure my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I've reached a point where I need to prioritize securing my minimum price.  With only two rounds remaining, there's a high risk that I won't be able to get a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John ensures that I receive my desired amount, even if it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob."
