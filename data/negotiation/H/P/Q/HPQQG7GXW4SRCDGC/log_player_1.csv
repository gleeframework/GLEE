"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and your potential profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll need to try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750? It's a fair compromise that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** While $7,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob but need to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,250 as a compromise. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to recoup my costs."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $7,900?  That's a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**  While $7,900 is better than the previous offers, it's still a significant drop from my desired price. With only four rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
