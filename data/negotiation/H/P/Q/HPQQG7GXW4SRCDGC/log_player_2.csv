"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and your potential profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and establishes my target price range. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still quite far from my ideal price. I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to my limit, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750? It's a fair compromise that considers both our positions."",
 ""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($7,000). It keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,250 as a compromise. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to recoup my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to play it a bit closer to the chest.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push her a little further down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $7,900?  That's a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that."",
 ""product_price"": 7900
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strategic move. I'm pushing closer to my limit, but I'm also making it clear that I'm serious about buying and ready to close the deal if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. This approach balances my desire for a good deal with the risk of losing the opportunity to Alice's potential counteroffer."
