Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal to you given its potential. How does $14,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $14,000. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a premium price reflects the potential ""deal"" he's getting before you go to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we don't know Bob's negotiation style. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, we might adjust our initial offer slightly lower.
* **Relationship Building:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, leaving the door open for further discussion is important."
