Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I want to start with a higher offer to see if I can secure a price above my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still potentially landing on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
