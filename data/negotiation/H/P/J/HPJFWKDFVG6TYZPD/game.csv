"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
