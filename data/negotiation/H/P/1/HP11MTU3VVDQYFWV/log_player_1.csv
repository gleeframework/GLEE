Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you're in a strong position. Starting with a higher offer of $1,400,000 allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he accepts the $1,400,000, that's ideal. If he negotiates, you have a buffer to potentially still get a price higher than John's offer."
