"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to save more money.  There's no guarantee that Alice won't lower her price further if you reject her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,000? I'm confident this price is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still a good deal for me, saving me $3,500 from John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying more. It's safer to accept her current offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
