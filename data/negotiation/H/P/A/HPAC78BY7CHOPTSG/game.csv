"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
