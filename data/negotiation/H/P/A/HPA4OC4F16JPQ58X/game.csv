"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $800,000?  It's a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This price still reflects the product's value while allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $925,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $860,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",860000.0,Bob,4,
