"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
