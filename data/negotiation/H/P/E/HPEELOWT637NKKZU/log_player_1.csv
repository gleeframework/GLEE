Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure if it's worth $120 to me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you and the value it could bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
