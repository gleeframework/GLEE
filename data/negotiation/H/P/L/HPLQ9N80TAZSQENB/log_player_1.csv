Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,200,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  $800,000 - $1,200,000

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is higher than your reservation price but still within Bob's potential acceptance range. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its benefits to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your guaranteed price, you hint at the product's value exceeding Bob's perceived $800,000.
* **Confidence:**  The tone is firm and implies this is a serious offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob reacts will determine your next move.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,200,000 guarantee.
* **Alternative Buyers:** The presence of John strengthens your position, but you don't need to mention him explicitly to Bob."
