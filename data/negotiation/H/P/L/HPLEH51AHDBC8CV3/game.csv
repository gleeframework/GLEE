"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $700,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get the fair price I'm looking for. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a little rich for my blood.  How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant investment for you but still a fair price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
