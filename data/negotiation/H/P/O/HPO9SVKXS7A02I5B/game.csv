"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000, but that's still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to make a compromise, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
