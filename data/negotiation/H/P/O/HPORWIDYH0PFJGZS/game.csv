"Alice, $110 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a good value.",95.0,Alice,3,
