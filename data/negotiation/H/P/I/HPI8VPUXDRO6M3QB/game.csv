"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this product realizes its full value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal happen.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making a deal, let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. Let's be completely transparent. I have another buyer ready to purchase this product for $1,500,000. To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price given the circumstances.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering your alternative buyer. If you're truly interested in a deal, let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
