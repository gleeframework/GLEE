Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $1,000,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** $1,000,000 is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000), making the offer attractive to him.
* **Opportunity cost:** This offer gives Bob a $200,000 gain if he accepts. If he rejects, you'll still make $800,000 from John.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing the risk of a rejected offer."
