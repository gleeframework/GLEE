"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I understand this is a unique product, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the potential value of this product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
