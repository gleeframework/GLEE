I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $850000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is lower than the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, I'd rather sell the product to John to maximize my earnings.
