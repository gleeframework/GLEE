"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $130, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is less than your maximum price, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. You can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
