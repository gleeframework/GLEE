Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have your budget, but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Would you be willing to consider $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds to play with.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before I go that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000, but this is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.  "", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but that's my final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and while Bob's offer of $1,290,000 is better than his previous ones, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, I'm not sure I can push for a higher price.  To avoid the risk of losing out completely, it's time to secure the deal with John for $1,500,000."
