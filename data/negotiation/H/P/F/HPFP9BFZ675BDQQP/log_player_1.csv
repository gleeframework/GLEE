{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and friendly while setting a price that's within your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit though. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $130 is closer to my desired range and a fair compromise.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob and avoid the risk of losing him completely or having to settle for John's offer."
