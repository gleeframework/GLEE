"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. It's a rare and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no immediate incentive to accept. By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving some money.  While buying from John is a guaranteed option, it doesn't allow for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to my initial budget of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and I might end up paying the full $12,000.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price."
