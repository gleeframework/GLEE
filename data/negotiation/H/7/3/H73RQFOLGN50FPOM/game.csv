"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've already invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway at $200, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $225. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot between $200 and $225.",220.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $210, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $215, and I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product?",215.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm grateful for the additional offer, Alice. However, considering my budget, I'm hoping we can still find a way to work within $210. I'd like to propose a price of $210 without any additional bonuses. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",210.0,Bob,8,
