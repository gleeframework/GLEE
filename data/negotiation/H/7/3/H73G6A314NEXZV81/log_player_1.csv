This is a starting offer, aiming to get a high price. I'm starting with $1,500,000, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident in the value of the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,350,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer more, I'm worried about continuing to negotiate and risking losing the deal. I'm confident that I can do better than John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000."
