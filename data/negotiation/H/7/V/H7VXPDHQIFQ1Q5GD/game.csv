"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price point is a bit too high for me. How about we settle somewhere around $700,000? I think that's fair considering the market and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I'm very interested in the product, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $760,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
