"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $140 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to meet in the middle.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will tell us how eager she is to sell. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a little on her price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming to get as close to $110 as possible without risking the deal by being too aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're proposing a price directly in between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This signals fairness and willingness to compromise.
* **Testing Alice's bottom line:** $120 is the value Alice places on the product. This offer will reveal if she's willing to sell at her minimum or if she needs to make a profit.

Let's hope Alice sees this as a reasonable compromise!"
