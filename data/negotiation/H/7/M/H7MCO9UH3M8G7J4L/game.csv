"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
