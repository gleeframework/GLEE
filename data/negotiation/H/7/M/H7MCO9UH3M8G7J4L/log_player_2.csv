Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and is offering a price higher than John's. It makes more sense to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
