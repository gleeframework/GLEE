"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints but $9,000 is too low for what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
