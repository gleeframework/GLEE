"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me, but still allows you a significant profit. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me as well.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000?  This price still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offer still gives you a good deal, and it's much closer to what I need.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",812500.0,Bob,6,
