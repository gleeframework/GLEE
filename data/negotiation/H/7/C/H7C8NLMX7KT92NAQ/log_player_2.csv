{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $150 is above your maximum budget of $120. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $150 but still within my budget. This aggressive counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice that I am serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her down closer to my target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good starting point.  I'm offering $125, which is halfway between her offer and my ideal price of $120. This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is only $10 less than John's price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might keep rejecting my offers. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better price, and it's not worth the time and effort if John is willing to sell for $120, which is within my budget."
