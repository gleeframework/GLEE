Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit significantly while reflecting the asset's worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice is well above her minimum.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to make the price more palatable to Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, giving her leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher. 
* **Relationship Importance:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly lower price might be strategic."
