"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $13,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
