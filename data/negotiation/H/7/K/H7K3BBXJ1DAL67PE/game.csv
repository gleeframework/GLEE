,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That way we both get a good deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,087,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
