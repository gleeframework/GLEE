Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to his maximum.
* **Appear Confident and Justify the Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces his perception and justifies the asking price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
