Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I can still get a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,350,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, it's a good deal for me considering the remaining rounds and the possibility of needing to sell to John for a lower price."
