"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save money.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has 9 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John's offer provides a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
