"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
