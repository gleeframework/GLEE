"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground at $900,000.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer to a deal, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
