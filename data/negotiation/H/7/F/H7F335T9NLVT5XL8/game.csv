"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand this is a valuable product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit below where I need to be.  How about $775,000? That's a fair middle ground, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  My final offer is $750,000.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
