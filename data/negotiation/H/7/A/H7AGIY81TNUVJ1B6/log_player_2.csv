"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll love owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, you know you have another option with John.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at the slightly higher price."
