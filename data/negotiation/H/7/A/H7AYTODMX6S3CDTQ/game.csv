"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a good starting point, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
