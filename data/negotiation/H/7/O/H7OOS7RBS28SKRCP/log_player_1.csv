Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a great value for the price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not stating this is my ""final offer"" so it leaves room for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Strategy:**  I'm starting high, but also acknowledging John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $20000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  Since I'm already at my minimum, there's no benefit to further negotiation.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal quickly without the risk of Bob walking away or me having to make further counteroffers.

**Overall:**  While I could try to negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely isn't worth it, given that this is my minimum."
