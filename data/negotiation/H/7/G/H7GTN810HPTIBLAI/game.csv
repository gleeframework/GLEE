"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. Given my understanding of the market and the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's unique value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1800000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
