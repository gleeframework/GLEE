"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me. 
* **Not a Huge Difference:** The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is only $5.  The risk of losing the deal for that small amount is not worth it at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** $92.50 is a fair price that is still above my minimum and leaves room for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than what I could get from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or the negotiation could stall, especially since we're already nearing the end of the allotted rounds.
* **Time is Money:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good deal quickly and move on to other opportunities."
