"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $12,000 offer allows for some give and take without significantly compromising my minimum desired price.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to me positions the offer as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open-ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation, as he's acknowledged the product's value to me. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a chance to make some profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  $10,250 is the midpoint between my desired price ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I emphasize that this offer is still beneficial to Bob, given the product's value, to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to respond and allows for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Needs to Continue:**  The offer is closer, but there's still room for compromise and further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and further increase the price.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to push the price closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. It's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above his last offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer and emphasize that it's a good deal for him. 
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** I'm highlighting the opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement and avoid selling to John. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and allows for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, our previous discussions, and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and we've only got 4 rounds left.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a price closer to $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, but there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  I'm taking a calculated risk to try and secure a higher offer.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground.  I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer to push the price up."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a great compromise for both of us.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a midpoint between Bob's last offer ($9,250) and my previous offer ($9,750). It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly highlighting the time constraint by emphasizing my desire to close the deal. This could create urgency for Bob.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""great compromise"" for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options. Selling to John for $15,000 is still a good option, but with only 3 rounds left, I might want to consider a final counteroffer that is slightly closer to Bob's price to try and close the deal."
