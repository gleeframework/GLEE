"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a significant discount from what the product is worth.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8500 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still limited by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant step for me. Let's close this deal and both of us walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,6,
