"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it gives us both some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not yet ready to settle for that price, and I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me right now. Let's split the difference â€“ $10,150. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is likely to be unproductive. John's offer provides me with a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
