"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it leaves a significant margin for negotiation. I'm willing to try and get a lower price, potentially closer to the $800,000 range.  Rejecting the offer allows me to initiate counteroffers and potentially secure a better deal."

This would still give you a good profit while allowing me a better deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the profit I'll make. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. While I want to avoid buying from John at $1,200,000, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900,000. It seems like we're both willing to compromise, so let's try to bridge the gap.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $925000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you and the profit I'll make. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000, which is a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or I'll end up buying from John at a much higher price.  This offer allows me to save $85,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
