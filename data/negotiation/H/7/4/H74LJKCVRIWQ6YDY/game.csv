"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This allows you a substantial profit margin while still offering me a fair deal. Consider this a chance to secure a key asset for your future success. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
