Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Strong Opening:** A strong opening offer can anchor the negotiation in your favor.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bolder negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a one-shot negotiation.  If there's an opportunity for counter-offers, the strategy might adjust to allow for a more dynamic approach."
