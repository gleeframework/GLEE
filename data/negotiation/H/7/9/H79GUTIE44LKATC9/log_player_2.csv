"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Even though Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal.  
* **Rejecting Alice's offer leads to a worse outcome:** Rejecting Alice's offer means buying from John at $1,200,000, which is more expensive.
* **Buying from John is the worst option:**  John's price is the highest, so buying from him is the least favorable option."
