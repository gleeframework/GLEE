"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a good starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's commitment to saving money. However, it's still a reasonable starting point for negotiations, leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer also emphasizes Bob's budget constraints, putting pressure on Alice to reconsider her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is substantial. I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue to push for a better price, potentially getting closer to his goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating his firmness while still showing a willingness to negotiate. The message emphasizes a fair price and reflects the product's value, subtly putting pressure on Alice to accept."
