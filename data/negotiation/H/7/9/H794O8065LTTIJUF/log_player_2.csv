I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This will give me a better understanding of her desired price range."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, I still believe we can negotiate further. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, so I need to find a solution that works for both of us."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire and Alice's offer is still too high. While I would prefer to get a better deal, I'm running out of time and risk losing the opportunity altogether. It's more prudent to buy from John for $1,000,000 rather than risk losing the product entirely."
