Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before listing it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $120, you can gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
