"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000.  It's a very valuable item, and I'm sure you'll find it quite beneficial. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $2,000,000 is a high starting point, it's still within a reasonable range for a product worth $1,500,000 to me.  I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Setting the Stage:** This first offer establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob is offering my minimum value for the product.  While this is a good outcome, I'm not under any pressure to settle immediately.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there is still potential to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push the price up. 

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, likely slightly above Bob's offer. I'll aim to find a price that's acceptable to me but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,500,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a slightly higher price for this unique product.  How about $1,750,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm starting my counter-offer slightly higher than Bob's offer to demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a better price.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my higher price, highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential. 
* **Balance:** $1,750,000 is a compromise between my initial ask and Bob's counter-offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  
* **Maintaining Interest:** I'm still expressing my desire to reach an agreement and close the deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:** Bob has lowered his offer further, which is not ideal, but still within the realm of possibilities.
* **Holding Out for More:** While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to counter and see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, likely aiming for a price between $1,400,000 and $1,750,000, with a focus on finding a price that is both acceptable to me and also has a good chance of being accepted by Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1550000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $1300000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's latest offer is significantly below my minimum value. This indicates that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further price reductions.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 6 of 10, leaving limited time to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  This ensures I secure a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
