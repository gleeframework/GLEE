"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, we can adjust from there."

I'm dropping the price to $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This should give Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being pushed too hard."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,050,000. This is still above my minimum and might be enough to close the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my final offer. It's my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept. If he doesn't, I'll move on to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still below my minimum value. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
