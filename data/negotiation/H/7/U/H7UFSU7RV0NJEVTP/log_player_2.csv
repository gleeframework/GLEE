Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1050000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.
