Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
