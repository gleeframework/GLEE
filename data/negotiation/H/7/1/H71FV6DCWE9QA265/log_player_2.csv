Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I'm extending an offer to sell it to you for $100. This price reflects its true value and the satisfaction it can bring to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You might be able to get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer, but there's no guarantee.  Buying from John ensures you get the product for your maximum price point."
