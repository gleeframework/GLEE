"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 was a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal! Alice is at her bottom line (she won't go lower than what the product is worth to her). Accepting this offer gets you the product for $200,000 less than its value to you and saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
