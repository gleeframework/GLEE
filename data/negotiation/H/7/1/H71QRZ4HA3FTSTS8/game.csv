"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1800000. It's a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $1500000 is still a bit low. I can offer you the product for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
