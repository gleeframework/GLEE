"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth a significant amount to me - at least $1200000. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person, and I think you might be that person. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000? ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
