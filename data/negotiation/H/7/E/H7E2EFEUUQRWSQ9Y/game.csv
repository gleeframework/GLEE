"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,800,000 for the product. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the intrinsic value of this product, especially tailored for your specific needs, is far greater.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's tailored value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the value you're adding. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
