"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price and still offers you a profit. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. It's a fair compromise that's closer to our target price, and we can both close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
