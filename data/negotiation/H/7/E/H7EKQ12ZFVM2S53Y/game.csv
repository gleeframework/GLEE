"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite low, though.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still only able to offer $13,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's make this work - $14,250 and it's yours.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit above my limit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,625?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",13625.0,Bob,6,
