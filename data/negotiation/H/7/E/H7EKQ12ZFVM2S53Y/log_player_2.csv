"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $18,000 when I know I can get the same product from John for $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate with Alice, but I'm ready to walk away and buy from John if the deal doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite low, though.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm determined to stay within my budget of $12,000 and will continue negotiating with Alice.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, and I have John as a backup if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still only able to offer $13,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's make this work - $14,250 and it's yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, $14,250 is still too high. I'm committed to getting the best deal possible and believe there's still room for further negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, but I'm prepared to buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit above my limit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,625?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13625}
