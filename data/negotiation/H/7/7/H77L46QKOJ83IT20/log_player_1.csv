``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting at a price that's higher than my minimum but still within a reasonable range.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob is offering my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to make more, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
