"Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price.  To be completely transparent, I can buy the product from another seller for $1,000,000.  So, I can't go any higher than that.  Is $1,000,000 something you would consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. Let me know if this is something you're interested in and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
