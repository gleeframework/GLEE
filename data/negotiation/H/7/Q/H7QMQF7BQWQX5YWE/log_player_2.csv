(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It makes sense to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. You can also use this opportunity to gauge how much Alice is willing to come down on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, and I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from Alice that's closer to my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. I can likely get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet her halfway. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not going to overpay. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer or at least come down further in her next counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $100,000 higher than my alternative option of buying from John. I want to see if I can get Alice down to $1,500,000 before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's my maximum price and matches what I can get from John.  Hopefully, Alice will accept and we can finalize the deal. If she rejects, I'll move on to John."
