"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,150,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,075,000 still falls short of my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000 to get this deal done. That's a firm offer, as I know I can always go with John if needed. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
