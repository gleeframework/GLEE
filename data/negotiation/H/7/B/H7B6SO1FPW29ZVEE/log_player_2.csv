"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really value.  It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $100.**
* **Your maximum value is $120.**
* **Your alternative is to buy from John for $120.**

Since Alice's offer is lower than your alternative, it's a better deal and you should accept it."
