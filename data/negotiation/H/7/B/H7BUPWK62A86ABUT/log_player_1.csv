"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he values the product at ($100).  It's unlikely he'll go any higher. I can sell it to John for the same price, eliminating any risk of not making a deal in the remaining rounds."
