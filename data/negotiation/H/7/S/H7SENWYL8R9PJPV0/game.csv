"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I'm not quite ready to pay $9000. I'd be willing to purchase it for $7500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is a compromise that still brings value to you while also being fair to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8250. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $8250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8350. This is my final compromise.",8350.0,Alice,5,
