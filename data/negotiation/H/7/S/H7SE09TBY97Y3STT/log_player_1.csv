Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already earning more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a $50,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential compromise.
* **It shows you're serious about selling to Bob:**  By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate with him.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to pay $950,000 for the product. Could we discuss a price closer to $700,000? I believe this would be more in line with what the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting his offer would mean losing money. 

While you could potentially negotiate with Bob further,  selling to John at $800,000 would be a safer and more profitable option.  However, it's worth exploring whether you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while remaining above your minimum price. 
* **Value proposition:** You are highlighting the discount from your initial offer to incentivize Bob. 
* **Clear next steps:**  You are inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and suggesting a potential middle ground.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also protecting your financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $850,000 is quite high for the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. This is a price that aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of prolonging the process.

Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.  It's a more secure and efficient decision."
