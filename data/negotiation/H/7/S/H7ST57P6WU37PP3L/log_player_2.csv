"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $10,000. It's too close to Alice's valuation and leaves little room for negotiation.  Let's send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to maximize savings, so we're aiming closer to our $8,000 walk-away price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This offer gives Alice the opportunity to counter and potentially meet us somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we can still try to push for a better deal. She's acknowledging the product's value to us, which is a good sign. Let's counter with a price closer to our limit to see if she'll budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Position:** We're proposing a price directly between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($6,500). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Near Walk-Away Point:**  This offer is close to our $8,000 walk-away price, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We're keeping the tone collaborative and suggesting a ""fair compromise"" to encourage agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This price would be fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a good value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our walk-away price of $8,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as we won't get a better deal."
