``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This price would be fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a good value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
