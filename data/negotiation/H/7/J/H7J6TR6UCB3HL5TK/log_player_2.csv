"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $7,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both parties. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, but he's also aware that she's motivated to sell. A $7,000 offer is a significant discount from the original asking price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer also leaves room for further bargaining if Alice wants to get closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting this offer secures a good deal.  At $7,250, Bob saves $750 compared to buying from John, and it's only $250 more than his initial counteroffer.  It's a good compromise that minimizes risk and achieves a significant saving."
