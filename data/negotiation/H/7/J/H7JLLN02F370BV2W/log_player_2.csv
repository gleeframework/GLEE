"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $11,000 to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's minimum value as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Offering $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum. This creates a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than $10,500. How about $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. Bob should continue to negotiate. He's already established that he's willing to pay more than Alice's minimum, but he can likely get a better price than $11,200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,800? It's a fair middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to stay within his budget while still offering a price that is reasonable to Alice. He's showing a willingness to negotiate and has proposed a price that is closer to Alice's last offer.  This should hopefully lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best deal Bob has received so far, and it's within his budget.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge or that the negotiation will drag on, potentially leading to a deal with John at $12,000. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for Bob while minimizing risk."
