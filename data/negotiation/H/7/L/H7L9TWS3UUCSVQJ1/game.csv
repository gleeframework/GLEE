"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $2,000,000, so how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
