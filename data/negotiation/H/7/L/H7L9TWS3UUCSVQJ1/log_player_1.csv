"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" and the ""significant return on investment,"" I am framing the product's worth in a way that might justify the high initial price to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps me gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above his actual valuation of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to go lower, but not to $1,800,000 yet. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal while still acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's price range. 
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's ""true worth"" to subtly push back on Bob's lower valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By proposing $2,000,000, I'm aiming to create a negotiation space where a final agreement is likely to be above $1,800,000 and hopefully closer to $1,900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $2,000,000, so how about $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above Bob's actual valuation and a strong return on the product for me.
* **Negotiation Skill:** Bob meeting me exactly in the middle suggests this is likely his ceiling price. 
* **Time Value:**  While I could push for more in further rounds, there's no guarantee I'd secure a significantly better deal. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me being forced to take John's offer later."
