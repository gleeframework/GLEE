**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a number acceptable to Alice within the remaining rounds.  It's more profitable for Alice to cut her losses now and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
