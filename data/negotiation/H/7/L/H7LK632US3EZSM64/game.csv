I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you be willing to do $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. Can you do that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $110 is still a little too much for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $100.  It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
