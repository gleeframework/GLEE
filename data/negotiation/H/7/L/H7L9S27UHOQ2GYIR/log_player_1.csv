This offer starts the negotiation with a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $1,200,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what I'd get from John, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers and settle on $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering and it's closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid further negotiation and secure a good profit."
