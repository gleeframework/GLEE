"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $1,200,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers and settle on $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
