"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500, considering the value it holds for you. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's see if we can meet at $13,750.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but that's my limit.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $13,375. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",13375.0,Alice,7,
