"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000.  It's not even close. You'll need to counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your absolute maximum price. You're going straight for the jugular here. You know the product is worth $800,000 to you, and you're hoping Alice is desperate enough to take that offer. If she rejects, you can still buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. Alice is clearly trying to squeeze as much money out of you as possible. We can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're going to start splitting the difference. Alice's offer was $1,000,000 and our maximum is $800,000.  We'll offer $900,000, which is a good compromise. This also keeps us a bit closer to our ideal price point.  If she rejects, we can always buy from John."
