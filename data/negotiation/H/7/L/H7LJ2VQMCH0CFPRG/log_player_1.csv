"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as selling to John would net me the same amount.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to come up a bit, but if not, I'm prepared to walk away and deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's only $100,000 less than what I could get from John.  I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid further negotiations and potentially losing the sale altogether."
