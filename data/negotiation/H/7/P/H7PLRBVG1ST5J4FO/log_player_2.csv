You should reject Alice's offer.  It's far too high for your budget. You'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, given the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

While $120 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offers, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You're better off buying from John at $80 to ensure you stay within your budget."
