Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a good compromise, hopefully securing a price that's closer to my desired $1,500,000.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, even though it's higher than his initial willingness to pay.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still a significant amount higher than what he originally wanted to pay, but it's a compromise closer to his offer. I hope this encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still too low.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a little closer to his offer, but still higher. If he rejects this, I will sell to John."
