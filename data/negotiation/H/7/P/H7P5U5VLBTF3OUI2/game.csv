"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're firm on your price, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500?",862500.0,Bob,6,
