"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John."
