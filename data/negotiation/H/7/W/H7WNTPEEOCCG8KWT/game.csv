"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
