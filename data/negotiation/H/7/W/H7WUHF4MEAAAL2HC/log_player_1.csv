Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic, and it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's more than what I would get from John.  It's best to close the deal now."
