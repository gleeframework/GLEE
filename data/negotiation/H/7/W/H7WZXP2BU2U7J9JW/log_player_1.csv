Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum value of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for both of you to compromise and find a price that works. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $9,500.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price,  it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether and having to settle for John's $8,000 offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
