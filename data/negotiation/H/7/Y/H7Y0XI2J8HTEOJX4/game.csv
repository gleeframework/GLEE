"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $11,500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, but that's my final offer. This is the best price I can do.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,800 is really pushing my limit. I'm willing to do $12,000, but if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
