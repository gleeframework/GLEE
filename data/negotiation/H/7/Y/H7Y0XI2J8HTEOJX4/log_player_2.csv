"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than it is to her own valuation.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to the middle ground, $13,000 is still a bit high. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer a bit closer to her price, but still aiming to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to signal that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still aiming for a price below $12,000 (her value). This offer represents a significant saving for me while potentially being acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $11,500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, but that's my final offer. This is the best price I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm, but the price is still too close to my starting budget.  She's signaled this is her ""best and final"" but I'll try one more time to see if there's any wiggle room. I need to convey that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,800 is really pushing my limit. I'm willing to do $12,000, but if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider John's offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my guns at $12,000, which is her valuation, so it's fair.
* **Introducing John:**  Mentioning John's offer reminds Alice that I have another option if she's not willing to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrasing it as my last offer adds a bit of pressure for her to make a decision this round."
