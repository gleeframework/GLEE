Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This gives you significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Targeting Above Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (from John).  You should aim significantly higher when negotiating with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high asking price."
