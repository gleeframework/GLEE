"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,750,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,550,000. This reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close to a price I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
