Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
