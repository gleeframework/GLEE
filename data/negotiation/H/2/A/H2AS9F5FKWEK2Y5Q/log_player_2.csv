"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a game-changer and we believe it's worth every penny. Considering its immense value to you, I propose a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're looking to save as much as possible, and her initial offer is already above your ideal price.  It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her perceived value. This signals my willingness to negotiate and leaves room for a compromise.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to both of us, suggesting that my offer is fair given the potential benefits.
* **Negotiation Room:**  By starting at $1,050,000, I leave room for Alice to counter and hopefully settle on a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to jump at this offer just yet.  I'll counter again with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,100,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go to $1,075,000. This shows my commitment to this deal and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering to split the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,080,000? This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider $1,085,000 as a final price for the product.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,085,000, which is only $5,000 above my last counteroffer of $1,080,000.  It's within my budget and a reasonable price, especially considering the risk of going to John and paying $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
