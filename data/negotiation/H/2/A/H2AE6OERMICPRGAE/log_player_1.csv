Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150 if he counters. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your chances of earning a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is what I believe it's worth to me. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can likely do better. You have already established a higher value for the product in the previous round, and rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By showing you're not desperate for a quick sale, you can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **See if Bob is willing to compromise:**  He might be willing to increase his offer slightly if he realizes you're not going to accept his initial price. 

Selling to John right now would result in the same profit as accepting Bob's offer, but rejecting the offer provides an opportunity to potentially earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're willing to pay $100, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price of $125. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not settling for his initial price and showing you are willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** You're demonstrating flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Fairly split:** The middle ground is a good starting point for reaching a mutually acceptable price. 

By making this counteroffer, you are giving Bob a chance to  adjust his price upwards, while still maintaining a profitable margin for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still committed to staying within my budget. I'd like to stick to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he is not willing to budge from his $100 offer.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that you could spend more time and energy trying to get a higher price, and ultimately end up with the same $100 profit. 

Selling to John for $100 guarantees you a quick and certain profit.  It's time to cut your losses and move on."
