"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique potential and value"" provides a vague but positive rationale for the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording emphasizes that this is a ""starting point"" and you're open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're more likely to negotiate a higher final price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His counteroffer will reveal how serious he is and how much he values the product.
3. **Maintain Control:**  You set the tone for the negotiation from the outset."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  your initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $800,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his counteroffer was expected given the high anchor, accepting now would mean a substantial loss.  You have plenty of room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John, so there's no need to settle at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Moving down $400,000 from your initial offer signals a willingness to negotiate but avoids appearing desperate. 
* **Reaffirming Value:**  You're still positioning the product's worth above Bob's offer, reinforcing its desirability.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to your acceptable range while leaving room for further negotiation. 

This strategy maintains a strong position while encouraging Bob to engage more seriously in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend on this product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price. While he claims this is his ""final offer,"" it's likely a negotiation tactic. You have the security of John's offer, so you can afford to continue negotiating.  Walking away now might prompt Bob to reconsider his stance, especially if he believes he's losing the opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm also confident in the value this product represents. $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect that, and I wouldn't be doing right by myself accepting it. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value our discussions and would prefer to work something out with you.  My final offer is $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair offer for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning another buyer (""John"" but without specifics) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity without revealing your hand completely.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as your ""final offer,"" you signal a limit to your flexibility.
* **Justification and Compromise:** You're still emphasizing the value while acknowledging Bob's position and highlighting your compromise. 

This approach aims to:

1.  **Motivate Bob to Act:** He might be more willing to negotiate further knowing there's potential competition.
2. **Maintain Value Perception:**  You're not drastically dropping the price, showing you believe in the product's worth.
3. **Set a Clear Bottom Line:** Bob understands that $1,700,000 is likely the best he'll get."
