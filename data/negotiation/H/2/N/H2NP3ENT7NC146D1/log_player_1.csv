"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I hope you'll consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too low for me, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's true value. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between our interests."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge in the next round."
