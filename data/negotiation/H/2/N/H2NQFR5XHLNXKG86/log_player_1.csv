Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, even without specifics.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,500,000, there's room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims for the best possible outcome. However, it's crucial to be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price if he's resistant to the initial offer."
