"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line. This still gives you a significant profit margin. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $950,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for a higher price."
