Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 again, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

I've reached a point where the negotiation isn't moving towards my target price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  selling to John for $8,000 is still within my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a sale."
