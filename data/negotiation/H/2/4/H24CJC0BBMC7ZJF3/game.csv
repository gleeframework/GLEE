"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do.",10500.0,Alice,5,
