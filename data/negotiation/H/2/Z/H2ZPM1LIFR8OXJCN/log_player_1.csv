Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also offers a significant profit for you, as it's higher than your minimum threshold of $15,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** This strategy aims to secure a price closer to your desired value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, it opens up space for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  By keeping John as a backup option, you're in a strong position to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. Selling to John for $15,000 is the more profitable option at this point. However, I will explore if I can get closer to my target value with a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but emphasize that this counteroffer is a fair compromise. I also highlight the benefits of the deal for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:**  $10,500 is a significant improvement over Bob's offer and allows me to secure a more substantial profit than selling to John.
* **Signaling Flexibility:** By lowering my price from $12,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and make a deal.
* **Avoiding a Deal Breaker:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as refusing it might lead him to walk away.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider if my desired price is achievable or if I should sell to John to secure the guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000. At this point, the risk of further negotiations with Bob failing is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me a substantial profit and eliminates the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob."
