{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than what you're willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob, which could encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to go up to $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is closer to your minimum acceptable price than $8,000, it's still a good deal for you as it's above your minimum.  Furthermore, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept your next counteroffer, and you risk losing him as a buyer.  It's a good idea to secure a sale now, rather than risk further negotiation."
