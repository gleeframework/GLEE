"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, given its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, but I think it's still a great value for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
