{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not high enough, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price or further delays. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
