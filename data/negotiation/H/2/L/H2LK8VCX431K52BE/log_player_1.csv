Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. This price also maximizes your profit compared to selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay above your minimum. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about Bob could lead to an even better offer."
