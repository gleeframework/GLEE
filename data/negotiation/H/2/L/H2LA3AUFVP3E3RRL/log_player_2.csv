"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, and I believe it's also a great value for you since it's worth $150 to you. Let's make this deal work for both of us. How about we start at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate downwards and should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much room for negotiation exists. 
* **Justification:** While not revealing our absolute maximum, we're implying our budget is tighter by offering $110. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  We maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product to you for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down from $140 to $125, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  The current offer is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $120. 
* **Alternative:** We're still better off than buying from John at $150. We have some leverage to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to the midpoint between our previous offer ($110) and Alice's offer ($125).
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** $117 is a reasonable price that gives Alice a profit while still saving us money compared to John's offer. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  We continue to be polite and collaborative, fostering a good negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your suggestion, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we settle on $122 for the transaction? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is likely reaching her lower limit. The potential savings from here on out are getting smaller.
* **Acceptable Price:** $122 is a reasonable price, giving Alice a small profit and saving us $28 compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Value:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and ensures we get the product."
