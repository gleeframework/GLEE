Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is well within your budget. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the price increasing further in later rounds."
