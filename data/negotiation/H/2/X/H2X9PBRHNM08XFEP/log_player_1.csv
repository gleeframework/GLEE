"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob of getting the product for less than its perceived worth.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Keeping the option open:** I'm mindful that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a higher price and try to find a compromise.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, I prefer to try and get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing the potential savings. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm using language that suggests I'm willing to negotiate further, inviting Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to $8,500. 
* **Maintaining my position:** I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price yet, but I'm showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $9,000?  This is a fair price that's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm staying above my minimum price but showing I'm willing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that he's still getting a good deal at $9,000.
* **Encouraging a deal:** I'm using language that suggests I'm ready to close the deal at $9,000.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to move on to John."
