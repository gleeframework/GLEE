"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and what it can do for you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects its high quality and the significant impact it can have on your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is less than the price from John, there's room to negotiate a better price.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so a price closer to that range is possible. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to secure a better deal."
