"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's benefits.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price reflects its worth and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To further accommodate your budget while still valuing the product's true worth, I am proposing a price of $9,000 for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering your budget constraints and the product's value, I propose a price of $8,875 for the product. This price is slightly above your initial offer but below mine, aiming to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction.",8875.0,Alice,5,
