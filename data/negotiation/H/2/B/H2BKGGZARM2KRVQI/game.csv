"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a little high for my budget though. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is very close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's the best I can do.",950000.0,Bob,6,
