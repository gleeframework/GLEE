"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation to save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $900,000. This is still a significant gain for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While $900,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to drive the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $887,500. This is still a good price for me, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $887,500, Bob is getting a good deal, saving over $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be a tiny bit more room to negotiate, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential small savings."
