"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to do $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $160 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $155? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
