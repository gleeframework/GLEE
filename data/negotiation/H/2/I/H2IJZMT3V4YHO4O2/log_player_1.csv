Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to do $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $160 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $155? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum price of $150. While I'd prefer more, it's a good compromise and ensures a sale."
