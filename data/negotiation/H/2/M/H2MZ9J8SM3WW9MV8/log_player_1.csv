Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $850,000 at this point. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it would be above your cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
