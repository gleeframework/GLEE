"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $850,000 at this point. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it would be above your cost.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still above what I can realistically afford right now.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a good compromise for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. Let's close this deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
