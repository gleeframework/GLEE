"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  I need to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $850,000 at this point. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it would be above your cost."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, though it's a step in the right direction. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There's still a good chance I can get closer to my target without having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still above what I can realistically afford right now.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  I want to see if I can get a little bit lower before considering buying from John.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a good compromise for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but she's not budging much.  While $920,000 is closer to my target than her previous offer, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  Buying from John guarantees me the product for my maximum budget, and I don't want to risk wasting more time trying to get a better price from Alice."
