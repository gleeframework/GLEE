Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your potential gain. Here's the approach:

1. **Start High, But Reasonable:** Don't start at $1,499,999. It might make Bob feel like you're not willing to negotiate. Instead, start slightly below John's offer to show some flexibility.
2. **Highlight Value:**  Without revealing John's offer, subtly imply the product's high demand.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with other interested parties. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting within the ZOPA but leaving yourself room to negotiate if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency without revealing John's specific offer.
* **Focus on Value:** By emphasizing the ""unique value"" and ""high demand,"" you're reminding Bob of the product's potential. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Remember, your absolute minimum is $1,500,000."
