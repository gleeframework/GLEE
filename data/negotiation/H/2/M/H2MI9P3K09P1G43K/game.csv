,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This would give us both a good deal, let's try to work something out.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,075,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,087,500 is close, but I'm still pushing for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,062,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
