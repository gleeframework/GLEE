"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1400000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1550000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
