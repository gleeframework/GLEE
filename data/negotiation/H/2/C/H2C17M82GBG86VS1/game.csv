"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too much. Let's go with $9,750. It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,
