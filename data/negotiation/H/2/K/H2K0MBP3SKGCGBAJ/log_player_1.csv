Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that he can get a good deal.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Plan B is still available:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's a midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Attractive Deal:**  $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Getting Closer:** This counteroffer moves us closer to my desired price without alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Further negotiation needed:** I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.
* **Plan B is still a good option:**  If negotiations break down, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise that's a bit closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Show of Good Faith:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While this price is lower than I'd like, it's still a good deal for me, and it's a better option than selling to John right now.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take a lot of time and effort, which could be better spent pursuing other opportunities or finding new buyers. 
* **Plan B is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and provides a more certain outcome compared to continued negotiation with Bob. 

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, the potential for a better outcome with Bob is diminishing, and the certainty of John's offer is too valuable to ignore."
