"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the next counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's current offer is the most logical choice to secure a good deal and avoid further negotiation risk."
