"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet at $1,025,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value and the fact that we're already nearing a deal.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come closer to my asking price.  $1,012,500 is a strong offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a slightly higher figure. How about $1,018,750? This is a small compromise on my part, and it would make this a very successful deal for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",1018750.0,Alice,7,
