"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I can do a bit better than $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make it work for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I do think this product is worth negotiating for.  While $1,080,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to land closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,065,000?",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,070,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
