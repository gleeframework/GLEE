"Hi Alice,  $250 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit too high.  I'm firm on $100.  It's my absolute max. Let me know if you're willing to do that, otherwise I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $125 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to buy right now for $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to buy from someone else.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to walking away, and I don't want to lose the sale. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm sticking to my offer of $100. It's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you'll accept it, otherwise I'm going to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really firm on $100, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's going to be my final offer. I'll sell it to you for $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to sell it to John for $150.",110.0,Alice,9,
