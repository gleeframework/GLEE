"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial starting point.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I think this price reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? It's closer to the middle ground, and I believe it reflects the product's true value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
