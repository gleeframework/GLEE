Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
