Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, a price that still allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, a price that still provides you with a solid return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Let's find a solution that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950,000 is still a significant gap from what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price point allows for a healthy return on your investment while ensuring I can achieve a fair value for the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer.  While $980,000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,015,000.  This price point allows for both of us to make a solid profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.
