"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to maximize his savings.  Offering $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential negotiation. This price is also well below Bob's maximum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for counter-negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  While still below Bob's maximum acceptable price, it doesn't represent a significant enough concession from Alice.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer.  $875,000 is a modest increase from his previous offer, signaling his willingness to negotiate but not cave to Alice's demands. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer and below Bob's maximum acceptable price, keeping a healthy margin for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. Bob can still potentially get a lower price, and there are only a few rounds left before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer, but still aiming for a better deal.  $900,000 represents a significant increase from his previous offer but is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows his willingness to compromise while trying to maximize his savings. With only a few rounds left, he needs to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum acceptable price, but it's still too high.  There's still a chance to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a couple more rounds to try to secure a lower price.  With only three rounds left, Bob should be more aggressive in his counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum acceptable price, but still aiming for a better deal.  He's increasing his offer to show a willingness to compromise. This price is still below Alice's current offer, and with only two rounds remaining, it's a strong attempt to find a middle ground. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob may need to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's maximum acceptable price.  With only one round left, it's unlikely that Alice will offer a price that is significantly lower.  It's better for Bob to buy from John at his maximum price of $1,200,000 than to risk getting a worse deal with Alice."
