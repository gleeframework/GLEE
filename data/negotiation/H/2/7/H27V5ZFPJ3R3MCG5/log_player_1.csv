Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for even slightly less would still be more profitable.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $11,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down closer to $10,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the price without trying to negotiate too aggressively.
* **Justification for Price:**  While not explicitly stating your minimum, framing it as a ""special price"" implies that Bob is getting a deal, which might make him more receptive. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing your potential profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough that he might accept."
