I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it's not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000 or more.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is very stubborn and refuses to budge on my minimum price. While his offer of $11,500 is close, I am not willing to risk him refusing again and leaving me with nothing.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option for me at this point."
