"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider meeting me halfway and offering $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $11000. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my own budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
