"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
