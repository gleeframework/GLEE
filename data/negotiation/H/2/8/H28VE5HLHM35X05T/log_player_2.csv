"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and what it can do for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Buying from John will save Bob $500."
