"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first for a price of $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, so I'm confident this is a fair price given its potential. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1350000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's a price I'm willing to consider. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1300000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet at $1325000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,
