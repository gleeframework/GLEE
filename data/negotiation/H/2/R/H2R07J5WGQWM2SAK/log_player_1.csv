"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, given its potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
