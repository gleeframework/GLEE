"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I believe in the product's value, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $1,400,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and to meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my absolute top end is $1,450,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
