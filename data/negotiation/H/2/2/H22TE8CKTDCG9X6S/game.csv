"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $980,000 for it. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my original price, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $980,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm willing to make a deal.",980000.0,Alice,5,
