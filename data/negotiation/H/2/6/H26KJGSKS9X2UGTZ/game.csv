"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking $220 for it. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $220 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could you do $180? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $180 is still too much for me. How about $120?  That's a fair compromise and lets us both get what we want.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product.  How about $160, and we call it a deal?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $130. This is the absolute most I can afford right now. Let's try to come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
