"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Can you consider $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $108?  That's a compromise that's fair to both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",106.0,Bob,6,
