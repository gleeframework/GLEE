Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'd need the price to be significantly lower. How about we start at $600,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider a price closer to $800,000? I'm thinking $700,000 might work.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  Honestly, $1,100,000 is pushing me towards exploring other options, and I have a reliable offer for $800,000. If you can come down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $850,000 offer. He has a backup plan and is using it as leverage. While $850,000 is a decent sum, accepting it would mean losing out on a guaranteed $650,000 from John. The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward at this point."
