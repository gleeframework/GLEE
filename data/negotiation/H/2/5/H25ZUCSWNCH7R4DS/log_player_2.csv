"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'd need the price to be significantly lower. How about we start at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still within the realm of possibility for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a lower number, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Alice to counter, signaling that we're serious about finding an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum. There's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider a price closer to $800,000? I'm thinking $700,000 might work."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Strategic:** $700,000 is still a significant saving from Alice's last offer and keeps us within a reasonable range of our $800,000 alternative.
* **Signaling Limits:** By mentioning $800,000, we're subtly indicating our upper limit without revealing our absolute maximum. This might encourage Alice to make a more aggressive move if she's truly interested in selling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle at $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but Not Enough:** Alice is moving closer to your range, but $1,100,000 is still a long way from your $800,000 alternative with John. 
* **Leverage:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell. You haven't agreed to any price she's suggested, so she might be willing to go even lower.  

**It's time to play a bit of hardball.  The next counteroffer should signal that you're seriously considering John's offer if Alice doesn't budge significantly.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  Honestly, $1,100,000 is pushing me towards exploring other options, and I have a reliable offer for $800,000. If you can come down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider the other offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** This message clearly states your position and the urgency of the situation. 
* **Revealing Alternatives (Partially):** By mentioning the $800,000 offer, you add weight to your position without fully revealing your walk-away price.
* **Final Offer (Implied):**  The tone suggests that $850,000 is your best and final offer. This puts the ball firmly in Alice's court.

This strategy aims to get Alice to significantly lower her price, knowing that she might lose the sale if she doesn't."
