Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  How about $140?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** If Bob declines, you have a guaranteed $100 from John.

By starting at $140, you're aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while leaving room for negotiation if needed. You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept."
