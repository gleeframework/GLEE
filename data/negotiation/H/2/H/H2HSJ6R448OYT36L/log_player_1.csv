Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation of $120, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and we'll see how the negotiation progresses from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested but would need to come in at $85 to make it work for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum of $80, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $95? That leaves some room for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
