"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120), but you can potentially get a better deal.**  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get the price lower. 
* **There's no immediate urgency.** You have the option to buy from John, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested but would need to come in at $85 to make it work for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $95? That leaves some room for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a reasonable compromise.** She's moved closer to your desired price, and you're still saving money compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If you reject, you might get a lower price, but you also risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away.
* **It's a good deal within your budget.**  $95 is still under your $120 limit, and you've achieved a significant discount from the initial offer."
