"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
