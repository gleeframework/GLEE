{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $9,000. I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000. Let's try $10000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $10,000 is still above his target. He should try one more counteroffer to see if he can push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can only offer $9,500. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm truly hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $12000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob. He's already made multiple counteroffers and reached his maximum budget. At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't going to come down to his desired price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John for $8,000."
