"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product name] for a price that will allow you to generate significant value. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than your maximum budget.
* You know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her.  There's a chance she'll come down closer to her $800,000 value to avoid losing the sale. 

**Strategy:**  It's always best to leave room for negotiation, especially since you have a backup option with John."
