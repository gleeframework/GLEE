,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
