"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you won't regret it.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while giving you a significant advantage.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
