"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. My budget remains firm at $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
