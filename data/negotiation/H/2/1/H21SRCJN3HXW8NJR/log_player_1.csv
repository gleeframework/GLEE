Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""special introductory price,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency and value. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response (accept, reject, counter) will reveal how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
2. **Maximize Profit:**  There's a chance Bob accepts the initial high price. If not, I can gradually lower it during negotiation, ensuring I don't go below my minimum.
3. **John as Backup:** I have the security of John's offer ($150), allowing me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value and well below my minimum. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.  I'll counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", 
""product_price"": 170
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but Above Minimum):**  I'm showing flexibility by moving down from my initial price. However, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  I'm not providing a specific reason for the price, which keeps the negotiation open.  

This strategy aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will reveal if he's willing to negotiate above his initial offer. 
2. **Maintain Profit Margin:** I'm still aiming for a price that yields a good profit.
3. **Option to Walk Away:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob isn't willing to move significantly, I'll take the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $170 is still a bit much for me. Could you do $120?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more flexibility, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make one more attempt to bridge the gap, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120.  My final offer is $145.  I think that's a very fair price for this product."", 
""product_price"": 145
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Above Minimum):** This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. The price is still above my minimum, but it leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Firm Language:** Using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""very fair price"" signals that I'm serious about this being my limit. 

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I secure a sale at a price above my minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $150. 

By now, Bob should understand that I'm willing to walk away. This final offer puts the decision firmly in his hands."
