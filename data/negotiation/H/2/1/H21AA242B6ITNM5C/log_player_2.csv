"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its value could be significantly higher for the right buyer. I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000. This is a one-time offer and I'm confident you won't find this kind of value elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to convince Bob that the product is worth more than $1,500,000, but there's no concrete evidence to support this claim.  Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $500,000."
