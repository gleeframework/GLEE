"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it represents a great value for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in negotiating.  However, $11,250 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit worried about hitting my target price. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $11,500?
