"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a lower price than my target ($10,000) gives me some wiggle room to negotiate. It shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also have limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still higher than my target price of $10,000.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident $10,000 is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm sticking to my target price of $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid losing the deal altogether."
