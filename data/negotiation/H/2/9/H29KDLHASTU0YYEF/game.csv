"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This offer is a good compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? This would be my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
