Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it also ensures I get a profit above my minimum value. I'm confident I can get at least $12,000 from John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  $9,000 is below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product for $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still within a range that gives me some profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still above my minimum value and a decent profit.  It's not worth risking losing a sale and getting only $12,000 from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
