Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. It's a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's uniqueness and worth. What do you think?

While $1,400,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your preferred price point.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's safer to go with the known, lower price."
