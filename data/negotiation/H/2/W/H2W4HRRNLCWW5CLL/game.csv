"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $130. This is a good middle ground that I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $95.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on this item.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $110. This is a good compromise that I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
