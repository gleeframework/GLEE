"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no point in accepting Alice's offer of $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's significantly lower than the $12,000 you'd pay John.  Accepting this offer saves you $1,750 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sound decision at this point."
