"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250 yet. I'll compromise at $12,000, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you at $11,500, which is closer to the middle ground we're looking for. This would be a fair deal for both of us and could help us finalize the purchase. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, which is just $50 above your latest offer. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,7,
