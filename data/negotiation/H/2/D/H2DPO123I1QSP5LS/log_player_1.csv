Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

I'm still not willing to sell for $1,100,000. I think I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
