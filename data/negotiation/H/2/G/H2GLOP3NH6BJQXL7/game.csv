"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I've had a lot of interest in, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm thinking of starting at $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Could you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique item.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting into the final stretch, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I need to make it clear that this is my absolute lowest price. I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're serious about the product, this is your last chance to make it happen.",9000.0,Alice,7,
