"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $12,000.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see you're serious about this product.  To be honest, taking anything less than $15,000 would be really difficult for me. How about we settle at $14,000 and we have a deal?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the $15,000.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we make it a $13,000 deal, and we can both walk away happy?",13000.0,Bob,6,
