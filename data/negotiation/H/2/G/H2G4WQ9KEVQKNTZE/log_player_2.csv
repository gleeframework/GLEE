"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $10,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal.  He'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? That's a fair price for the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is within his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal. He should try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8,250? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
