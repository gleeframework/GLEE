"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000, reflecting the value I see in this product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
