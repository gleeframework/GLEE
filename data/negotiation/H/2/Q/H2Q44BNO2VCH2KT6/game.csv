"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, given the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's worth a lot to you, Alice, and I am trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but unfortunately, $9,750 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is a final offer on my end, and it's a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
