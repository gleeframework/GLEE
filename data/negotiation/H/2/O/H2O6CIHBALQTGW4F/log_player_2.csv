(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $11,000. This is still above her value for the product ($10,000), giving her some room to negotiate.  It's also within my budget, and significantly lower than her initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate."

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500.  This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal. It's also still within my budget and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to accept since it's only $1,500 above my max, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John to avoid further delays and ensure I get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and it's still $500 below Alice's last offer.  If she rejects this, I'll move on to John.  This demonstrates my commitment to the deal, while also pushing for a price that's as close to my budget as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge significantly.  To avoid getting stuck in an endless negotiation loop and to ensure I get the product within my budget, I will purchase from John at $12,000."
