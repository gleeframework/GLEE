"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and it's better to secure the product at the known $1,500,000 price from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
