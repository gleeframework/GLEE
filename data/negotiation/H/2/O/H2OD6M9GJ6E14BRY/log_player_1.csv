Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I still have time to negotiate with Bob or sell to John, so I'm not going to settle for that low of an offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value for you. I can move my offer up slightly to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his previous offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
