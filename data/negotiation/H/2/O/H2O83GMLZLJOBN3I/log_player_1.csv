Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's worth a lot to you. How does $115 sound?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible without scaring him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher gives some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **""First Dibs"" Appeal:** Emphasizing that this is an exclusive offer might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, we increase the likelihood of a sale while still aiming for a price significantly higher than our guaranteed $100 from John."
