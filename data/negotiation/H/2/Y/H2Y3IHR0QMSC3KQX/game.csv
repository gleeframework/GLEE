"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you consider $12,500?  This would still give you a good profit and leave me with some wiggle room.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,200, which is still a great deal for you and a good profit for me. Let me know if this works for you!",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $12,500. How about $12,800? It's a fair price for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,800. I'm willing to meet you at $13,400, which is still a good deal for you and a decent profit for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",13400.0,Alice,5,
