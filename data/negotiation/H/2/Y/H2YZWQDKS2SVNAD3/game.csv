"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price that allows me to get closer to my desired price and still offers you a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to my desired price, but $8,800 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $9,200.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,100? This is the best I can offer, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.  What do you say?",9100.0,Alice,7,
