"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you need to spend. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for you to buy from John and save $250,000."
