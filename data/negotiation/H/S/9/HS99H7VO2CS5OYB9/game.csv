"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that. I'm confident it would be a great investment for your company.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
