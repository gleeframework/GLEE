"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that. I'm confident it would be a great investment for your company.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $900,000, but I can get the same product from John for $800,000. That's a $100,000 savings.
