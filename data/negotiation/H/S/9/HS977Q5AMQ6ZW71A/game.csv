"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
