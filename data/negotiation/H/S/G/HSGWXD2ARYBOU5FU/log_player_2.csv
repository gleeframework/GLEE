Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal by buying from John for $800,000. He can try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge, but if she rejects it, he should buy from John."

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still too high, and he can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price of $800,000. It's better to save the extra money and go with the more affordable option."
