"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. We're willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is closer to your maximum budget than to Alice's minimum.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation since the product is worth less to Alice than your maximum.

**Strategy:** 
By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum value, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Clear message:** The message states Bob's interest in the product while expressing his financial limitations and a desire to negotiate. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $850,000 is still closer to your maximum budget than to Alice's minimum. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  There's still potential for a better price. 

**Strategy:** 
Continuing to reject offers and counter-propose is the best strategy at this point.  The goal is to continue driving the price down, getting closer to Alice's minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm ready to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering your minimum value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is exactly at Alice's minimum value, showing Bob's understanding of the negotiation and willingness to meet her minimum.
* **Urgency:** The message adds a sense of urgency to push Alice to accept the offer, emphasizing that this is a fair price for both parties.
* **Strategic approach:** This counteroffer creates a situation where Alice has to decide whether to accept the offer or risk losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob can still continue to negotiate, but it's important to stay firm and avoid going too much higher than $800,000.  If Alice remains unwilling to accept a price closer to her minimum, Bob should consider his alternatives, including purchasing from John."
