"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
