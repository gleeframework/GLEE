{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the value proposition, not just the price. 
* **Strategic thinking:** By offering $100 initially, I'm aiming to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
    * Potentially close the deal at a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
    * If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my willingness to continue negotiating.

**Important Note:** The optimal strategy depends on factors like your risk tolerance, how urgently you need to sell the product, and how much you believe Bob values the product. This is just one possible starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $80?  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $80. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and don't lose the opportunity to potentially secure a better deal. 

**Next Step:** I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows good faith and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit:** This price ($95) is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I wouldn't be losing money on the deal.
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Pressure to close:** By offering a compromise and emphasizing the fairness of the price, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept and close the deal.

**Strategic thinking:** 

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I can further adjust my price based on his next counteroffer. However, I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable price and the risk of negotiating too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still just a little over my budget. I'm willing to go to $85, and that's really the very best I can do. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has raised his offer, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **John's offer is significantly better:** John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer and meets my minimum requirement.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks prolonging the process and ultimately resulting in a lower price. 

**Strategic Choice:** By selling to John, I guarantee a profitable outcome and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob."
