"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you showing me this product. However, $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $180. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $180 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product at that price. What do you say?",150.0,Bob,4,
