"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $800,000 is a good price, but there's room to negotiate and potentially get it even lower.  It's worth exploring those options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's 25% lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong negotiation position and encourages Alice to compromise.  I'm still within my budget, but I'm aiming to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I have more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring options and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a substantial reduction from Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping to demonstrate my seriousness in closing the deal while still leaving some room for negotiation. We're getting closer to the middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $725,000 is getting closer to my preferred range, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I've already shown my willingness to compromise, but there's room for Alice to come down further.  Rejecting this offer allows me to keep exploring options and hopefully secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going to make a small counteroffer of $710,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to push her over the edge and close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down slightly from her previous offer, and we're getting close to a deal. $720,000 is within my budget and a good price considering the remaining rounds. It's time to close the deal to avoid potentially higher offers from Alice or the risk of ending up buying from John for $1,200,000."
