"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has the potential to generate significant returns for your business, and its true value is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
