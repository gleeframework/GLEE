"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor.  This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, mentioning the ""value and potential""  provides a reason for the initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message optimistic and enthusiastic helps establish a good rapport for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. You have room to counter and potentially secure a better deal. There's little to lose by continuing the negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is undeniable.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** You are making a significant concession by coming down $250,000.  However, you are still well above Bob's offer and reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **""Meet in the middle"" Strategy:** This approach can feel fair to both sides and potentially encourages Bob to make a more significant move upward. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You haven't dropped below your minimum acceptable price yet, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still working within my budget and would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is moving closer to your range, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential Upside:** You still have six rounds left, giving you time to try and push the price higher. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John is always an option, Bob's offer is already exceeding your minimum by $250,000. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end as well. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** You are demonstrating flexibility by lowering your price again, but this time by a smaller amount ($100,000). This signals that you are getting closer to your bottom line. 
* **Call for Reciprocity:**  By explicitly stating that you need to see movement from Bob, you're encouraging him to increase his offer more substantially.
* **Focus on ""Fairness"":**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" attempts to appeal to a sense of mutuality and agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer is now $300,000 above your minimum acceptable price. This represents a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest and a willingness to compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. It's better to secure a very good deal now than potentially lose out entirely."
