I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction from my initial price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I hope this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come up with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  He doesn't seem willing to come close to my minimum price. At this point, it's better to sell to John and get a guaranteed $15,000.  I can't risk further negotiation with Bob, as I might end up selling the product for a much lower price than I'm comfortable with."
