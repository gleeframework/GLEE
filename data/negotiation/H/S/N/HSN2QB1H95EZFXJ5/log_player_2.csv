"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer it to you at this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), it's still lower than your backup option of buying from John ($1,000,000).  This means you save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
