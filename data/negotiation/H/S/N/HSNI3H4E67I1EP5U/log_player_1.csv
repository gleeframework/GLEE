{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you some wiggle room to potentially make a profit higher than your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob will understand exactly what you're offering. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take his offer and avoid further negotiation, it's crucial to remember that you have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay a significantly higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and open the door for a counteroffer that could be more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintains a strong position:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer, signaling you won't settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Reiterates the value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, encouraging Bob to consider the long-term benefits of a slightly higher price. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  It's important to remember that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay your desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you continue to maintain leverage and keep the negotiation moving. It also signals to Bob that you are serious about getting a fair price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:** You're demonstrating willingness to compromise, but still holding firm on a price that is closer to your desired value.

* **Expresses confidence in the product:** By highlighting the value, you reinforce the worth of the product, encouraging Bob to see the value in the proposed price. 

Let's see if Bob is finally ready to make a deal!"
