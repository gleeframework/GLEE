"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still on a tight budget. I can offer $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach our $12,000 minimum in a reasonable number of rounds. We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
