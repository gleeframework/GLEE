"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $120 to me. I'm hoping Bob will counter, allowing us to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least $120, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $120, getting $110 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and secures a deal without risking a counteroffer that could be worse."
