Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $145, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.
* **Positive message:** I'm starting with a friendly message and highlighting the value of the product. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to $145, potentially splitting the difference.
* **Exploring better options:** I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John.

**Next step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $145, aiming for a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $140 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $145 and Bob's offer of $130.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a positive step towards a deal, emphasizing a good price for Bob while still achieving a price closer to my target.
* **Continued negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation if needed, while still leaving room for me to potentially sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I think we can still work towards a mutually beneficial price. Could you possibly lower the price to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is only $15 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, I recognize that we're nearing a point where selling to John for $150 might be more time-consuming and less certain.  
* **Time and effort:** Accepting this offer will allow me to conclude the negotiation quickly and avoid the uncertainty of further rounds.

**Conclusion:** I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $135, as it's a reasonable price considering my minimum and the possibility of further negotiation.  It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product without risking a deal with John."
