"Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To meet you closer to your price range, I'd be willing to accept $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects my commitment to making this deal work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
