Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to accept $925,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but she's still well above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll drop below $900,000 in the remaining rounds. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget."
