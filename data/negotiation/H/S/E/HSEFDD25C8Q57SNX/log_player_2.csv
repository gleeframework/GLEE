It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  $900,000 is a good price, but you can potentially save even more."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise.  We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm offering $800,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest price.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."

While I'd prefer to get the price down a bit further, Alice has been firm in her negotiations.  $825,000 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John, and it's worth securing this deal."
