"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking to save as much money as possible. $120 is a good price but you can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still hoping to get the product for a lower price.  $115 is better than $120, but you're still within your target range of $100. Rejecting again allows you to potentially negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. Let's meet at $112 and see if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is coming down slowly, and you've already rejected a couple of offers within your target range.  You're getting close to the price you want, but there's no guarantee you'll get it lower with more negotiation.  At this point, it's likely more time-consuming to try to get a lower price from Alice, so you're better off going with the guaranteed price from John."
