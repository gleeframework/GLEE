"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. Let's meet at $112 and see if that works for you.",112.0,Alice,5,
