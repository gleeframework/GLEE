"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in its benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a slight discount, it's still above your target price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to get the product for a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my limits."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, which would be $90 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While she moved closer to your offer, $90 is still above your desired price point.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You still have several rounds left, and you've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate. 
* **John's offer provides a backup:** You can always buy from John if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less. How about $87? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest offer, I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $88. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing you to stay within your budget. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $88 is less than your maximum of $100.
* **Small difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and your target price is small.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising her price.  There's also a risk that you might run out of rounds.

It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
