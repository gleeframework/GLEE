Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on profit. How about we meet at $81? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $81. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price for you, as opposed to risking it for a few dollars less and potentially ending up with John's $120 price."
