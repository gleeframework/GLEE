"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if you're willing to meet me halfway.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a better offer than your initial one, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
