"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than my minimum of $80, and I'm willing to negotiate within reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
