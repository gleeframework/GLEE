"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a lower counter-offer from Alice or can proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
