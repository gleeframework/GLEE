"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $8,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a little too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,875? This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000, which is my minimum price.  It's better than settling for less with Bob."
