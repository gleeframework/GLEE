Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($8,000), but lower than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for negotiation.  

If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring you achieve your minimum goal."
