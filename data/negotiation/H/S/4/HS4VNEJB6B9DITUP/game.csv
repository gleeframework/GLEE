"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price, but I'd need to receive at least $900000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the unique value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering and the price I'm willing to pay.",850000.0,Bob,4,
