"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's talk!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and your own valuation. Let's try to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
