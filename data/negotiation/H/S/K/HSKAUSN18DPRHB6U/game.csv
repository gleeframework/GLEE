"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're at your maximum, Bob. I'll think about it... but I'm still not sure if I can part with it for that price. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
