"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more competitive price for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and to make this work for both of us, I propose a price of $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this product.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,700,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,700,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm proposing $1,775,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
