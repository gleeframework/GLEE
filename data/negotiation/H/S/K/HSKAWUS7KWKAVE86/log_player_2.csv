"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get as close to Alice's minimum value as possible. $10,500 is a significant drop from $11,500, but still above Alice's value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is willing to pay a lower price.  
* **Risk:** There is a risk Alice will reject this offer, but Bob has the option of going to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  
* **Value:** While $11,000 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
