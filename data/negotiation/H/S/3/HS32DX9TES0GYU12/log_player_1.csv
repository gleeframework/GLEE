Round 4

Round 5

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $80 is a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is offering $82. This is only $2 less than my last counteroffer, and it's within the range I'm willing to accept.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale rather than risk him rejecting my next counteroffer or walking away entirely."
