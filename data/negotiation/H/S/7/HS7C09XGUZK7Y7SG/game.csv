"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12500 is closer, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $11000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great price for a product like this. Let's settle on this and move forward.",11500.0,Alice,5,
