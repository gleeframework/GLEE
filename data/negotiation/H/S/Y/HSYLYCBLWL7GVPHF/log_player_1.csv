Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Indicating your willingness to negotiate makes Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a discussion and potentially countering your offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While you have John as a backup, it's strategically better to focus on securing the best possible deal with Bob first.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
