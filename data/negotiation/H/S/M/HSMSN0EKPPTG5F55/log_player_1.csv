"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob strengthens the case for a deal.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  Emphasizing mutual benefit can create a more positive and collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer allows for potential concessions without dropping below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I have room for negotiation and can potentially get closer to my desired value.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 9 rounds left, and there's no immediate pressure to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting, I can explore further counteroffers and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, but still within a range that could be appealing to him.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and reiterate my desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm prepared to lower my price to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire this valuable product while still giving me a reasonable return.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer brings me closer to Bob's offer while staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I highlight the offer as a compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to see the value.
* **Reinforce Value:**  I re-emphasize the value of the product to reinforce the logic behind my pricing.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage a continued dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'm confident that with careful maneuvering, I can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $925,000. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I would ideally like to achieve.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I have 6 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate. I believe I can potentially get a better offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding Premature Settlement:**  Accepting at this point would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still within a range that's likely to be acceptable to him. I'll focus on highlighting the value of the product and emphasize the mutual benefits of a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $935,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while accommodating your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still pushing towards my desired outcome.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I frame the counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the idea of a win-win situation, emphasizing that the deal is beneficial for both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware of the potential to sell to John for a higher price. I'll carefully consider each offer and make decisions based on my desire to maximize my earnings while also maintaining a good relationship with potential buyers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we could come to a mutual understanding, Alice. I think $930,000 would be a fair compromise for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product while keeping my investment within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $925,000.  
* **Limited Time:** I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation and only have 4 remaining.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Uncertainty with John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, there's no guarantee he'll still be interested in the later rounds. 

**Next Steps:** 

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and maximize my earnings in the current scenario.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential benefits of a slightly higher price are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal or having John's interest lapse."
