"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** Bob wants to get the price down, but he's not going too low with his first counteroffer.  $11,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's value of $10,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Bob keeps the message friendly and avoids coming across as overly demanding."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still gives you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to his ideal value, but he wants to see if he can push for an even better deal.  Rejecting and counter-offering again shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and leaves room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  Bob proposes a compromise that's exactly halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows he's willing to work towards a solution.
* **Fair Deal:** Bob emphasizes that this offer is fair for both parties.  
* **Keep Negotiating:** Bob avoids accepting Alice's offer, hoping to get even closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12250. This price still leaves you a decent saving, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $12,250 is getting closer to Bob's ideal value of $10,000.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Rejecting and counter-offering again could lead to a stalemate or Alice refusing to negotiate further.  Accepting now ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a deal falling apart.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's wise to accept a deal that's close to Bob's target, rather than risk having to buy from John at a higher price."
