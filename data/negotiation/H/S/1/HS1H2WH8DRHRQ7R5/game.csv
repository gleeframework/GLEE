"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still gives you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12250. This price still leaves you a decent saving, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
