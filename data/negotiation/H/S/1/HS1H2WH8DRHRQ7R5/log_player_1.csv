Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  $11,000 is still below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still gives you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This price still leaves you a decent saving, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12250}
