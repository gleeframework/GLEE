"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob and offering a ""discount"" to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Openness:** I end with a question to invite Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I have room for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers. It's worth trying to get closer to my target price.
* **John is a safe backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $11,500. This is a significant discount, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget and express willingness to negotiate.
* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I'm lowering my price but not by too much, demonstrating that I'm serious about a deal while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlight the value:** I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle of our budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $11,000 is still below my target, but it's getting closer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in the next rounds.
* **Time is running out:**  I'm already halfway through the 10 rounds, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.
* **John's offer is a safe backup:** If the deal falls through, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

**This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.**"
