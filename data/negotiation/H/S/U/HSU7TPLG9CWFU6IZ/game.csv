"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,3,
