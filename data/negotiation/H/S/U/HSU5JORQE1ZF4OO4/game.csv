"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay closer to $10750.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11200 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10900, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10900 and $11200, which would be $11050. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11050.0,Alice,7,
