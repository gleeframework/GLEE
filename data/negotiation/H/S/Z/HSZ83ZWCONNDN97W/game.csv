"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's market value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the market value and my initial offer.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this transaction.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,
