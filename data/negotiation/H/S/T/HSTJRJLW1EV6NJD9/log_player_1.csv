Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could sell to John for that amount, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm making a slight concession by coming down to $105, but still maintaining a price higher than my minimum. I'm highlighting the value again to emphasize that my offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While selling to John for $100 is a possibility, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for a product that you value at $120. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob again and making it clear that this is my final offer."
