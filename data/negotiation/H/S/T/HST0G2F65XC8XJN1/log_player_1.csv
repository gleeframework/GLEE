{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects it.  I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can't exceed $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it guarantees I don't lose any money and allows me to complete the sale without further negotiation."
