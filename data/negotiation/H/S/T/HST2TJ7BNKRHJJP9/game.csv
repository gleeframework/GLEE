"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your budgetary constraints, the value this product offers is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product could be a great investment for me, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
