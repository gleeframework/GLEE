Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could hold out for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 secures a profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
