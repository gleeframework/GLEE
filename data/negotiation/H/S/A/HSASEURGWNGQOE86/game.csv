"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $11,000? I'm sure we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
