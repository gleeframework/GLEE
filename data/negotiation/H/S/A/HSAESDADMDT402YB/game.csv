"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial returns that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the long-term benefits you'll reap.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it will bring to my operations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
