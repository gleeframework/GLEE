Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it will bring to my operations.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations has risks. Bob might not go higher, and I'd lose the opportunity to sell for $1,600,000. John's offer is my safety net, but exceeding it is a win.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
