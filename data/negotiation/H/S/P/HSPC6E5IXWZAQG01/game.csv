"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I understand its value to you, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $950,000. This price is fair given the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000. This price is fair considering both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make it happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
