"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm not going to accept it. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or go with John's offer."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price.  If I can't, I'll still have the option to buy from John."
