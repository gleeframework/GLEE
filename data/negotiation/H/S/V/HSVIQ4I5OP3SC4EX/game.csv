"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both parties. My initial offer is $850,000. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $750,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for you.  Let's keep the conversation going.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $720,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $720,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $735,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable acquisition for you. What do you think?",735000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $735,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $730,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you need.",730000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $727,500.  This is my final offer. It's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're on board.",727500.0,Bob,8,
