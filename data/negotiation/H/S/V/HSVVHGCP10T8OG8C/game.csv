"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the true value and potential of this product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. While your offer is tempting, I believe the value of this product is closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to make this final concession as a gesture of good faith. Please let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $975,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to make one final offer of $975,000. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
