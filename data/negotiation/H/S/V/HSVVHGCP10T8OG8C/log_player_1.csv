I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to make one final offer of $975,000. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you.

Bob is holding firm at $975,000 and is even suggesting he might walk away.  While that's a negotiation tactic, it's clear he's unlikely to move significantly closer to your desired price. Accepting his offer means leaving $225,000 on the table.  Selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 is the best business decision."
