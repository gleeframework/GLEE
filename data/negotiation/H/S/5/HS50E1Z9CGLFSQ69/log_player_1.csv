Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for this product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
