"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price well below its worth to you, while still giving me a significant profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price still allows you a healthy profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,025,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product at a significant discount while still letting you earn a substantial profit.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
