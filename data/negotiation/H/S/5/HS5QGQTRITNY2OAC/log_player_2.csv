"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save even more by negotiating. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation and explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for you. It's lower than what you're willing to pay from John ($1,200,000) and closer to your initial counteroffer of $900,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of a counteroffer being rejected and losing time is high.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price."
