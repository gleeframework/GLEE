{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $80, but it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving the door open:**  The message doesn't close the door to negotiation, implying flexibility in the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** While I'm not willing to accept $80, I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still holding a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  The message reiterates a desire to work with Bob and focuses on the benefits of a ""fair price.""
* **Re-emphasizing value:**  By mentioning that $100 is still a good deal, I subtly remind Bob of the value I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still hoping to find a solution within my budget of $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still significantly less.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer again maintains my leverage and shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but $90 is still just a little too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would give both of us a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** This offer is a further compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still maintaining a price higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that $105 is a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and clear, focusing on the specific offer and leaving space for a prompt response."
