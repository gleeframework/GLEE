Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
