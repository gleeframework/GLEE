"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's slightly lower than that. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm open to negotiating further if you'd like. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's still cheaper than buying from John, and it's closer to my ideal price than Alice's initial offer.  There's a chance I could get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
