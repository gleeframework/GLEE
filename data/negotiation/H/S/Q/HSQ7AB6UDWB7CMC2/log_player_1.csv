I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been going back and forth for a while now, and at this point, $10,300 is a good price.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on this sale altogether."
