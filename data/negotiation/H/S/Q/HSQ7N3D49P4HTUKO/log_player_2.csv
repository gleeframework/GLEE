"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to accept $105 for it? I think that's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I can go down to $110, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $115 to $110.  This is a good deal for Bob, considering he can buy it from John for $120. There's a good chance Alice won't come down further, so accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
