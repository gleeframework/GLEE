"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's serious about buying.  I'm also aware that John is a backup option, so I'm not overly concerned with losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can nudge him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate to make a deal. I'm hoping this will encourage him to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm rejecting his offer and going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm lowering my price again to show him my willingness to compromise, but it's still above my minimum and I'm not willing to go any lower. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I've already made a few concessions and I don't think there's room for further negotiation. I've also used up several rounds, so I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  It's best to cut my losses and sell to John, who is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000."
