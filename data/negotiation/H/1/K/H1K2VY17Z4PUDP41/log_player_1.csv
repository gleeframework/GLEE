Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a significant investment, and I'd like to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm showing flexibility by reducing my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal outcome. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my stance on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. John is a secure option at $800,000, but I believe I can close the deal with Bob for a price closer to my target. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. Let's settle on $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal amicably.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering the product at the price that John is willing to pay, showing Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but also that I'm not willing to go lower. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept the offer, hopefully allowing me to finalize the deal with him."
