You have three options:

``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer of $9,000 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant discount from her initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. I'll reject and continue to negotiate to see if I can get a better price."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $10,500.  This is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and closer to my target price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is still unwilling to budge significantly from her initial price, and I'm not sure how much further I can negotiate with her.  I'm better off buying from John at $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and get a better price than Alice's current offer."
