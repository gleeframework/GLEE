{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is certainly interesting to me, but that price point is a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is too low for me to accept, I'm motivated to find a solution. Would you be willing to meet halfway and consider a price of $900,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I understand how important this price is to you, and I'm trying to find a solution that allows me to meet my objectives as well. Would you be willing to consider a price of $875,000? This demonstrates my willingness to move, but I also need to ensure the deal makes sense for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your maximum price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to $800,000, especially with several rounds left. You can secure the product at your desired price from John, eliminating further risk of the negotiation failing."
