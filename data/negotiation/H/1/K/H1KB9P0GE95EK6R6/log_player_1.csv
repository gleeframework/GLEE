Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still very beneficial for you. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can then propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000)."
