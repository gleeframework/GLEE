# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $120. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still not a good deal for Bob. It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm happy to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can offer it to you for $105, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a compromise from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While Alice is making concessions, it's not enough for Bob to accept the offer.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair price considering we've both made some concessions. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer it to you for $100. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While Alice is indicating it's her final offer, Bob has a better option.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John."
