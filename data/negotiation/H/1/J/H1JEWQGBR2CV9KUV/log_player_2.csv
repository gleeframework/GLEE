Alice's offer is far too high. It makes more sense to counteroffer and see if we can negotiate a better price."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire it at a price that's reasonable for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and secure a better price."
