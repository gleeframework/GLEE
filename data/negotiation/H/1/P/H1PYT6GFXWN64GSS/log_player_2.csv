Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's not worthwhile to accept this offer. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible and wants to save as much money as he can. He starts with a significantly lower counteroffer of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a considerable amount of savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to get a price closer to his $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's budget. While it's tempting to accept, Bob is getting closer to his limit with each round. There's still a good chance of getting a lower price with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made a significant effort to negotiate a lower price. In this round, he's offering his maximum budget of $12,000. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can buy the product from John without any further negotiation. This counteroffer is a clear signal of his willingness to buy the product at his limit."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down in price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price and may be able to get closer to his $12,000 limit. It's risky, but with limited rounds remaining, Bob should continue to push for the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is nearing the end of the negotiations and has to make a decision. He's offering a slightly higher price than his maximum budget to show flexibility, but still,  trying to get as close to his ideal price as possible. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still buy from John for $12,000. This is a gamble, but it might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice.  While $13,500 is slightly over his ideal price, it's a much better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  He's likely to save some money and still get the product he wants.  Accepting this offer is the best option in this situation."
