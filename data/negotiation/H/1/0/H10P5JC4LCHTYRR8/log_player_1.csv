Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum potential profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $80, there's a chance he might pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.  
* **Negotiation room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  The optimal offer can depend on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style, as well as any additional information you might have about the product's desirability."
