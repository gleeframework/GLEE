"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still gives you a great deal on a product that you value at $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there. How about $10,000? That's fair for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
