Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for the value it provides,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price to the product's worth rather than just stating a number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and inviting, suggesting I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob counters.

While I have a backup buyer, I want to maximize my profit with Bob if possible."
