"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I think this product is a good fit, $6,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $5,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your needs.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $6,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $5,750. This represents a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable deal.",5750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and brings us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",6000.0,Bob,6,
