**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $1,150,000 is a reasonable price and saves you $350,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice stating this is her final offer adds pressure. Continuing negotiations might not yield a better price.
* **Time:** You've already used 5 rounds. While you have time, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower."
