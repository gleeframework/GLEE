,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a fair price considering its unique features and quality.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $152. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $152. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $140 again, but I'm willing to add a small concession. I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $10, so the total price would be $130 for the product and the service.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional service you're offering, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $150. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $145, and I'll throw in the same service you're offering. The total price would be $155 for the product and the service.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product and the service, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",140.0,Bob,8,
