"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
