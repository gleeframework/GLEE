Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,"" you create a narrative that justifies the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. This allows you to potentially settle on a price higher than John's offer."
