{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value of $12,000. It allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps build a positive relationship with Bob and encourages him to consider my offer.

I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also prepared to negotiate with Bob if necessary. If he rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is better than my minimum of $12,000, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. Since I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  

I'll now counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my initial price of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $15,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price of $18,000. Would you be willing to consider $16,500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $16,500 is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain my desired profit margin.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and use the message to reiterate my desire for a higher price. I frame $16,500 as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing. 

I believe this approach will keep the negotiation moving forward while keeping me in a good position to either secure a favorable deal with Bob or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $15000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his $15,000 offer.  While it's better than my minimum of $12,000, it's still not ideal, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  

Since I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $12,000, it's the most logical choice at this point.  It ensures I get at least my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a complete breakdown of the deal."
