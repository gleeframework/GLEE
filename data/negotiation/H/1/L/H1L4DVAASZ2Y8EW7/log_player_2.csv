"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate with Alice.  There's no need to accept an offer that's still above his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows Alice's minimum is $800,000 and he's willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting at $850,000 is a reasonable middle ground.  This leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  He wants to show Alice he's serious about buying the product while still trying to get a lower price. By offering $860,000, he's signaling a willingness to compromise.  He's also keeping in mind that he has a backup option with John, so he doesn't need to rush into a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's only $10,000 more than his last counteroffer and significantly lower than John's offer.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly likely that he won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, especially since she's already shown a willingness to compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and saves him the risk of not being able to reach a deal with Alice."
