"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  We start with an offer lower than Alice's but still within a reasonable range ($105). This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a good rapport with Alice and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with $110. This is the best price I can offer given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice came down to $110, which is a reasonable compromise and saves you $10 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's also a chance Alice could walk away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

At this point, accepting the $110 offer represents a good balance of potential savings and risk."
