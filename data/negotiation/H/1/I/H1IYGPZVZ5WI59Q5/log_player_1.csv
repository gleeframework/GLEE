"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product.  While I can't disclose the details publicly, I can assure you its worth is significant, exceeding $1,000,000 to me.  To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is a generous starting point, given the product's true value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. Considering the information provided, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than the product's value to me. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I want to explore if I can achieve a better price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,350,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd love to push for more, we're nearing the middle ground. Accepting this offer secures a good profit, and with limited rounds left, it's a smart move to finalize the deal."
