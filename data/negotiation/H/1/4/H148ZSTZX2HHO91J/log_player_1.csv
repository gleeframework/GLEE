"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I believe the product is worth more than $8,000 to me, so I want to see if I can get a higher price.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but it's closer to my goal than $8,000. I'll see if I can get closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  We're getting closer, and I'm optimistic that we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, $9,200 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000.  We've gone through a few rounds and it seems like this is the best I can get from Bob. It's important to be realistic about the market and accept a good deal when it's offered."
