Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, $1,000,000.  This is a high starting point, but I'm confident in the product's value and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my expectations.  If he rejects, I can always explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my $1,000,000 mark with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $950,000.  This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my value. It's a strategic move to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I'm concerned further negotiation might not lead to a better outcome.  It's time to secure the sale with John and guarantee my desired price."
