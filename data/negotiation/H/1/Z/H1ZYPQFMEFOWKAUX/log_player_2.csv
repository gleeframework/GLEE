Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $120. Alice's initial offer of $160 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price below $120, so starting with a counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable first step. This signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating, while still leaving room for some negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  However, Bob is getting closer to his target and it's worth seeing if he can negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final offer. It's exactly at his maximum price, and he's willing to walk away if Alice doesn't accept it. He's shown he's serious about negotiating and has made some concessions, so hopefully, Alice will accept this offer. If not, he's ready to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  He's already made his final offer and is not willing to go any higher.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for his maximum price of $120.  This avoids further negotiation with Alice and ensures that Bob gets the product at his desired price."
