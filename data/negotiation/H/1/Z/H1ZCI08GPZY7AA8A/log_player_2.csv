"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value and your desired price. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, although it is a significant reduction from her initial offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can realistically afford.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250, but I need to be closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While it is getting closer, with only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $12,000 and securing the deal."
