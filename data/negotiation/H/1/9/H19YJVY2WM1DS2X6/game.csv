"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing you to close the deal quickly and me to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we appreciate your persistence, and we're willing to make another concession. However, we can't go any lower than $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and we're willing to meet you halfway again. We're hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",825000.0,Alice,5,
