Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. My starting offer is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle -  how about $10,750? "", ""product_price"": 10750}

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and even though I'm willing to come down, we're still not close enough to make this worthwhile for me. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to keep haggling with Bob and risk getting nothing."
