Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to build his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, my minimum price is $8,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially with the knowledge that I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $7,000 is a good price, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $8500. I'd be willing to meet you at $7500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal, especially with the safety net of John's offer. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. While $7,500 is a good price, I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we settle for $8,000? This way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
