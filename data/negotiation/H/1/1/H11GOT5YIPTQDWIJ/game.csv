"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm a bit lower on my budget than that. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This reflects a considerable discount on its true value, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I still think $800,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is closer, but it's still a significant gap from where I value the product. How about we settle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while acknowledging your budget.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of what's being offered. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $862,500? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",862500.0,Bob,8,
