Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and Bob's estimated value of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'd rather secure a sale than risk a further negotiation."
