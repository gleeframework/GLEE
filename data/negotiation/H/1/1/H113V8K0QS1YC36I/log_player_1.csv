Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a fair price considering Bob values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$97 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
