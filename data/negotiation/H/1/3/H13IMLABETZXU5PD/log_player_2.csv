"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate since Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  Counteroffering allows you to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $12,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good deal. It also reflects your understanding of the product's worth to you ($15,000) and your willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is only slightly better than her initial offer of $12,000.  This shows she's not willing to budge much on the price.  It's still worth rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering again, as you still have room to bargain between your maximum price of $15,000 and her minimum of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant increase from your previous offer of $9,000, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $12,500, showing you're determined to get a better price.  This leaves room for a potential agreement and avoids going directly to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your ideal price but significantly lower than John's $15,000. This is a good deal considering that you are willing to pay $15,000.  Further negotiation might yield a better price, but the risk of losing the product to another buyer is increasing, making it a smart choice to accept Alice's offer.  You are saving $2,000 compared to buying from John."
