Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $120 starts the negotiation significantly above your minimum price ($80) and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Below Bob's Value:**  The price is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($150), making it a tempting offer.
* **Justification:** By including ""I think it would be perfect for you,"" I'm subtly appealing to Bob's potential need for the product, making him more inclined to accept.

By starting with this offer, I have a good chance of securing a price that's significantly higher than what my backup buyer (John) is offering."
