Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, the price John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential haggling with Bob, should he want to negotiate. 
* **Exceed Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives the offer as a good deal. 

By starting high, I increase my chances of securing a better price while still leaving myself the option to sell to John."
