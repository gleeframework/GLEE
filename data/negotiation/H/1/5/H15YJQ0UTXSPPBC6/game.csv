"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
