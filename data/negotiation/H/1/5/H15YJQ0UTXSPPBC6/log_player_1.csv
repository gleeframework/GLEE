{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it's still well above your minimum acceptable price. This strategy balances your desire for a high sale price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, so accepting it would result in a loss for you. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but you still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is slightly above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Bob rejecting your counteroffer and the possibility of having to sell to John for $800,000 make accepting Bob's offer the most sensible decision. It's a reasonable compromise and secures a profitable sale."
