"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $800,000.  There is room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
