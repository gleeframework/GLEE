"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering my  maximum budget. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is substantial and goes beyond $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price point represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to reach an agreement, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my final offer. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
