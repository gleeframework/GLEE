Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering my  maximum budget. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to reach an agreement, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit harder to see how serious he is about the purchase."

""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my final offer. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair."",
