Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see if he's interested in this price before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190} 
```

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $180 is still a good profit for me.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely, and I don't want to sell to John for a lower price."
