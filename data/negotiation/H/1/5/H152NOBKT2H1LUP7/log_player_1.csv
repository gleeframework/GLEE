"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price than the minimum you're willing to accept. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.  You've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price.  You're not willing to accept such a low price at this point. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below what you're aiming for.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 725000} 
```"
