"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a unique asset, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair value considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,700,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential of this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
