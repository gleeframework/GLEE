Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair value considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,700,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** It's a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations with no guarantee of a better offer from Bob means potentially missing out on other opportunities.  

Accepting $1,000,000 now secures a good return and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
