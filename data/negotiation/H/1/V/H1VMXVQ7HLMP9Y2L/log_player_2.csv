"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John. Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
