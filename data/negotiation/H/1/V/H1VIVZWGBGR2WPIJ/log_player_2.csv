"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's far above his budget.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget. There's room for further negotiation, and he can try to push for a price closer to his limit."
