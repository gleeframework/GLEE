"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product but can't afford $1,200,000. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is the highest you're willing to pay, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
