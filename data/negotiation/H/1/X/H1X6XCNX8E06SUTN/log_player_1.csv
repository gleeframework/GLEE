"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $120, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is still above Bob's offer but shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages further negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price of $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
