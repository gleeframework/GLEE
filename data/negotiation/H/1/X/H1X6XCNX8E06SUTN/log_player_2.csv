{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept, as it's just $5 above my ideal price and only $5 below her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within my budget and have a few rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get the price down to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally offering my maximum price of $100. This is a fair offer, as it's the price I'm willing to pay and it's also the price John is selling the product for. I'm hoping Alice will accept, as she has already lowered her price significantly. If she doesn't accept, I'll just buy the product from John."
