I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about selling but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but his offer is still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I think I can get closer to my desired price without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still hoping to close the gap and get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm trying to be flexible, but also firm on what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been through several rounds of negotiations, and while Bob has come up a bit, he's still not meeting my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk going any lower and having him reject my offer again.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  At least this way I'm guaranteed a sale and I'm not losing more time and energy on a negotiation that's not going in my favor."
