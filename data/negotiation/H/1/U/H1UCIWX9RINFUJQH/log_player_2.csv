"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than our actual maximum ($12,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards and still hopefully stay below our limit.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a lower number first, we're trying to anchor the negotiation in a more favorable range. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $14,000 is still above our maximum budget. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice is clearly willing to bargain, which means there's a good chance we can get the price down further. 

Let's keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're still staying below our maximum.
* **Justifying the Offer:** By mentioning our budget constraints again and emphasizing ""fairness,"" we're giving Alice reasons to accept without revealing our absolute limit. 

It's a delicate balance, but hopefully, this counteroffer will lead to a deal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we compromise at $13,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:**  $13,000 is getting very close to John's price. While it's tempting to accept, we're still in a position to negotiate.
* **Leverage:** We know John is our backup option at $12,000, so we don't need to settle for anything higher.  

Let's see if we can push Alice just a bit more!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000.  If you're able to match that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** We're being transparent about John's offer (without revealing his name). This adds credibility to our position and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Final Offer:** We're presenting $12,000 as our best and final offer.  This puts the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to make the sale or risk losing it.

This strategy is a calculated risk.  It's possible Alice will walk away, but it's also possible she values the sale enough to meet our price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm confident that mine is the best quality. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the unique features of this product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unwilling to go down to $12,000.  
* **John's Price is Better:**  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. We have a guaranteed offer from John at a better price.

It's time to walk away and buy from John. We've successfully negotiated a good deal by using him as leverage!"
