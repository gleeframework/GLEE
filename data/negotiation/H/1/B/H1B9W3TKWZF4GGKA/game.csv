"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go up to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11250.0,Alice,5,
