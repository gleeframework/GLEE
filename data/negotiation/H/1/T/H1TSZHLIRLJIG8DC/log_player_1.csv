Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to what I want.  I'm also framing it as a ""fantastic product"" to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value and it's a good deal considering the potential of further negotiation. It's better to secure the sale at $90 rather than risk getting a lower price or going through further negotiation rounds."
