Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is substantial and I can't let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While it's still less than my ideal price, $1,050,000 is a reasonable offer and higher than John's guaranteed offer. It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk losing the deal by pushing Bob further."
