"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1600000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
