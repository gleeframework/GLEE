"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for a special price of $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your maximum price:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $10,000, which is your maximum price. This is better than accepting Alice's offer and paying $9,500, even though it's less than your maximum price."
