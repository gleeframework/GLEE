"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While your assessment of the product's value to me is not entirely accurate, I'm willing to move closer to your price. How about we settle on $1,275,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's significant worth to both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000 and my initial offer was $1,200,000.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
