"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I will get from the product. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product will bring to your operations.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $950,000? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
