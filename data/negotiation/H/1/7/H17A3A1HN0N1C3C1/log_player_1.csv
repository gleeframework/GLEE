Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I will get from the product. Can you meet me halfway?

While I'm willing to be flexible,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product will bring to your operations.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $950,000? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
