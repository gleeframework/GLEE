,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options.",16000.0,Bob,4,
