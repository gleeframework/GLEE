"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in your product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation and the potential value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account your valuation and the potential value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $890000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.",890000.0,Alice,5,
