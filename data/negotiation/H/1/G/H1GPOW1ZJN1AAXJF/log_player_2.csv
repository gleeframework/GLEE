"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($950,000 vs $800,000).  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's a lot of room for negotiation here. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account your valuation and the potential value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than her own valuation.  While it's a decrease from her original offer, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject her offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $890000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is still higher than her own valuation, but it's getting closer to my target.  It's also significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and I may not get a much better price.  I'm comfortable with this price, so I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
