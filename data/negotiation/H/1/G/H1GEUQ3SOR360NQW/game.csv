"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and potential for your business.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,050,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This would still leave me with a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
