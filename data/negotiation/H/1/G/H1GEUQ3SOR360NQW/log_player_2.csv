"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and potential for your business.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,050,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This would still leave me with a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my desired price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's also lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's worth accepting and saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
