"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,500. What do you think?"", 
 ""product_price"": 22500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your target price. This allows room for concessions and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,500, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation around a higher number. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $22,500 price tag is negotiable. I expect Bob to counter, and this gives me space to gradually reduce the price while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above my minimum ($15,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit high for me.  Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step closer, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap. Selling to John for $15,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $19,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
 ""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Still Strong:** I've reduced my price by $3,500, showing willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still substantially higher than Bob's offer and well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to justify the relatively high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will give me a better understanding of how much further I might need to adjust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $15,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I started high hoping to get more, there's no guarantee further negotiation will be successful. Accepting now secures the sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
