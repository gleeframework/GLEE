Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'll offer you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John than to risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on the deal altogether."
