"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",140.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice.  How about $100 even? That's my final offer.,100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'll offer you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is my final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
