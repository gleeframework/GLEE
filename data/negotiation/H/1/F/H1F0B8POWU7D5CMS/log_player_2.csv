"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You have a clear upper limit of $1,200,000, and there's room to potentially save money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000 at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $900,000 offer, and $850,000 is within your budget.  You can likely get a better price with further negotiation, but given Alice's statement that this is her final offer, it's worth considering accepting to avoid risking losing the deal altogether. You still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
