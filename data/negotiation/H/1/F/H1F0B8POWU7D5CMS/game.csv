"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000 at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",850000.0,Alice,3,
