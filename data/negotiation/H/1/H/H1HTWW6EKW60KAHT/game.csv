"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
