"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500, given its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or consider other options."
