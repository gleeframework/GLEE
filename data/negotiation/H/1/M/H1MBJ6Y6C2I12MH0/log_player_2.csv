Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to sell at $8250. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. How about $8500, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. He is getting the product for $500 less than his maximum budget, and Alice is offering a bonus feature worth $500.  This is a win-win situation, and it's likely that if he rejects the offer, Alice might not offer it again.  While he could try to negotiate lower, the risk of losing the deal and the bonus feature outweighs the potential savings."
