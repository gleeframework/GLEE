"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. My new offer is $1,550,000. This price acknowledges the value we both see in the product and provides a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a strong return on investment.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my offer to $1,500,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, given the product's value. I truly believe this deal will be mutually beneficial and worth your investment.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,500,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more movement. Would you be willing to consider $1,475,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
