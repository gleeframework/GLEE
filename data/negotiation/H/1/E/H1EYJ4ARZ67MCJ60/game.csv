"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think it's a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,200,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant advantage.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
