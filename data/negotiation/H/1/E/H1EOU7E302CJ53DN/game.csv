"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9500? That gives you a good deal and still leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go to $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little too low.  Let's compromise at $9000. This gives you a great price and me a fair deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
