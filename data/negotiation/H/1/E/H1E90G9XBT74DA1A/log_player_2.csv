"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Although Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your $1,200,000 maximum, you can do better.  You know John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer to avoid losing the sale."
