"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. My initial offer is $10,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. To continue our discussion, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a compromise that takes into account both the value of the product to you and the cost to me. I hope this offer aligns better with your budget while still allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it is still a considerable amount of money for Bob to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. In light of our previous discussions, I am proposing a final offer of $9,250 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between the value of the product to you and the cost to me. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. With only 5 rounds left, the likelihood of Alice dropping her price further is low. Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000, as it's the best deal he can get within his budget and the time constraints."
