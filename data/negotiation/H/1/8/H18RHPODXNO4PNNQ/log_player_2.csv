"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and attempting a counteroffer. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product is worth $8,000 to her.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, potentially leading to a deal that is more favorable to you than buying from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within your budget and better than buying from John for $15,000. It's a reasonable compromise, considering she rejected your counteroffer.  There's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price in the next round.  Accepting the offer now is the most sensible option."
