"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in this product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
