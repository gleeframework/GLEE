Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,750. Accepting this offer gets you a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $15,000."
