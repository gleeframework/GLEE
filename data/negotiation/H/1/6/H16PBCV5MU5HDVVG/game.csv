"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $10,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree on. Would you be willing to come down just a bit more, say to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
