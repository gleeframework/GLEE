Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on price, she's unlikely to reach our target of $8,000. We've already presented our best offer, and going back and forth might not yield a better result.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John at our target price."
