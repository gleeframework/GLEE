Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" of the product provides a subtle justification for the higher price, even without explicitly stating what that value is.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning that you'll list it publicly, you introduce a subtle element of time pressure, encouraging Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price. Remember, your fallback is $12,000 from John, so any price above that is a profit."
