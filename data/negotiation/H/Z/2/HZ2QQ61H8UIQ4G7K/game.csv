"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $160 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $140 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $130 is close, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $115?  This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $115 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot on the price, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115. I can do $122.50 for the product. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",122.5,Alice,7,
