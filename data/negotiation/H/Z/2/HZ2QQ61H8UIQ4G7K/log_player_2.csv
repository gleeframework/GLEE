Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $115 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot on the price, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115. I can do $122.50 for the product. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer of $122.50 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You've already reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result with Alice.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $120 and stay within your budget."
