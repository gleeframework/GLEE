"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice has come down to $15,000, which is still a bit more than I want to pay, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept the offer and buy the product from Alice."
