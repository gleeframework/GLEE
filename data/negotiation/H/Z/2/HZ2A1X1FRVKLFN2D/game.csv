"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than $12,000. How about we start with $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our ongoing dialogue and the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to consider the product price at $11,000. I hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that's even more agreeable. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? This would be a great compromise, allowing both of us to get what we want.",10500.0,Bob,4,
