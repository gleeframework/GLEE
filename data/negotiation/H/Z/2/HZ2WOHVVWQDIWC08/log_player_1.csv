{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product for sale that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives you the chance to see if Bob is interested and potentially get a higher price.  It's important to start with a price you're comfortable with, but also be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
