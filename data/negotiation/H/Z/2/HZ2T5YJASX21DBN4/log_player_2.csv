"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. 
* **You have a backup option:** John is willing to sell you the product for $8,000, your target price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the product at the price you want."
