"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate.  By rejecting the initial offer, you signal that you're willing to bargain.  This opens the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds interesting.  However, I'm only able to go up to $100 at this point. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A significant drop from $120 shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasoning:**  Giving a reason (""only able to go up to $100"") makes your counteroffer more persuasive.
* **Openness:**  Asking if she'd ""consider"" leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice has already moved down from $120 to $110. This indicates she's flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still room for a lower price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about $105? That's halfway between our last offers."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Acknowledge Alice's concession and show you're willing to meet her halfway.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $105 is a reasonable compromise, suggesting you're willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Reiterate Budget:**  Mentioning your budget keeps the focus on your financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $110, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $115 is only $5 above your ideal price of $110.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Alice has shown she's firm at $115, and further negotiation may not yield a significant decrease.
* **Risk of Missing Out:** There's a risk that continuing to negotiate will lead to Alice getting impatient or you running out of rounds.
* **John's Price:**  While John's offer of $120 is an option, accepting $115 is a better deal and saves you $5."
