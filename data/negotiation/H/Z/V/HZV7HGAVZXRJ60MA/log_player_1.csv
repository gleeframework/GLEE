"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'm confident Bob is still interested and willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
