"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I believe the product is worth more than $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer is now only $500 lower than my last counteroffer. There are still 6 rounds remaining, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and minimizes potential losses from further negotiation."
