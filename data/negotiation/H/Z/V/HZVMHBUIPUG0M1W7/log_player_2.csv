Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is unfortunately far below the product's true value. Given its unique capabilities and the potential benefits it holds for your business, I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be a fair reflection of its worth. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000. This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment while giving you a substantial opportunity to acquire this valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to move towards a more agreeable price.  While $700000 is closer to my desired range, it still falls short of the product's true value.

This price reflects the value we both recognize while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.
