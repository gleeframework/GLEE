{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to make more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You're not immediately going for the highest possible price, allowing for a back-and-forth. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  If he rejects your offer, consider how much you're willing to lower the price before selling to John.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a bit on a tight budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you have the potential to get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

Here's why:

* **You know Bob values the product at $10,000:**  He's likely willing to pay more than $8,000.
* **Rejecting his offer doesn't mean you lose the sale:**  You can still counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

You can then make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial $9,500, but willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** You're not sticking to your original price, but you're not accepting Bob's offer either. 
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $8,750 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It shows flexibility:**  You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

Keep in mind that Bob might counteroffer again.  Be prepared to adjust your price further depending on how much you want to sell the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than your minimum of $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation is risky, as there's a chance he might continue to lower his offer.  While John's offer is not ideal, it's a guaranteed sale that meets your minimum requirement.  It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further potential losses."
