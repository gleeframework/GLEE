"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $15,000, so accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** You can counteroffer and try to get a better price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so you have time to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet.** John's price is your absolute limit, so it's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, $12,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $13,750. This is a competitive price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your preferred price.** You're aiming for a price below $12,500.
* **You have time to negotiate further.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and hopefully get closer to your target price. 
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.** You can likely get a better deal with Alice, especially since you've already established a starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, so how about $13,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your maximum.**  While it's slightly above your preferred price, it's still within your budget and represents a good deal.
* **There's risk in continuing to negotiate.**  You have a limited number of rounds, and Alice has already made several concessions. There's a chance she might refuse further offers, leaving you with the more expensive option of buying from John.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product.**  You avoid the risk of losing the product to another buyer and achieve a price that's still within your budget."
