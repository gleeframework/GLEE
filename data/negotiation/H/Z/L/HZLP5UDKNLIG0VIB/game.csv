"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, $12,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $13,750. This is a competitive price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, so how about $13,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.
