Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, aiming for a higher price with Bob first maximizes potential profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $135 strikes a balance:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), giving us room for negotiation if needed.
    * It's still a reasonable markup from our minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message positions the offer as a ""special price"" to entice Bob while avoiding mentioning absolute bottom lines. 
 
Let's see if Bob bites!"
