"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $600,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
