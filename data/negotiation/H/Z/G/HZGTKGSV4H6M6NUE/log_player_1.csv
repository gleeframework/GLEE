Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, so I'm offering $13,500.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
