Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and offers a significant return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Why this strategy is better than offering a lower price:**

* **Risk of Underselling:** Offering a price closer to $800,000 leaves potential profit on the table. 
* **No Incentive for Bob:** A low offer doesn't incentivize Bob to negotiate and he might accept immediately, leaving you with less than you could have gotten."
