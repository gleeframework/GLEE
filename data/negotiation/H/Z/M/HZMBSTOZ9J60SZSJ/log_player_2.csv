It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has shown she's very reluctant to move significantly down from her offer.  While it *might* be possible to get her a little lower than $1,120,000, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her not budging and us ending up with a worse deal later.  John's guaranteed $1,000,000 price is the smarter move now."
