"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is great, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from your initial offer.  To be honest though, $1,150,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I am too. How about we settle at $1,100,000?  That's a good round number, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a round number, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counteroffer at $1,120,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,7,
