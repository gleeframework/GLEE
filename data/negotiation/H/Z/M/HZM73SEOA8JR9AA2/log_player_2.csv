"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within your budget and a good deal considering you are willing to pay up to $150.  It's likely you won't get a better price from Alice, and you are saving $15 compared to buying from John."
