Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.
