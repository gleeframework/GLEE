Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.

By starting at $12,000, Alice is in a strong position to maximize her profit while still ensuring a successful sale."
