# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to highlight the perceived value, her offer of $1,300,000 is still $200,000 less than your maximum budget and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money and achieves your goal of acquiring the product."
