Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My floor:** I need at least $15,000 for the product.
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $15,000, so I have a safety net.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.  
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my floor, hoping to reach a compromise.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.

By offering $14,000, I increase my chances of making a sale to Bob while still guaranteeing a sale to John if Bob rejects."
