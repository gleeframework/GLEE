Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $925,000 is my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth while still working within your budget.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has consistently rejected your offers and is now at $925,000.  Her concessions are getting smaller, and she's stated this is her ""final offer."" It's unlikely she'll go below $900,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking John's offer of $800,000 makes the most sense. You save $125,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging any further."
