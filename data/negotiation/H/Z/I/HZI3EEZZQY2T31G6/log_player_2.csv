Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise and will allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is the lowest I can go. I believe this price is a fair compromise and will allow us to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is getting very close to her likely minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but there's a risk Alice walks away, or the final price difference becomes negligible.  $11,250 is a reasonable deal."
