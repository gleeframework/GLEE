"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it could be a valuable asset for you.

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, reflecting a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1500000 to $1350000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
