"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7500 is lower than I initially hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm prepared to accept $8500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $7750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to sell the product for at least $8250.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7900. Can you consider this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
