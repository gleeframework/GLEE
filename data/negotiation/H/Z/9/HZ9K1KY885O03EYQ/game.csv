"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I've placed on the product, while also being reasonable for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product. This would be a significant saving for me, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
