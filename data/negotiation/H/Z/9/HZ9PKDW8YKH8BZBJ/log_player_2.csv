Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is quite a distance from my original asking price.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 reflects that value more accurately. Let's bridge this gap. What do you think?
