"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a deal, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $95 is about as high as I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  If not, I might need to explore other options.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll meet you in the middle of my target and your offer, so how about $101.50?",101.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient, and I appreciate that. How about this - I'll offer you $97, and that's my final offer. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to get this deal done. What do you say?",97.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to meet you at a price that's closer to my target. How about $104?",104.0,Alice,9,
