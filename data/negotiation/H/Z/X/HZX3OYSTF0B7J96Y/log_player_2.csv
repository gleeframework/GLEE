"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than $10,500.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, her counteroffer is still above his budget. It's better to secure the product from John at his price rather than risk Alice rejecting any further counteroffers."
