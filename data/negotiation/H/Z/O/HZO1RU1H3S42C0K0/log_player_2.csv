# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a significant opportunity, as I am confident this product will generate a strong return on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts!

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is your maximum budget. You have no information on the product's value to Alice, meaning there's a chance she's willing to sell for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice or explore other options before settling for the full $15,000."
