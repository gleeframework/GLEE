Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you're placing on it, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1,500,000?

While I could push for more, accepting $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by pushing too hard."
