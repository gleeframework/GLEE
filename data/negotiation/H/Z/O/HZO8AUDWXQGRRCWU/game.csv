"I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $875000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
