"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to establish rapport and highlight the perceived value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $120, and I believe I can get closer to that price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to offer the product for $92. This is my final offer before I go with my other buyer."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
