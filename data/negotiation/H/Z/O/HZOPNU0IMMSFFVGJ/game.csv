,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $90 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to offer the product for $92. This is my final offer before I go with my other buyer.",92.0,Alice,5,
