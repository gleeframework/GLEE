"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a better deal than that, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I can see that you're willing to pay more than $8,000, so I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer on this price point, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
