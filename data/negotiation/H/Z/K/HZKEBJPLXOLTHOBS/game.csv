"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. How about $1400000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,,

I'm starting to think that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet your target. I'm now thinking of a price of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?,1600000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $1200000? I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,,
