"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
