{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,250 is quite close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to an even lower offer, or the possibility of him walking away, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
