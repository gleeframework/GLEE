Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's my reasoning:

* **Minimum Acceptable Offer:** I know John will pay $1,000,000, so anything above that is a win for me.
* **High Enough to Tempt:** $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but not so high that it's immediately outlandish. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By offering a higher price, I'm leaving room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to reach a mutually beneficial price.

**Important Notes:**

* I have no information about Bob's financial capacity or perceived value of the product. This offer is based purely on maximizing my profit with a known fallback option.
* I should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counter-offers."
