Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate.  Starting significantly higher allows you to potentially gain much more.
* **Justification:**  While a high price, framing it as ""exclusive"" and highlighting the ""value and potential"" can make it seem more appealing.
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Room to negotiate:** This high initial offer gives you room to come down in price if Bob negotiates, while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. Bob might be turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential reward of selling significantly above your minimum makes it a calculated risk worth considering."
