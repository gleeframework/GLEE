Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I need to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to try and get a higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,200,000. I want to keep trying to negotiate a higher price, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to your price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still not quite there.  I'm not ready to accept it yet. We're running out of rounds, so I'm going to counteroffer one more time to try to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,115,000. This is a very slight adjustment from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1115000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,105,000.  It's a fair price and I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,105,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We are running out of time (only two rounds left), and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid the risk of getting a lower price or the deal falling through completely, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it guarantees me my minimum and protects me from further negotiation."
