"Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to your price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,115,000. This is a very slight adjustment from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal before time runs out.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
