"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you don't know her value for the product, so it's risky.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open."
