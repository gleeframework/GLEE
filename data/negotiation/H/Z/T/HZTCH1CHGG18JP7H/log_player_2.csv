**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget. This signals my serious intent to negotiate, but also leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise, given that her initial offer was so high."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
