"Thanks Alice, that's a great price, but unfortunately it's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it right now.  Let me know what you think!",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $9000 for this product.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering you were asking for $15000 originally.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about we try $10000?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting a little frustrated here. We've been going back and forth for a while, and we're still quite far apart.  I really want to buy this product from you, but I'm not willing to go higher than $9500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is my minimum price. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",10000.0,Alice,9,
