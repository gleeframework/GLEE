"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference at $150? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move the product without losing too much.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $135? It's a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  $135 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile, but I'm willing to go down to $140. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $137. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",137.0,Bob,6,
