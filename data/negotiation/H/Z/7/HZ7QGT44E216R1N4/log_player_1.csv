"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $950,000. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  My message highlights the product's potential value for Bob, framing the price as a reflection of that. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message ends with a call for further discussion, signaling my willingness to compromise.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it still falls short of the $800,000 threshold I've set for myself. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, considering his willingness to buy and the fact that the product is worth $1,000,000 to him.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit than I could potentially achieve with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to get a more favorable price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fair Deal Framing:** I'm positioning my counteroffer as a fair solution that benefits both parties. 

By offering a compromise and emphasizing fairness, I aim to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting my counteroffer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's close this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 threshold I've set. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and avoid settling for a price that's below my minimum. 

I'll continue the negotiation in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price that's closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your offer while ensuring I can meet my minimum requirement. I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a smaller compromise than the previous one, showing that I'm taking his offer seriously but still holding out for a price closer to my target.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm repeating the message that the price reflects the value for both parties to further emphasize its worth. 
* **Finality:** This offer hints at a willingness to close the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be the sweet spot to get a final agreement, as it balances my need to reach my minimum with a potential for a quicker close."
