Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  My final offer is $712,500. If you can't agree to that, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 712500}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $712,500. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely we'll get Alice below $725,000. She's holding firm and even threatening to go with John (although that might be a bluff). Accepting now secures a reasonable price."
