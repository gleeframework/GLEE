"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  While I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I want to leave room for some back-and-forth. I have John as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the product's true value for me. I believe I can negotiate a better price, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing Bob as a buyer if it means getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  I believe this is still a fair price given the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000, and I'm not desperate to sell at this point.  It's worth pushing further and seeing if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Hopefully, this offer will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still push for a bit more. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and I don't want to sell it for significantly less than that. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a smaller concession than my previous offer, but I believe it is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob.  We are very close to a deal, and I want to make sure I am getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We are getting very close to a deal, and I am determined to get as close as possible to $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get Bob to agree to a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9

This is my final offer. It's time to be firm and hold out for the price I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer.  If he rejects it, I'll go with John."
