Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good price for my product.  I know Bob values it at $100, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, especially since I know John is willing to pay $100.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise that's still within my desired range and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It seems Bob is not willing to go higher than $95, which is less than my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit."
