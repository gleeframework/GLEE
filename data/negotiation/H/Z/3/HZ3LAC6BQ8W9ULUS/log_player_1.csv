"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. To kick off negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value (""significant value"") without explicitly revealing its worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This high initial offer allows ample space for Bob to counter and for a back-and-forth negotiation to occur.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to acquire the product.
2. **Establish a strong position:**  Starting high can sometimes make the buyer more agreeable to a lower (but still profitable) counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value ($800,000), it's still significantly below both your minimum ($1,000,000) and your initial asking price.  Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but maintaining a firm stance above our $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value while emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Pressure Point:** By decreasing the price by a significant amount, we're subtly putting pressure on Bob to counter with a more substantial offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds our minimum threshold of $1,000,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better deal. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
