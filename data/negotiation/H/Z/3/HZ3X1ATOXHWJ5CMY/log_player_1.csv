"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and sets the initial expectation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being friendly and inviting to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Remember:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so if the negotiation doesn't go well, I have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $100, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, considering your interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but staying above my minimum.  
* **Maintaining value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and why $105 is a fair price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging.

**Goal:**  I'm aiming for a quick resolution while securing a price that's close to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid the risk of running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $100.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation. It allows me to secure a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
