Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a premium price of $19,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and think you'll find it highly beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob only values the product at $10,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification for price:** By mentioning a ""premium price"" and highlighting the product's value, you aim to frame the offer in a positive light. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussion, allowing Bob to potentially counter-offer and meet somewhere closer to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This offer assumes you don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, a lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Risk tolerance:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer. However, you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
