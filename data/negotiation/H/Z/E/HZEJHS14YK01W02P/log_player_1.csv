Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000), increasing the likelihood of him accepting.

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can potentially negotiate a final price closer to my desired value.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,450,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially achieve a higher sale price and maximize my profit. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $1,400,000. Here's why:

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to lower my initial price slightly, showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Still Profitable:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price and offers me a good profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially push him closer to my desired price.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is very close to my desired price, and it's a good deal for me.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Bob will either walk away or continue to offer lower prices. 

Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profitable outcome. The potential for a higher price is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal."
