Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $6,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can do $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $8,200, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price of $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation is highly likely to result in a price higher than John's offer, and could even result in Alice raising her price further. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
