Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is really interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a compromise. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for a much lower offer."
