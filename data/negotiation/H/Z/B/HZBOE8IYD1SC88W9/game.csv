"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you far outweighs the price. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a lesser amount.  I'm confident you'll see the potential and seize this opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
