"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save money, and Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A counteroffer significantly lower than the initial price shows your intent to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Reduction:** $100 is a 17% reduction from Alice's asking price,  which is a reasonable starting point for a negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got some costs associated with this product, and $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but you still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** By seeing if Alice is willing to budge further, you can determine how much wiggle room you have.
* **Potentially Lower the Price:**  Even if Alice is firm on $110, a counteroffer might push her to reconsider, or at least provide a better understanding of her minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $110 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $105.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you are willing to compromise but still holding firm.
* **Justified Offer:** $105 is still a good price for you, and you're framing it as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Openness to Compromise:** The message again keeps the door open for discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $108, which is a bit above your last offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:**  Alice has come down to $108, which is a $12 savings from her initial offer and only $3 more than your last counteroffer.
* **Time Factor:** With 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the effort. 
* **Close to Your Goal:** $108 is relatively close to your desired price point of $100.
* **Avoid Risk:**  There's a risk of Alice becoming more stubborn or even increasing her offer if you reject.

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and the risk of losing a good deal is higher."
