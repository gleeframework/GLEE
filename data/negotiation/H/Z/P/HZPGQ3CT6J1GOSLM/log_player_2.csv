"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I believe this offer represents a fair price given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price, closer to her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice came down $1,000, so she's showing some willingness to move. Let's see if we can get her a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, $9,500 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference from the previous round and sets a firm but fair price.  It's important to show we're willing to negotiate but also have a limit."
