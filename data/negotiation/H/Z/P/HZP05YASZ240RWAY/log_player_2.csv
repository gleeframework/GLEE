Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
The price is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a slightly lower price, but there's a risk that they won't reach an agreement, and Bob will end up with nothing."
