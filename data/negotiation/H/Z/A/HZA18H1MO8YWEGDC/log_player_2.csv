Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a significant improvement, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $980,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate further and save more. He has room to counter-offer and hopefully close the gap."

Bob should buy from John.  While Alice's offer of $970,000 is tempting, Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice is unlikely to budge further.  Buying from John at $800,000 saves Bob a significant amount of money and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
