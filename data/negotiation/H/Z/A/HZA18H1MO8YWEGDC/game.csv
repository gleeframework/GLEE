"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'll meet you at $980,000, which is still a great deal for you and a fair profit for me. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit.  $980,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $960,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This deal will save you time and effort, and allows me to get the product within my budget.  Let's seal the deal at this price.",960000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you and a fair profit for me. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,7,
