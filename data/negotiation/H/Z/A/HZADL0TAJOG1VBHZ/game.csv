"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. That's the best I can do for now.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $875,000 is still a little low, but I'm willing to come down to $890,000 as a final compromise.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
