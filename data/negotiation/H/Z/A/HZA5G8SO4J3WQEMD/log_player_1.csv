Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quicker at $11,500 might be preferable for Alice. This offer balances speed and potential for higher profit."
