"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
