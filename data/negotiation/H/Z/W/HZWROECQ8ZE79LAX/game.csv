"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still leave a good profit margin for you, and it's a much better price for me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
