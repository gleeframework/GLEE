"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you while still exceeding my minimum asking price.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This still provides you with a significant saving compared to the product's value to you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
