Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you while still exceeding my minimum asking price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This still provides you with a significant saving compared to the product's value to you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount more than selling to John, and the negotiation process has taken a few rounds already.  I think it's time to close the deal."
