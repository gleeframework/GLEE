Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value to encourage Bob to accept the higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. I can always decrease the price, moving closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
