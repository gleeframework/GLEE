Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $125. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.
