Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a relatively aggressive offer, aiming to maximize profit. It's a gamble: 

* **If Bob values the product at over $15,000:** He'll accept, and you'll get a great deal.
* **If Bob values the product between $12,000 and $15,000:**  He'll likely reject, but you have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 

By starting high, you leave room to potentially negotiate downwards if Bob shows interest but not at your initial price."
