{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
