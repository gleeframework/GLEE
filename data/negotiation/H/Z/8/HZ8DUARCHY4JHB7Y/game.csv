"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make this work. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a discount, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get close to the value you have in mind. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
