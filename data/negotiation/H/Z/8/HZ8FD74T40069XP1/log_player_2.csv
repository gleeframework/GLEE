"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John."
