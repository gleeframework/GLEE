"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $135 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'm happy with the deal."
