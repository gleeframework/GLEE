"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. While it's worth significantly more to me, I believe this price reflects its value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you decline, I will be selling it to another interested party for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
