"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $115 is still more than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum price. It shows a willingness to negotiate, but also leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still not ideal. Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to negotiate a lower price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $107.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's latest offer.  I believe it's a reasonable middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm concerned that I'm nearing the end of the rounds and might end up paying more to John if I don't accept this offer. It's best to close the deal and secure the product within my budget."
