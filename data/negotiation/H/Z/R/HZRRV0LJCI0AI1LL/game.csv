"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
