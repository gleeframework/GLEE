"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $90 from John, and you're only willing to pay $100.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a better price from her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $92. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. You're only willing to pay $100, and you can buy the product from John for that price. You're not willing to pay more than $100, so you should continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $91 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $88. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $90. I think the product is worth every penny, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. How about we meet in the middle again at $89.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $89.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.75?  I'm hoping we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $89. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $89.25? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've been negotiating with Alice for a while, and you're getting closer to your target price, but Alice is still unwilling to go lower than $89.25. Since you're only willing to pay $100 and you can buy the product from John for that price, it makes sense to just buy it from John.  There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a better price from Alice, and continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort."
