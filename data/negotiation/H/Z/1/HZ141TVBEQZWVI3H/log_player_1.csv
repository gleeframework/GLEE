Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($120) gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Slight Discount Psychology:**  Offering a small discount ($1 off) might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though the price is still significantly higher than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's budget or how much he values the product, you could potentially adjust your offer for a better outcome."
