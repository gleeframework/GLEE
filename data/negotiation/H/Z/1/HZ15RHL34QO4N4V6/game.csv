"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? This is still a fantastic price for you, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,250?  This would be a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for the product.",13250.0,Bob,4,
