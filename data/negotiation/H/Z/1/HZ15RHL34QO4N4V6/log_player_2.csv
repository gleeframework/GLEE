"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? This is still a fantastic price for you, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $13,500 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. He has more room to negotiate, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,250?  This would be a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}
