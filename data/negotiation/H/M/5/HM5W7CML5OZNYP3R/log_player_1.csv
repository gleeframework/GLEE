""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no benefit to potentially engaging in further negotiation with Bob when I can secure the full value with John."
