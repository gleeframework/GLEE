"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 70. How about we meet in the middle at 90? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $75 for the product. This is the best I can do.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below 85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth the extra 10. How about we meet again at 85?",85.0,Alice,5,
