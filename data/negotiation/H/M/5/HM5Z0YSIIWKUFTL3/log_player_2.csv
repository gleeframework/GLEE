(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but I want to see if I can get it even lower. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will allow me to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a good price, I believe I can still negotiate further and get it lower. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  $375,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating but still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to come up on her price. I'm happy to accept $425,000 as it's within my budget and a good deal compared to the initial price and John's offer.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching a stalemate or losing the deal entirely.  It's time to secure the product."
