"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen, and I believe you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  You value the product at $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. This means you would save $400,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Better than buying from John:**  Even though Alice's offer is not the lowest possible price, it is still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000."
