"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer provides room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value.
* **John as Backup:**  While we aim for a higher price with Bob, we keep in mind the guaranteed $800,000 offer from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask and his perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. We are confident we can reach a better deal than John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It seems we have some ground to cover. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,000,000, we're proposing a compromise that meets Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and our previous ask ($1,100,000). 
* **Justification:** We're reinforcing the product's value while acknowledging Bob's concerns, making the offer more palatable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us well above John's $800,000 offer while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, and Bob is clearly interested.  While $950,000 is getting closer to acceptable, we still have negotiating room and rounds available. A counteroffer slightly above John's price will keep Bob engaged while pushing for a higher final number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. Let's make this happen â€“ how about $975,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and it reflects my desire to see you benefit from it."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($25,000 instead of $50,000) to signal we're reaching our lower limit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value and frames the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Time Consideration:**  As we progress through the rounds, proposing a price closer to our bottom line while still exceeding John's offer ($800,000) becomes increasingly important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $925,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, and I believe it's worth exploring further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, Bob's offer of $925,000 is reasonably close to our previous counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer. Further haggling might yield only minor increases at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the deal falling through entirely. Accepting now secures a substantial profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own value, allowing us to move on to other opportunities."
