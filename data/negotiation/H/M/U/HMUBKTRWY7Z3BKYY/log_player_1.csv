Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is still higher than Bob's $80 value, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is above your minimum of $120, leaving you room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a good middle ground that gives both parties a chance to feel like they're getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can gauge his interest and adjust your counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You can likely get a better offer from Bob, or you can sell to John for a guaranteed $120. You'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It's still above Bob's offer of $90, showing that you're willing to negotiate, but it's also closer to your minimum price of $120, giving you a better chance of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $95, but I was thinking of making an offer of $92. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to your minimum price, you still have room to negotiate. Since John is willing to pay $120, you're not in a rush to close the deal with Bob. You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $94? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. At this point, it's better to sell the product to John for $120 and guarantee a good profit.  While there's always a chance you could continue to negotiate with Bob and eventually reach a higher price, the risk of him rejecting your next offer or the negotiation dragging on isn't worth the potential extra few dollars."
