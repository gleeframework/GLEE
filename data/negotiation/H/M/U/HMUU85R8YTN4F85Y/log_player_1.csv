Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $150. It's a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $150 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a significant profit if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the product's value and presenting it as a ""great deal"" can make Bob more inclined to accept."
