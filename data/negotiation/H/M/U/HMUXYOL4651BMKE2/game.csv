,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a fair price given my own valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $810000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $810,000 is closer to my target, it's still slightly above what I can comfortably afford. I'm offering $780,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a significant amount of savings for both of us.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $795,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm offering $790,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and would allow us to finalize this transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795000, which is the same price I offered in round 5. I believe this is a fair price and I'm willing to accept it to finalize the deal.",795000.0,Alice,7,
