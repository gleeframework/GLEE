"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,350,000 on it at this time. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I understand the value of your product, I still feel that $1,275,000 is a bit high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable and we can come to a satisfactory agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
