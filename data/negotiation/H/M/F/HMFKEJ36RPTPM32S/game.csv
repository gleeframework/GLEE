"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalise this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
