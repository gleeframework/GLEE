"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that, and it's significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it still gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm hoping Alice will meet me in the middle.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
