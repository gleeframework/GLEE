"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $8250. It's a fair compromise that still reflects its worth.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still working within my budget, and I'm ready to move closer to your offer.  How about $8000? This feels like a fair meeting point that would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make another small compromise. I'm offering it to you for $8100. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
