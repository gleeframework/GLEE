Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is above my minimum value of $150, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm countering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, which might make him more likely to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll counter Bob's offer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is my final offer, and it's still above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not going to meet my price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150. While not my ideal outcome, it's still above my minimum and ensures I don't waste more time negotiating."
