Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you proposed is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we agree on a price of $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We are closer to John's price, but continued negotiation with Bob might yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer serves several purposes:

* **Strong Negotiation:**  It shows Bob we are serious about reaching a deal but won't budge below a certain point.
* **Clean Number:** The $1,000,000 mark is psychologically impactful and may make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating it's our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept rather than risk losing the deal entirely."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your consideration, Alice. I appreciate your effort in adjusting your offer. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we're still slightly below our ideal price, accepting Bob's offer at $980,000 makes the most sense now for a few key reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to net us significantly more. Bob is clearly demonstrating his budget limitations.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Closing the deal now provides immediate capital. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a chance Bob might walk away entirely if we push further, leaving us to start over with another buyer.

Accepting $980,000 ensures a good profit, avoids potential negotiation fatigue, and allows us to move forward quickly."
