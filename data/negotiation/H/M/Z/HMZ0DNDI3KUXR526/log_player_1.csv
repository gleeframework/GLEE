Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This gives him a good deal as he values it at $150, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my preferred price, but still above my minimum. I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $135. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my preferred price that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
