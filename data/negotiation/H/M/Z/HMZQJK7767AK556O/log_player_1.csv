I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm adjusting my price down a bit, but still trying to get a profit.  I'm willing to come down a little more to see if we can reach a deal, but I'm not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, but if he rejects it again, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground.  I'm still hopeful of getting a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also aware that John is a safe option if negotiations break down."
