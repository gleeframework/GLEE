Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and makes it more enticing for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially landing me an even better deal."
