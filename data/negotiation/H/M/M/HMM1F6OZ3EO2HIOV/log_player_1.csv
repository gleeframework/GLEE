Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think it would be very valuable to you, even more so than my standard price."",
""product_price"": 99 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100, Alice should aim to get more than that from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is a strong tactic. It's just slightly below John's offer, creating a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, subtly suggesting it's worth even more than the offered price. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit while maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
