Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,600 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 at this point. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still aiming for $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,850?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a very reasonable price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9850}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,700 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000.  I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still get closer to my target price with some strategic negotiation."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $9800. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price closer to my desired $12,000. While Bob's offer of $9,800 is the highest he's offered so far, it's still below my minimum threshold.  To avoid risking a complete loss of profit, I will accept the guaranteed $12,000 offer from John."
