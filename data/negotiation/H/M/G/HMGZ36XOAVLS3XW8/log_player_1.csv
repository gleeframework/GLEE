Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you're in a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""benefits"" creates perceived value, justifying the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's perspective, leaving room for discussion and potential counter-offers.

This strategy aims to either secure a higher profit from Bob or lead you back to your comfortable baseline offer from John."
