Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** $100 is more than my minimum price of $80, so I'm making a profit. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $100 is still significantly less than the value the product holds for Bob ($120), making it a good deal for him.
* **It reduces the risk of rejection:** By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John for a lower price."
