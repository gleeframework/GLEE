Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm conveying that I'm flexible and willing to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay, while still having a backup option with John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. However, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay $10,000.  Since I'm not motivated to negotiate further and risk getting a lower offer from Bob, I'm choosing to sell the product to John immediately."
