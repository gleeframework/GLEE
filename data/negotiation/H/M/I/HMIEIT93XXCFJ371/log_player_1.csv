Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price a bit, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  If he's serious about buying, he might be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my last offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale."
