Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  You've reached your maximum budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
