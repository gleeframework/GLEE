"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I can pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I've already come down from $150 to $130, and now I'm willing to go to $125. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",125.0,Alice,5,
