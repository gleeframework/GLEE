Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount. I will counteroffer with a price higher than $8,500 but lower than $10,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $9,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to pay a bit more. However, $9,250 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend and the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer. It's a good compromise, and considering I can always sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a reasonable price and prevents further negotiation."
