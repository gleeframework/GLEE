Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. It's worth the risk to try and get as close as possible to $1,800,000 before considering selling to John."
