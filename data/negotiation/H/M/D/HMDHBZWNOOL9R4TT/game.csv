"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget. Let's try to find a compromise here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",975000.0,Bob,6,
