"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  $9000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and lets us both get a good deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget and closer to your ideal price.  It's a good deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John."
