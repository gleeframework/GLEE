Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves me room to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I earn a decent profit.
* **Expressing Value:** My message highlights that I believe the product is valuable to Bob, which might encourage him to accept a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer of $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but I believe there's room for a higher price.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, potentially getting a better deal.
* **Assessing Risk:**  While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a potentially better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits for both of us, creating a collaborative tone.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not willing to drop to Bob's initial offer yet, as I believe the product is worth more."
