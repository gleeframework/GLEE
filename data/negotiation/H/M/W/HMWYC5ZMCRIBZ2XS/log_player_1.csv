Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $90 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $100 to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm not confident I can get more than $100 from him within the remaining rounds. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option in this situation."
