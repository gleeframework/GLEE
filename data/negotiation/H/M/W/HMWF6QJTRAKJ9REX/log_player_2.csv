# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John is willing to sell at. It makes much more sense to see if you can negotiate with Alice or go directly to John."
