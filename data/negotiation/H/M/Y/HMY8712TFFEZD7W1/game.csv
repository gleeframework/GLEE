"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be useful for me, but $14,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for the value this product provides. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, I need a price that reflects its true worth. Would you consider $11,800? That's my final offer.",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's your final offer, but I'm afraid $11,800 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
