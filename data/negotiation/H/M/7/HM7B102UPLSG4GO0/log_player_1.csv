Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open Ended:** I'm not pressuring Bob for an immediate decision, allowing for potential counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm not desperate for a sale, and John is a guaranteed buyer at a much better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob, trying to close the gap while still securing a reasonable profit. My goal is to get as close to John's offer as possible without risking a deal with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to help justify my price. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting that $1,200,000 might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to consider.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* **Reject:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to weigh the risks of further negotiation against John's guaranteed offer. I'll likely make one more counteroffer at $1,300,000 before accepting John's offer."
