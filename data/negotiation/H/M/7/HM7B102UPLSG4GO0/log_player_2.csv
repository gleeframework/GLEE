"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price.  It's always worth exploring options to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is still a better price than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point."
