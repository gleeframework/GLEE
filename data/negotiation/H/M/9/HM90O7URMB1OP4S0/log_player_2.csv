"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point. This shows I'm serious about the product, but also willing to walk away if the price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but it shows she's willing to negotiate.  There's still room to push for a lower price, so I'll reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to still get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's a compromise, closer to her previous offer, but still within my desired range. This shows a willingness to meet her halfway while still trying to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're a shrewd negotiator! I like the way you think, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a bit more. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I can still try to get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $10,000.  There's a chance that she might be willing to drop her price a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would allow us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our current positions, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. This price is still below my maximum budget, and it's a fair compromise that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I like the way you're thinking! Meeting in the middle at $10,750 is a great idea. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to give up on the extra $250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you a price of $11,250, which is still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $11,250 is still above my preferred budget.  Considering that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation and I'm only two rounds away from my default option, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
