Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price ($150) allows you to potentially earn the most profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can gradually lower the price towards his perceived value ($100).
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for your minimum price. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
