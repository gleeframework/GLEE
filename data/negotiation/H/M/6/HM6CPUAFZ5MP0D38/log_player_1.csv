"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,300,000, we establish a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets the stage for subsequent offers to seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our starting point and our minimum acceptable price. Bob's counteroffer indicates willingness to negotiate, but we have room to push for a better deal.  We'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession of $200,000 from our initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're not dropping below the $2,000,000 mark yet. We want to signal that we're still aiming for a price significantly higher than his initial counteroffer. 
* **Reiteration of Value:** The message continues to emphasize the product's ""unique benefits"" to justify the high price, even with the concession. 

We're aiming to create a sense of urgency while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which is a good sign. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly below our desired range. We're willing to negotiate further, but we need to push Bob closer to the $2,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm offering a final price of $2,000,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe in the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear that this is our best price and a firm offer. This can create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Justification:** We're shifting the focus slightly by acknowledging it's a significant investment for Bob while reiterating the value it will bring him.
* **Walking Away Point:** We're getting close to our absolute minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, we'll likely need to seriously consider John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your efforts in reaching a compromise. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I hope this offer is acceptable and allows us to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob is now at $1,950,000. While not our ideal price, it's only $50,000 away from our ""final offer.""  The difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Invested:**  We've spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids potentially protracted back-and-forth that might not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer provides a $450,000 premium. 

It's time to close the deal and secure a very good price for the product."
