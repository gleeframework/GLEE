"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $12,000. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He can try to get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $16,000 is still too high for me. How about $14,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 14000}
