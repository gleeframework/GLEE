"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given the market value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about my bottom line. To make this work, I can't go any lower than $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
