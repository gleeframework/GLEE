"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-friendly, but $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to try and meet you halfway.  Do you think that could work?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $815,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product. How about we settle this right now at $800,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,8,
