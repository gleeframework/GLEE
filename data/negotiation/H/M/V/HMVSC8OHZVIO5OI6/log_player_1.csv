"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Guiding with a minimum:** By mentioning my minimum expectation of $150, I set a baseline and indicate that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Openness:**  The phrase ""open to offers"" invites Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer, starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum of $120.  While it's tempting to accept, doing so would mean I'm losing money and potentially missing out on a better offer.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  I'm optimistic that we can find a middle ground. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's responses.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to go down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $130? It's still a good deal for a product worth much more.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's lower than my initial price but still above my minimum, showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Reframing the value:** I highlight that the product is ""worth much more"" to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I keep the message friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, especially with only 6 rounds remaining.
* **Time is a factor:**  With limited rounds, I can't afford to be overly picky.  Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** I still have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob completely breaks down, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
