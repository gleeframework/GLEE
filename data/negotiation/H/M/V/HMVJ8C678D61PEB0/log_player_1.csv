"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and show confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
