"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels more reasonable to me."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This gives room to bargain and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While I want to save money, offering an extremely low price (like half) could be insulting and make Alice less likely to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a significant profit for her.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's fair for me as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved closer to my price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** While $1,250,000 is better, it's still above my ideal price. I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Time on My Side:** We have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that isn't great for me."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're moving closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting the midpoint between our last offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Steady Progress:** This continues the trend of lowering the price, keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction.
* **Maintaining Respect:** The tone remains cordial and professional, which is essential for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,225,000?  This is a fair compromise that still gives you a significant discount from your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's concessions are getting smaller. This suggests she might be nearing her bottom line. 
* **Potential for More:** While $1,225,000 is tempting, I still believe there's room for her to go lower, even if it's just a little bit.
* **Calculated Risk:** We're past the halfway point, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if needed."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You're right, we're getting close. To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a very fair price."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a slightly larger jump in price this round to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Matching Her Value:** I know $1,200,000 is her actual value for the product. Offering this price puts the ball in her court and makes it harder for her to justify a higher price.
* **Deadline Approaching:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation.  This offer is my attempt to secure the best possible deal before I need to consider John's offer seriously."
