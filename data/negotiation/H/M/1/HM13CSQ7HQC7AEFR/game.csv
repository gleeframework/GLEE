"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels more reasonable to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's fair for me as well.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're moving closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,225,000?  This is a fair compromise that still gives you a significant discount from your initial assessment.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You're right, we're getting close. To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a very fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
