"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price, considering the market value and my own limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond the standard market considerations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the unique value of this product, $1,900,000 remains far too steep for me.  I'm prepared to increase my offer to $950,000, reflecting a significant compromise on my part.  This price is reasonable given its potential benefits and aligns with my budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, while still acknowledging the inherent value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product, a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise given the product's value and my financial limitations. I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial and allows us to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
