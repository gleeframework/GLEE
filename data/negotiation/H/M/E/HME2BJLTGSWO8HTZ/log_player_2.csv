"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm sure you'll find it to be a very worthwhile investment. Please consider this offer carefully.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice, getting closer to her $800,000 valuation."
