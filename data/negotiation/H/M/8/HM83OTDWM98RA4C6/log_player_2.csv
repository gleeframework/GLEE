It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for a better price than buying it from John."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Alice will be more willing to negotiate at this price point."

I'm offering Alice $1,000,000, which is the price I can get from John.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to go higher."
