"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting the potential I see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  It offers significant upside potential that I'm confident you recognize.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your approach to this negotiation.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,425,000. I believe this recognizes the product's true worth while leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,425,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
