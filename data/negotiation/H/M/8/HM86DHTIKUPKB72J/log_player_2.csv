"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $110 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still a good deal for Alice (higher than her valuation of $100) and offers Bob a potential $5 saving compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $117 is only $2 more than Bob's counteroffer of $110.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept.  Any further negotiation might not result in a lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to hold firm at $117."
