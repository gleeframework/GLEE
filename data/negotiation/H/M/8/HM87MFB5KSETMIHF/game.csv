"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not comfortable going below $13,000.  Would you consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but that's my final offer.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,500 is close, I'm trying to stay closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
