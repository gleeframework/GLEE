Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I can go up to $1,425,000.  That's a strong offer and demonstrates how serious I am about acquiring this product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a number significantly higher than his current offer of $1,425,000.  Continuing the negotiation has a downside risk, as Bob might not reach our desired price point. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it the most logical decision at this point."
