``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in the higher price range.  I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone to try to build a good relationship with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, recognizing your interest in the product.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is still too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and a fair price for the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Given the limited time, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000."
