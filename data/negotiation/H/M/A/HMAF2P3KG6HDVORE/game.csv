"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $150? I'm sure you'll still get great value for your money.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $130 is closer, but still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle again at $140. This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. ",140.0,Alice,5,
