Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're making a good profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond. 

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $900,000 for your product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than the $1,000,000 price point I initially proposed.  I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within my desired price range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize its worth.
* **Positive Language:**  The language is friendly and open to continue the negotiation. 

By offering $950,000, I'm aiming for a middle ground that is closer to my initial offer and potentially more enticing for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I respect your valuation of the product. However, I believe we can still find common ground. I am willing to pay $925,000 for your product. This price is higher than my initial offer and closer to your proposal, while still being within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still less than my desired price of $950,000, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer of $900,000.  It's also only $25,000 away from my last offer, which indicates that we are nearing an agreement.  

Considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option. It ensures a higher sale price compared to selling to John, and it avoids the potential for a lengthy negotiation process that might not lead to a better outcome."
