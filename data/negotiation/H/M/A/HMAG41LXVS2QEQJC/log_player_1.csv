I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $13,500.  This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's a better deal for me, and I can guarantee the sale."
