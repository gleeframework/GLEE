"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer demonstrates his seriousness while also setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of that, I would like to counteroffer at $11,500 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while respecting both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his limit.  He has already made a counteroffer and Alice has rejected it, indicating a potential for further negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach this round. He's narrowing the gap by only offering a $500 decrease from Alice's counteroffer.  This shows his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. To move forward, I propose a price of $10,800 for the product. This price respects both our interests and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is very close to Bob's limit, he can still potentially get a better deal. Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and Bob should continue trying to drive the price down. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a deal closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to go up to $10,700 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now only $700 above his desired price point. This counteroffer demonstrates his serious intent to close the deal, while still pushing for a lower price.  The message also emphasizes the closeness of their positions, making it more likely Alice will accept."
