"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm still willing to negotiate with him, but I need a higher price to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's keep this negotiation going."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a better deal for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price in the future."
