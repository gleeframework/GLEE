"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price and still gives you a good value.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's keep this negotiation going.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
