,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair considering your asking price.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more than my minimum.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $120?  That's my absolute maximum, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
