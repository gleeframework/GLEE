Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $8,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price and has indicated this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go below $8,000, especially with her ""minimum acceptable price"" being stated as $9,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John for $8,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
