Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in your product,  $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to move forward quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but there's a significant gap between $850,000 and what I consider a fair price. This product has garnered strong interest from other potential buyers.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'm willing to push him a little further, especially since I have the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be candid, I have other interested buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach a deal. I'm willing to accept $925,000.  This offer stands as a final concession from my side."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for this product. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems stuck at $900,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a real risk of him walking away or the negotiations dragging on. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a significant amount over Bob's offer. It makes more financial sense to take the sure thing at this point."
