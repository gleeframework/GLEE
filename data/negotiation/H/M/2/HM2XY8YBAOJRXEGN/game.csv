"Alice, while I see the potential in your product,  $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to move forward quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but there's a significant gap between $850,000 and what I consider a fair price. This product has garnered strong interest from other potential buyers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. I believe this reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
