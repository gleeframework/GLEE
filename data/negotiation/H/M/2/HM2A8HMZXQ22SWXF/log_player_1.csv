Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer, my goal is to maximize my profit.  I need to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $1250000. Can you consider this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through five rounds of negotiation and it's not clear that we'll reach an agreement.  Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob, I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
