"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my bottom line.  This is fair considering the product's value, and I hope you'll agree.",12000.0,Alice,5,
