"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, recognizing the immense value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
