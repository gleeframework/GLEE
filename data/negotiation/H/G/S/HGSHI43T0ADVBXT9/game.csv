"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $107.50? That's the best I can do at this point.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're trying to save as much as possible, and I respect that.  $107.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $110? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,5,
