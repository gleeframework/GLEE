"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise here.",135.0,Alice,3,
