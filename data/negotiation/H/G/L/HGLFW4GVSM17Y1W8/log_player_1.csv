Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, even at a slightly lower value than your initial assessment. It's a great opportunity to acquire it at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $15,000 to John, there's a chance to earn a higher profit by negotiating with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is still a significant profit margin for me (above my minimum of $15,000). This price might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, as it's closer to his perceived value.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays and ensures immediate revenue. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a higher profit outweighs the risk of losing this sale in this scenario."
