"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
