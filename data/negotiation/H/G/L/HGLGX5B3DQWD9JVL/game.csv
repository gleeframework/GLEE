"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
