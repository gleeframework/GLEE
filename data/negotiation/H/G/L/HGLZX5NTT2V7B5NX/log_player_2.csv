"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. If not, I have other interested parties waiting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $8,000. I'd rather buy the product from John for $8,000.
