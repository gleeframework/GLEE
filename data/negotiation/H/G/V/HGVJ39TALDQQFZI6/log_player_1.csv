Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that:
    * Provides you with a $150,000 profit margin.
    * Leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit while still securing a sale."
