"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $170 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $145. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred maximum of $120. You can likely negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to try and secure a deal closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm interested in the product, $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $138. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is still higher than your preferred maximum of $120. You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower than $138. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at $120.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate might lead to further delays or even a breakdown in the deal."
