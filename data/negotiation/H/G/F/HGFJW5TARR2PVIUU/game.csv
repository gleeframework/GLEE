"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm interested in the product, $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $138. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",138.0,Alice,5,
