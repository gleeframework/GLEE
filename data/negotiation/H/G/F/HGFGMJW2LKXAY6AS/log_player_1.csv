Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a significantly higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer again is high. At this point, selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further uncertainty."
