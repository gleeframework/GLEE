"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's currently valued at $10,000 for you, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what I would get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though it's a good deal for Alice, it's still over Bob's budget. He can get the product for $10,000 from John."
