"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1300000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and is a significant step closer to my initial price point. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1325000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and my original asking price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
