"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum of $1,000,000, you can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have room to negotiate because Alice values the product at $800,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* **Buying from John is the worst option:** It's the most expensive choice, and you haven't exhausted other options. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.
* **Mid-point:**  This offer is also a good starting point for negotiation because it's  halfway between Alice's value ($800,000) and my maximum ($1,000,000).
* **Room for compromise:** Alice still has room to make a profit, and I still have some leeway to increase my offer if necessary.

Let's see how Alice responds to my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is increasing:**  Instead of coming down, Alice has raised her price to $920,000. This suggests she's not very motivated to sell at a lower price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While her offer is getting closer to my maximum, I can still try to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still the worst option:**  The potential savings from negotiating with Alice are too significant to give up on.

By rejecting Alice's offer again, I can try another counteroffer to see if I can convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm only increasing my offer by $25,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to be pushed around. 
* **Staying below my limit:**  My offer is still significantly below my maximum of $1,000,000, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  I'm using this counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility. If she accepts, I've gotten a better deal. If she rejects, I can decide if I want to continue negotiating or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still not budging much:** While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly higher than my counteroffer. This indicates that she might not be willing to come down significantly.
* **I still have room to negotiate:**  I can still offer a lower price and try to reach a compromise.  The potential savings from getting a better deal with Alice are worth the effort.
* **Buying from John is still the worst option:**  It's too expensive, and I haven't exhausted all negotiation options with Alice. 

I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'll need to consider how much further I'm willing to increase my offer if Alice continues to reject my proposals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm getting closer to her price point.
* **Reaching a compromise:** I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Alice to consider accepting, as it's a good compromise between her asking price and my desired price.
* **Last chance:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely accept her next offer, as the potential savings are diminishing and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, but I believe it's my best chance to secure a favorable price for the product."
