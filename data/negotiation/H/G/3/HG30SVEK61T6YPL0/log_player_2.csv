"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a fair price, I can meet you halfway.  How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down to $100, which is within Bob's budget of $120.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or a failed deal. Accepting the offer at $100 is a good compromise, saving Bob $20 compared to buying from John."
