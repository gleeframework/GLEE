"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  I know you value it at $1,200,000, so this is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to sell for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair return on your investment, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my original offer. Can we do $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
