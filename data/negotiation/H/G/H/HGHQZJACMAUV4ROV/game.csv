"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still significantly below the product's true worth.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 - my absolute minimum.  This reflects the product's market value and ensures both of us get a fair deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
