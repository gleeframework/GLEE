This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Time pressure:**  You're running out of rounds, and Alice seems to be sticking close to this price point.
* **Savings:** You're still getting a $3,800 discount from John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to get the price lower might backfire, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price."
