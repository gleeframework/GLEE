"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $17000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $14000 for the product.

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'll make another counteroffer of $16000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",16000.0,Alice,5,
