Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation. By offering at $150, you might get lucky and Bob might accept without any haggling. Even if he counters, you're still in a good position to work your way down towards a price that's beneficial for you while staying above your $100 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($100).  This suggests he has room to negotiate upwards. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth. You can now make a counteroffer that brings the negotiation closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Compromise:** By coming down from $150 to $120, you show a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above your $100 minimum and closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Middle Ground:** Suggesting to ""meet in the middle"" frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room:** While closer to your goal, this counteroffer still leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to your minimum price, but you're still in a position to negotiate. He's moved from $80 to $90, showing he's willing to increase his offer. By rejecting and countering, you might be able to secure a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I can come down a bit further, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Could you do $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Minimum:** This counteroffer brings the price to your absolute minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Firmness:** By stating it's your ""final offer,"" you signal to Bob that you're unlikely to go any lower.  
* **Potential Acceptance:** Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a reasonable chance he'll accept this offer, giving you your desired outcome. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for the same price, ensuring you don't lose out."
