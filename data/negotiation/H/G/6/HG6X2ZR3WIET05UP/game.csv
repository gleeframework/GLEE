"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $90 is a good one, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $100 is a more reasonable price for this amazing product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $102. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable going above $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $102, which would be $101. Would you be willing to accept that?",101.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $101. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105. That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
