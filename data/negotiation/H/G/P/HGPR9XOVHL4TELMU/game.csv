"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can see we're getting closer.  How about we land at $1,280,000? This is a significant move on my part to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,280,000, which would be $1,265,000. That's my final offer.",1265000.0,Bob,6,
