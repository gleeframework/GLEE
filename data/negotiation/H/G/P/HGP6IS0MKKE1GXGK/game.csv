"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1500000 minus 5% discount, which would be $1425000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
