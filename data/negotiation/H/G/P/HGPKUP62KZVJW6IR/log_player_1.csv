Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit of $2,500.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Why this strategy?**

By starting with a slightly lower price, you are showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to negotiate.  This increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, you have room to increase the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $13,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly below your initial offer of $14,500. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap and reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer.  This will show Bob that you're willing to negotiate, while still protecting your profit margin."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,800, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13800}
