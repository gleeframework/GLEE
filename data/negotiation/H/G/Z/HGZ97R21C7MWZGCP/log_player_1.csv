"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm very interested in your product, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to land closer to $800000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, $800,000 is my minimum, and it's likely that if I reject his offer, we'll continue to go back and forth, and I might end up with less in the end.  It's important to know when to take a good deal."
