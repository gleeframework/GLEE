,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $11,000? I'm trying to be reasonable.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $11,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  I've got another buyer interested at a higher price, so I'm going to have to decline your offer.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,
