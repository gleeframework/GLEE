"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it'll be worth it for you in the long run. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to work from.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,200?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
