{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it'll be worth it for you in the long run. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to work from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,200?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is still a good deal for me. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is willing to buy it for $10,000."
