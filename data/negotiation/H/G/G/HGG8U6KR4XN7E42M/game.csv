"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $12,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
