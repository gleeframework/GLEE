"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you being upfront about your price. However, $9,500 is significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on $10,500.  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $10,250 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $10,750. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, and I appreciate your flexibility. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down one last time to $10,600. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down one last time, but $10,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?",10400.0,Bob,8,
