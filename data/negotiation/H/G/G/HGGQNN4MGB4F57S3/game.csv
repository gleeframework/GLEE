"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $7,500 is closer but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,750. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,200 is getting close.  How about we make it a deal at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is my last chance to make a deal, so I hope you can meet me halfway.",7100.0,Alice,7,
