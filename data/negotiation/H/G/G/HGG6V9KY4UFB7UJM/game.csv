"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my price.  How about $10,500? This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to be closer to $11,000. Let's meet halfway there.  How about $10,400?",10400.0,Alice,5,
