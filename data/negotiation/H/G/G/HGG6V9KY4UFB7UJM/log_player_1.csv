Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob or by selling to John."
