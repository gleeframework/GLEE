I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, but I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
