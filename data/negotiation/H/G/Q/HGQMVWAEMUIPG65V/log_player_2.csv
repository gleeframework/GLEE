"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a high-quality item valued at $100, and I believe you'll find this price very attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal.  You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $100.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $90 for the product?  This is a fair offer, considering the value you've placed on the product yourself."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. Let me propose a compromise at $92 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations and allows you to acquire the item you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is now within my budget of $100.  While I would still prefer to pay less, it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and I could end up paying the same amount to John."
