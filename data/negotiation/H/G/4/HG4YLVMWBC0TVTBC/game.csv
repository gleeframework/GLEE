"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to your operations. My initial price for it is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value a fair deal, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you while still being reasonable for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, I can't go lower than $1,050,000 at this point. This price is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's try to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
