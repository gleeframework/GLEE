You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims the market value is $10,000, you know you can get it for that price from John.  It's better to go with the guaranteed lower price."
