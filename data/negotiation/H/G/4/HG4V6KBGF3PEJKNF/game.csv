"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet closer to my initial offer,  say at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,180,000?  I believe that reflects the true value of this product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away.  I can go up to $1,160,000, but that's my final offer.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
