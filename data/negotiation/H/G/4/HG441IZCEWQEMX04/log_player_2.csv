Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,600.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice has come down significantly, the offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. He wants to see if he can push for a lower price.  He has 5 rounds left, so there is still time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping to close the deal at $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your guns, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go back to the $8,500 price point. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $8,650. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been persistent in trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice has also been firm in her counteroffers. While Alice's latest offer is only $150 more than Bob's ideal price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price. 

Given that Bob has only 3 rounds left, it's a calculated risk to continue negotiating.  Buying from John offers certainty and avoids potential further negotiation headaches. It's a better strategy to secure the product at Bob's target price rather than risk a higher price or a failed negotiation."
