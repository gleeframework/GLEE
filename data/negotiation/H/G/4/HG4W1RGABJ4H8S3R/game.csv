"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for a price closer to its perceived worth to me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This price reflects my assessment of the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think that $900000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $950000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
