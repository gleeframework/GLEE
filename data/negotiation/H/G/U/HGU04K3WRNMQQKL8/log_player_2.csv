Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your valuation, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

``` 
Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal. It's still below your maximum price, and you've already gotten her down from $1,100,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer again."
