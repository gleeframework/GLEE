"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your valuation, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
