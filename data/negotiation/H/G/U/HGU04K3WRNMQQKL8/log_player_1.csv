Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
