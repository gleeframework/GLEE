{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation and ensures that I won't lose out if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob."
