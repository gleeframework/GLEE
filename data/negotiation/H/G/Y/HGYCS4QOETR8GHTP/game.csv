"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for it.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",8000.0,Bob,4,
