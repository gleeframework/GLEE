"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $110 is still too high. There's room to negotiate for a better price, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, but one that's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to accept her initial price.  $95 is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Since I have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth rejecting this offer and seeing if I can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit too much. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of saving as much as possible, but I'm also being realistic. My offer of $100 is a compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  It's also important to remain polite and emphasize a fair price for both parties to keep the negotiation positive."
