"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $150, and John is selling the product for that exact amount, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting it allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John at the price you're comfortable with."
