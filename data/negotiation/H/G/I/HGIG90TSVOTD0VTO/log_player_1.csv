""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to capture as much of that profit margin as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation while having the safety net of John's offer."
