"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. To move this forward, I could consider $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
