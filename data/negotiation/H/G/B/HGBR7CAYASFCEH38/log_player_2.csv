"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable item that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still get the product from John, just for a slightly higher price."
