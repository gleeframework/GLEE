Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, indicating I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial asking price. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Exploring Options:** Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if I can get closer to my desired price range.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to potentially improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This takes into account the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Open to Finality:** The message leaves the door open for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is now very close to my target price, and I'm getting closer to my desired outcome.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might drop out completely or that I'll be unable to reach a better price in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids the potential loss of a better offer from John."
