"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer. My initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let's discuss!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's keep the negotiation going!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, and I believe this price is more reasonable. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this price is more reasonable. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal work. Let's settle for $1,010,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
