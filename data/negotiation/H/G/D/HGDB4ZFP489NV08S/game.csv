"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've indicated.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
