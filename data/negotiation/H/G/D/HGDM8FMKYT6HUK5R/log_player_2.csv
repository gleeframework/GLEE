"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,000 is a lower price than what John is offering. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** Bob has already made a counteroffer, and Alice has come down a bit. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price difference.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and decide to sell to someone else, leaving Bob with no product and having to pay John's higher price. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the best choice for Bob. He gets the product at a lower price than John's, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
