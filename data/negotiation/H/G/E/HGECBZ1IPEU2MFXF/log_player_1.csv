Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 120}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $90. Since $90 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my minimum price. Since Bob offered $90, I'll increase the price by $10 to $100. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 100}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
