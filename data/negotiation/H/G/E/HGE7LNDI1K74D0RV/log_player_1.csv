Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, there's space to potentially settle on a price higher than $80 (your minimum and John's offer).
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $100 is a common price point that might feel more palatable than, say, $95, even if the difference is minor.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $80, the risk is minimal."
