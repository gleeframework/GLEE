(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that space."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay right now.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There is still room for both of you to find a compromise."
