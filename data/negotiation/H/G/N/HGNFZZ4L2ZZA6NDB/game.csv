,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my max budget is $120.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? That way we both get a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $122, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!",122.0,Bob,4,
