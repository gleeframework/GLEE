"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice presents her offer as a fair deal, there's no incentive for you to accept it.  You can get the same price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might motivate her to propose a lower price in an attempt to avoid losing the sale."
