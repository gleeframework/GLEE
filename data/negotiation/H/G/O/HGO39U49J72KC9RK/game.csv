"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still a win for you, as it's well above what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
