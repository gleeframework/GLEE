This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but is still below my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't go that low. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800 was my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,200. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll counter with a slightly higher price than Bob's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go as low as $10,200.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350?  That's a fair price that's closer to both of our numbers."", ""product_price"": 10350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,350. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price I was originally offered by John. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is close to my minimum, it's not quite enough.  I'm not willing to go lower, and since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's better to sell to him and secure a guaranteed profit."
