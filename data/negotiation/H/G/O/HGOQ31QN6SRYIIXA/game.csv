"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a very good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
