Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob a chance to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Prioritizing John's offer:** If Bob rejects, I can immediately go to John and secure a sale for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm currently working within a budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. Accepting would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob.  While he's set a low bar, there's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially if he truly wants the product.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to try and sway him towards a higher price.
* **Maintaining a profit:** $9,000 is still above my minimum desired price, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not ideal.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price or taking too long. 
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price of $12,000, ensuring a good outcome."
