"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original price. How about we try $84? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",84.0,Alice,5,
