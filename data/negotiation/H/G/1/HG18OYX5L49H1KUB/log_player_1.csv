Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, as it's worth $100 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this worthwhile. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I think I can do $87.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is a better deal than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $89 is my final offer. It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a fair return. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we're very close to my bottom line of $80.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $88 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
