Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the fact that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $11,750. I'm thinking of a price of $12,200. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
