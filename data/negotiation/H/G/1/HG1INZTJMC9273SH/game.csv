"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer you $11,000. That's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget limitations.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I like the fact that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $11,750. I'm thinking of a price of $12,200. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",12200.0,Alice,7,
