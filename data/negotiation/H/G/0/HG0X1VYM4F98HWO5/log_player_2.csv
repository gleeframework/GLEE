"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since the product is worth $100 to you,  paying $120 is not a good deal. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $105, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. That's as close to $105 as I can get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.5 is a lot closer to my target price than Alice's previous offers, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to go with that option and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
