"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice's offer indicates she is willing to negotiate.  
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** This gives you the opportunity to set a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to save money.
* **Focus on finding a middle ground:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate further. This encourages Alice to engage and avoid outright rejection.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** $1,200,000 is still above Alice's minimum, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1200000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to accept $1300000.  This allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,300,000 is still under your maximum price point of $1,500,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise, showing her willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further rejection might lead to Alice being less willing to compromise in future rounds, or potentially rejecting all future counteroffers. 

By accepting, you secure a product you value at a price that fits your budget."
