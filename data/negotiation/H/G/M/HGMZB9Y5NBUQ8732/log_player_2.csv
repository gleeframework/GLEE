"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John wants $1,000,000. 
* **Bob wants to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer means Bob can buy the product for $100,000 less than he would pay John. 

Even though Bob could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, it's not guaranteed. Accepting her offer ensures he gets a good deal compared to the alternative."
