"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but  $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'd be happy to finalize the deal at $1000000.  This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and it's still a significant discount from my original offer. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
