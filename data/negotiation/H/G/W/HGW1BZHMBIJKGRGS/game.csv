"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to further discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm able to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept your final offer of $1,000,000. I'm still holding out for a better price, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
