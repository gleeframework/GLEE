Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's potential, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your previous offer of $1,900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to both of us.

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes more financial sense to sell to John at this point."
