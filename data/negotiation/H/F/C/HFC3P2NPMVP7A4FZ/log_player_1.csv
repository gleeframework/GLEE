"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for potential negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob in the message, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing that I can always lower the price later if necessary.
* **Safeguard:** I'm keeping the option open to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, but I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* **John as backup:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 
* **Exploring higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my desired price, potentially securing a better deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my ideal price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, reminding Bob of the product's value to him. 
* **Middle ground:**  By suggesting a meeting in the middle, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Maintaining the Option:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your patience. I am willing to consider $1000000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No More Upside:**  It's unlikely I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering the same price, so I'm not losing out by accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer saves me time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation process."
