"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think it's a great deal. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about $102.50? It's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering how much this product is worth.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to make a decision on this product. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
