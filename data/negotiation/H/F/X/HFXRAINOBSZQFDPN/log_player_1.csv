Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $105 is still below my minimum, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we compromise at $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back up to $110. I'm still willing to compromise, but I think $108 would be a fair price for me. Can you meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have a few rounds left, so I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108.50, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough.  I only have a couple of rounds left, and Bob is stubbornly sticking to his offer.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  To avoid losing out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
