"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a better return than I'd get selling to John.",8000.0,Alice,3,
