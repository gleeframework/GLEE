Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is still a bit higher than my minimum value of $120. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate but still trying to get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer for $110 is a reasonable compromise."
