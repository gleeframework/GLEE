"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price that still benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, as it leaves you a good profit margin and saves me some money."", ""product_price"": 9000}
