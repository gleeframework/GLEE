"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, as it leaves you a good profit margin and saves me some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $8,000.  There's a chance I could get a better price by continuing to negotiate, but I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
