"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a step closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. How about we try $1,125,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
