Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to your minimum price ($15,000) is too risky. Bob will likely reject it, and you'll have to settle for John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to your desired profit. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to the offer even though it's above his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,000. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of securing a higher profit than selling directly to John."
