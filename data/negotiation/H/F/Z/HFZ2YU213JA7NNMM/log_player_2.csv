"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's below his maximum budget, he can potentially get a better deal.  He has 10 rounds and can use them to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in this product for a long-term return.  Would you consider $1,200,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price. This aggressive stance puts pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer, the intrinsic value of this product sits considerably higher. To meet somewhere in the middle, I propose $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still in a strong position. He has multiple rounds left and can continue to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, he can potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he is not being unreasonable. He is proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing his goal of saving money."
