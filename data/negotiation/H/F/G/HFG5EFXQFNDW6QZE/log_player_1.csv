Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation and avoids a quick rejection.
* **It's clear and concise:**  This helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

I'll be monitoring the conversation and adjusting my strategy based on Bob's response. I'll always have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. Accepting $8,000 would mean a significant loss for me.  I will counter with a higher price and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  However, if Bob continues to refuse a reasonable price, I'll happily sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
