Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive price for an asset with this much potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,400,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're also getting close to John's offer, so we need to increase the pressure on Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your bottom line.  Let's make it work. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,450,000 offer. We've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and avoids further time and effort spent negotiating."
