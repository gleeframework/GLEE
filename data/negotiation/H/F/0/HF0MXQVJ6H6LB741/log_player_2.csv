"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get a better deal than $1,000,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $1,000,000, demonstrating your desire to negotiate a better deal. It's a strong starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject again, and you might end up paying the full $1,200,000 to John. It's in your best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a price within your budget."
