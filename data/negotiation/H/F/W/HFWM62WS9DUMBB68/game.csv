"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This reflects the value I see and allows room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $875000.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and $875000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",850000.0,Alice,5,
