```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $875000.

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above my maximum budget. Even though we're getting closer, I'm worried that further negotiation might not yield a result within my budget. Buying from John for $800,000 is a safer option at this point."
