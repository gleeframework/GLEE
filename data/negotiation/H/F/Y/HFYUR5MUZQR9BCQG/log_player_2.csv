"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price point.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 14000}
