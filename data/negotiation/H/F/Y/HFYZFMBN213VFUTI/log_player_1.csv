Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy it for $150 provides a safety net.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below the guaranteed price from John ($130 instead of $150) gives Bob a perceived deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
 
This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of him rejecting the offer."
