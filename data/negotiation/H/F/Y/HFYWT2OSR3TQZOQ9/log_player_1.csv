Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You want to get as much as possible, but you're still open to negotiation.
* **Leaves room for bargaining:**  $14,000 gives Bob some room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Shows you're confident in the product's value:**  This price signals that you believe the product is worth a lot, encouraging Bob to take you seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is your minimum, you can likely get more from Bob.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation going and may be able to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make sure I get the value I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$12,500 is a good deal! It's higher than your minimum acceptable price and shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and gets you closer to your initial asking price."
