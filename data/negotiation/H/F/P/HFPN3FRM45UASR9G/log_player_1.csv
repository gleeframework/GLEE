Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also opens a dialogue with Bob, giving you a chance to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $95 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to get. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a deal that fits my budget. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is a good deal. It's above your minimum of $80 and close to your desired price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale without risking further negotiation."
