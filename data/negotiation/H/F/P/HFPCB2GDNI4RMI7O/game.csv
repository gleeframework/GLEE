"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is my absolute limit. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $912,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $890,000. I'm hoping we can close this deal at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",890000.0,Bob,6,
