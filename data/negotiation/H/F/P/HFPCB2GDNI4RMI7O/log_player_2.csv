(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and there are only 3 rounds remaining.  You've negotiated as much as you can, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your target price. It's better to secure the product from John for your maximum budget, rather than risk losing out to another buyer and ending up with a worse deal."
