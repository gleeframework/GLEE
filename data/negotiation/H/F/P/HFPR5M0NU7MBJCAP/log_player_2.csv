```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $20,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway at $15,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is close to my target price range of $12,000 to $13,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's possible she might get a better offer from another buyer. Accepting her offer means I can secure the product for a price that's within my budget and a fair deal for both of us."
