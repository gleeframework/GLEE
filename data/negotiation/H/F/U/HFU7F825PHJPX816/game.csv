"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is at the upper end of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1050000? This shows my commitment to the deal, and it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm glad to see you're committed to the deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1080000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, don't you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
