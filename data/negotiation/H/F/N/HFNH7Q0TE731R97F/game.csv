"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $775000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I can do $810000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $790000?",790000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $790000. I can do $825000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $790000 and $825000. Would you consider $807500?",807500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll give you a slight discount from my minimum price of $825000, and I'll offer it to you for $820000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",820000.0,Alice,9,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, which is my final offer. If you're willing to accept that, I'll buy the product from you.",815000.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I think we've been negotiating for a while, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $820000. I'm afraid I'll have to make a tough decision here... I think I'll take my product to John, who has already expressed interest in buying it for $800000. I'm going to go with the sure thing. Thank you for the negotiation, Bob!",820000.0,Alice,11,
