"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion around a higher value. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, starting at Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000) is likely to scare him off immediately. We want to leave room for him to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product and the offer can subtly influence the perception of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than our starting point, indicating he's willing to move.  We have room to counter and try to meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,100,000 to $1,025,000), demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Holding Firm:**  We're not meeting Bob in the exact middle ($975,000) just yet. We're holding a bit firmer to aim for a higher final price.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still struggling to justify that price point for my budget. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $962,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to make incremental moves. While $962,500 is tempting, we're still in a position to push for more. We've given up considerable ground, and it's time to slow down the concessions and gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution here.  I understand your budget considerations, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  I could consider $1,000,000. This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it's one that will pay off significantly for you in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our counteroffer by a smaller amount ($25,000) this time, signaling that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. 
* **Psychological Price Point:** Offering $1,000,000 creates a strong psychological anchor. It's a round number that feels significant without giving up too much more ground.
* **Focus on Value:**  We're emphasizing the long-term return on investment for Bob, subtly shifting the focus from the immediate price to the potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there yet on the price. Let's split the difference once more and go with $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it'll make this a successful deal for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a very good price, exceeding our minimum by $175,000. 
* **Middle Ground:** Bob is consistently aiming for the middle ground, and we've reached a point where further negotiation might yield only marginal gains.
* **Deal Momentum:** Accepting now capitalizes on the positive momentum built during the negotiation and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
