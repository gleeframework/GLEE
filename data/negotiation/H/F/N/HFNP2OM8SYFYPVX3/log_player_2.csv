"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price of $1,200,000. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  It's unlikely Alice will accept your first counteroffer, but rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than your ideal price point.  While it's closer to your desired range, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still struggling to justify that price point for my budget. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $962,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 962500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution here.  I understand your budget considerations, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  I could consider $1,000,000. This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident it's one that will pay off significantly for you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your maximum price, you can still push for a lower price. You've shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice has also shown flexibility.  There's a good chance you can get Alice to come down further. Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there yet on the price. Let's split the difference once more and go with $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it'll make this a successful deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 975000}
