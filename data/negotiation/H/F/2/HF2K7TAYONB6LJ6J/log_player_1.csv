"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and leaves a good deal of profit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000, and it's a fair compromise after he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $8,500 is still a good deal for me. This is higher than what I could get from John, and I'm only a few rounds into the negotiation.  It's better to secure a decent profit now than risk losing out on a better deal later."
