"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still within Bob's budget but not the best possible price.

It's better to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to get a better deal.  Buying from John immediately would not be the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is still too high.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for this product. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at 87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $87.5, which is still higher than Bob's desired price but closer to his maximum value.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

It's still worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations. Bob has 7 rounds remaining, and there's a possibility that Alice might be willing to lower the price further. Buying from John at this point would be premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $86.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $87.5, which is closer to Bob's desired price but still higher than his maximum value.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

Bob's goal is to get the price as low as possible.  By offering $86, Bob is signaling his willingness to negotiate while still pushing to get closer to his ideal price. This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at 88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $88, which is still higher than Bob's desired price but closer to his maximum value.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

Even though Alice has come down a bit,  it's still worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations. There are 5 rounds remaining. Bob still has room to bargain and push for a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would be premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $88, which is still above Bob's desired price.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer.  Since there are only a few rounds remaining, Bob is increasing the pressure on Alice to reach a deal. By offering $87,  Bob shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to meet you at 88.25. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $88.25, which is close to Bob's desired price, but still higher than what he's willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

It's still worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations. There are 3 rounds remaining, and Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice might be pressured to lower the price further.  Buying from John at this point would be premature.  With only a few rounds left,  Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $88.25, which is close to Bob's desired price, but still higher than what he's willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option.

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a concession if she really wants to make the sale. Bob has indicated a willingness to compromise while still striving for a good price. Since there are only two rounds left, the pressure is on Alice to make a deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to 87.50. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to think about it for a moment. Can I get back to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $87.5, which is the price Bob was willing to pay in the previous round. This is a good deal for Bob, as it is well below John's price of $100. 
* **John's offer:** $100, which is still a fallback option, but Alice is now offering a better price.

Alice has accepted Bob's counteroffer, which is a good outcome for Bob. This is a good time to accept the offer as there is only one round left, and further negotiation may not be possible."
