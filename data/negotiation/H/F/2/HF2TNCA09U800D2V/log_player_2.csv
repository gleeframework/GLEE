Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees the best price for me."
