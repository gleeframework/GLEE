The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000. This means you are better off negotiating with Alice or buying from John. Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best choice at this point."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice."

I'm offering $1,700,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now offering $1,750,000, which is still more than your budget, but you've already made multiple counteroffers. This indicates Alice might be willing to negotiate, but you don't have the time or energy to continue negotiating with her. Since John is offering the product for $1,500,000, it's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
