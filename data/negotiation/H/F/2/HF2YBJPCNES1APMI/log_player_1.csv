{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Enthusiastic Message:** I'm trying to create a positive and engaging tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to negotiate if needed, but I'm starting strong. 

**Remember:** This is just the first step in the negotiation.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Negotiation:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's genuinely interested in a higher price or if $90 is his absolute limit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'll aim for a compromise around $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Focus on Agreement:** My message is encouraging Bob to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to:

* **Test Bob's commitment:** If he accepts, I get a good price.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but not desperate to settle for his initial offer.
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, possibly going down to $92.50, but I'll be careful not to drop below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $90, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $90, showing that he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate.  It's important to recognize when a reasonable compromise is within reach.
* **Profit Margin:** While $90 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a profit over selling to John.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point. It allows me to sell the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a situation where I'm forced to sell to John for a lower amount."
