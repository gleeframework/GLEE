"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
My goal is to maximize my profit, and while $13,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I will try to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,200 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's final offer of $13,200 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
