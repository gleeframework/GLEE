"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
