"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  Let's try this: $890,000. That's a significant compromise on my part and a very good price for this product.",890000.0,Alice,5,
