"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While $875,000 is a decent offer, I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, closer to my target."
