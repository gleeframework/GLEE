"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $17000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $12000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is a significant price reduction from my previous offer.  Let's make a deal!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Bob,6,
