{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to make a counteroffer. 

Remember, I'm aiming for the best possible price, but also don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and I'm willing to risk a little more negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $17,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

This counteroffer attempts to meet Bob halfway. It's lower than my initial price but still above my minimum. The message also emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, it's not enough to justify selling the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a significant price reduction from my previous offer.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. It's only $500 above my minimum acceptable price, and it's a substantial compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping the message will persuade Bob that this is a fair deal. If he still rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting clear that we're too far apart on price.  Rather than continue negotiating and risking further price concessions, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum and a guaranteed sale."
