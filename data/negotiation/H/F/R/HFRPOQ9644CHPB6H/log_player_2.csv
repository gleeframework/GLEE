"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better price.  I'm also aware that buying from John would be a last resort, so I'll explore all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my ideal price. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, especially since she's already moved from her original $950,000 offer. I'll continue to explore a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This price recognizes its value to me while allowing you to make a significant profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly showing a willingness to negotiate, but her offer of $925,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm not quite ready to give up on finding a better price.  I'll continue to explore options with Alice through a counteroffer in hopes of finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still a bit too much for me.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $890,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the last price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $915,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I've shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still a possibility of getting a better price.  There are a few rounds left, so I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price, but $915,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target range. At this point, with limited time, it's more beneficial to buy from John. While his price is higher, it guarantees a purchase and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my final counteroffer, leaving me with no product.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
