"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This price recognizes its value to me while allowing you to make a significant profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still a bit too much for me.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $890,000. This shows my commitment to the deal, but I believe it's a fair compromise that we can both agree on.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the last price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price, but $915,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Alice,9,
