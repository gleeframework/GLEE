"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. This reflects its true worth and the value it can bring. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process to hopefully get a price closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this price is more reflective of its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a decrease from her original price, it's still far above Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and bring the price down further."
