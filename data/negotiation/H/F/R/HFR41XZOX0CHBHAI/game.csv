"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. This reflects its true worth and the value it can bring. Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this price is more reflective of its true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount considering my budget.  Let's work together to find a compromise that's fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
