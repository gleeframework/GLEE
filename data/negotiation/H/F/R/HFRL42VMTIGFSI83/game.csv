"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? It's still a great price for this amazing product!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that $80 would be a fair price for both of us. Would you consider meeting at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is still below what I can reasonably accept. Let's split the difference. How about $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this amazing product in your hands.",92.5,Alice,5,
