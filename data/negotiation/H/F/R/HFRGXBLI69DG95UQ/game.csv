"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
