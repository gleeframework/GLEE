Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also polite and friendly, which can help build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $60 is simply unacceptable. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
