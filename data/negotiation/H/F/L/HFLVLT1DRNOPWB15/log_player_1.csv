Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($1,500,000 - $800,000 = $700,000) while leaving Bob with a potential profit incentive of $200,000.

This strategy balances your desire for maximum profit with the need to make the offer attractive to Bob."
