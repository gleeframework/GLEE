"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
