Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000 (John's offer)
* **Potential for higher profit:** I want to maximize my earnings, so I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Uncertainty about Bob's valuation:**  Since I don't know Bob's willingness to pay, I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 

This strategy gives me a chance to get a better price than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
