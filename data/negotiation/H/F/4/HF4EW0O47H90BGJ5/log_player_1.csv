"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This is to see if he's willing to pay a premium and to gauge his level of interest. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer to see if Bob is willing to budge. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's last offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's only $500 more than his last offer. If he rejects, I'll be forced to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that we are getting too close to the end of the negotiation rounds. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and ensures that I don't lose out on a potentially better deal."
