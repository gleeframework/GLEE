Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring the deal is appealing.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's value leaves room for potential negotiation if he wants to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, so I won't go lower than that. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
