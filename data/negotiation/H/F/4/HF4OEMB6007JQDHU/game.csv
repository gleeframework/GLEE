"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1500000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. It's a significant difference from my previous offer. However, I'm willing to compromise. My final offer is $1550000. This is the best I can do. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm afraid $1550000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1350000. This is my absolute maximum. I hope we can come to an agreement.,1350000.0,Bob,6,
