"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it is worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $18,000. This offer is valid for 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject the offer. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $18,000, which is $3,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for the same price it's worth to me, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
