Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we say $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go below John's $100 offer.  It's better to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the price we know works."
