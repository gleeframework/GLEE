"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and this offer is a steal compared to its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  It's likely that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will counter with a price closer to her $12,000 valuation.
* **Avoiding John's price:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the most logical decision, balancing potential savings with the risk of further negotiation."
