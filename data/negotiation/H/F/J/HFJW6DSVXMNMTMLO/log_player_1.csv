Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since you know the product is worth $150 to Bob, starting at $130 gives him a potential $20 gain, making it more tempting for him to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer provides space for a counter-offer from Bob while still ensuring a significant profit margin for you if he accepts immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is your absolute minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and avoid the risk of losing the sale, there's still room for negotiation.  You know the product is worth significantly more to him.  It's worth risking another round to see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy is often perceived as fair and can make it more likely for Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining a Profit:** $120 is still a significant profit margin for you ($20 above your minimum). 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By not dropping to $110 immediately, you're testing how serious Bob is about staying closer to $100. His response will give you valuable information for the next step in the negotiation."
