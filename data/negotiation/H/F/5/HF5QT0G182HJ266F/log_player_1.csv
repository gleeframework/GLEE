"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can still do better with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $8,250 is tempting, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to try to meet him halfway again with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can't go lower than $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $8,625, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,625 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  With only four rounds left, I'm confident I won't get a better deal."
