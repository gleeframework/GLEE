Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, giving me a strong fallback position.

By offering the product at $149, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value."
