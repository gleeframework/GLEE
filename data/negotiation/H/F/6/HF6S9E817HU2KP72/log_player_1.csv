Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Confident tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **John as a backup:**  While I aim high with Bob, having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum."
