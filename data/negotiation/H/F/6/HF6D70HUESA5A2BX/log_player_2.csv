"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,000 is less than $12,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,000.  This means you're saving $1,000."
