Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still gives me a profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob and suggesting a mutually beneficial agreement. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with my first offer, leaving room for potential counteroffers and further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept a counteroffer, make a new offer, or walk away and sell to John."
