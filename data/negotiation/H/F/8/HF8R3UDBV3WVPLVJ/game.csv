"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about we aim for $900,000? I think this would be fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $925,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still lower than your initial proposal. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
