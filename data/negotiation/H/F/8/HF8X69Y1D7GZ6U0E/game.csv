"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $1200000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I can do $1400000 if you're willing to meet me in the middle again. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1520000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1400000 is a tough pill to swallow, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession.

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1480000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
