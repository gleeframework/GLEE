I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good deal quickly.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. I'm happy to accept his offer and secure a profit."
