Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to part with the product for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob sees the product as worth $1,500,000.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed backup offer from John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's valuation while ensuring you don't scare him away. A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him balk, even if it's a good deal for him.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  I've done my research and understand its value in the market. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions you as knowledgeable about the product's worth.
* **Strong Opening:** $1,350,000 is a significant portion of the potential profit margin ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000), aiming for a 70/30 split in your favor.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" (even if not explicitly John) creates a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a two-way street. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still exceeding your $1,200,000 minimum."
