Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming high initially allows us to potentially capture a larger portion of that value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate downwards, potentially settling on a price still significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob's business, justifying the high price. This approach focuses on the benefits rather than just the cost. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  How we proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. We might need to adjust our price slightly if he rejects the initial offer, but always aiming to stay above our guaranteed $800,000 from John."
