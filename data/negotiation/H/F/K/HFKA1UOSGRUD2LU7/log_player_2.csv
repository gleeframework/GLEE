While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll counter again and see if we can close the gap."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to $840,000.  While I'd love to get it even lower, I've already rejected a couple of offers and the risk of her walking away or me running out of rounds is increasing. It's time to accept this offer and secure the product."
