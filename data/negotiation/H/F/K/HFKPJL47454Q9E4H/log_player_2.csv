# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $16,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  It's best to reject and counter-offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer is still too high for you. You can still get the product for less from John. Reject and try to counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and closer to a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a tough pill for me to swallow.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750? This allows us both to feel like we got a somewhat fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,750 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still over your budget. You can get the same product for $8,000 from John, making it the most financially sound choice."
