"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $16,000 feels fair. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $16,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and closer to a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a tough pill for me to swallow.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750? This allows us both to feel like we got a somewhat fair deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
