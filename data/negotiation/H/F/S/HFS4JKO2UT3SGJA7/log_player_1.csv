Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has room to go higher if he wants to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still lower than my initial offer.  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm raising the price slightly to $925,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too easily. I believe this price still offers value to Bob while getting me closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm sticking with a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that balances both our needs. Bob is getting a good deal, and I'm still above my minimum. I think this price point has a good chance of getting accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly lower, and I don't think there's much room for negotiation at this point.  While it's frustrating to leave some money on the table, selling to John for $800,000 ensures I don't get into a bidding war that might end up with me accepting an even lower price."
