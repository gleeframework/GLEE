"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, we are offering it at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product worth $1,000,000 at a competitive rate. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! You're getting the product for $50,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly less than its value to Alice. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and waiting carries the risk of losing the deal altogether."
