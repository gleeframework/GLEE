Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I think I can get at least $135 from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $135? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $132.50 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $120.  I'm happy to close the deal."
