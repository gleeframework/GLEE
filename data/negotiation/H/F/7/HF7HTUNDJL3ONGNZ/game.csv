"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  My asking price is $14000.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13500? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $13000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's try $13750. This feels like a fair price that would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not able to go higher than $13250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close the deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're running out of time, and I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  $13250 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $14000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we settle on $13750? This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs and lets us finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",13750.0,Alice,7,
