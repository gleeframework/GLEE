Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is fair to both parties. It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to accept, or counteroffer, allowing us to reach a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$90 is closer to my minimum, but I can still try to get a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
