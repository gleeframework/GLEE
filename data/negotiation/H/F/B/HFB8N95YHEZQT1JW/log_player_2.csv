"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $7,500? I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $1,500 reduction from Alice's initial offer shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter, so it's not a final ""take it or leave it"" offer.
* **Highlights value to Bob:** Mentioning fairness subtly implies Bob sees the product as valuable, but is simply working with a budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:**  While $8,250 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Alice is willing to compromise:** Alice already lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Building momentum:** Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and signals Bob's seriousness about getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $8,000 is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant reduction:**  A $250 reduction from Alice's offer shows Bob is still serious about getting a better deal, without being overly aggressive.
* **Maintains a positive tone:**  Focuses on ""fairness"" and finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""agreement"" implies that this could be the last counteroffer, encouraging Alice to take the deal."
