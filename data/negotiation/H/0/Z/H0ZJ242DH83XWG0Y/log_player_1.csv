"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's 20% above Bob's perceived value, which gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him strengthens my position. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  We're still early in the negotiation (round 2). I have time to push for a better price.
* **John's offer:** While $1,000,000 from John is tempting, I still believe I can get a higher price from Bob if I continue negotiating.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll aim for a price that is somewhat higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Focus on the value:** I will again emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him why it's worth more than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Remember, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you!  Let's find a compromise. How about $950,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value we've both agreed upon."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm proposing $950,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.  
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that $950,000 is a fair reflection of that value. 
* **Compromise language:** I'm using language like ""compromise"" and ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see this as a reasonable offer.

**Strategy:**

* This is a calculated middle ground. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll still have options to negotiate further.
* I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I still believe I can get a better deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $900,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is tempting, it's not significantly higher than Bob's current offer, and I don't want to lose a potential buyer.

**Moving Forward:**

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a good deal and ensuring that the sale goes through.  I've successfully navigated the negotiation, and I'm happy with the outcome."
