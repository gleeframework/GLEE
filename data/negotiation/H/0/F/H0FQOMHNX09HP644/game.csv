"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $11000 right now.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500.  Let's try $12500. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us and it's the highest I can go right now.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $13750? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13750 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $12250, which is a fair compromise and very close to my limit. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your time.",12250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,7,
