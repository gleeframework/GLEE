{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn more.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is simply too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm countering with a price of $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable value but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us to try and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I really think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is still below my minimum desired price, it's getting closer to my acceptable range.  I'm also starting to realize that Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
