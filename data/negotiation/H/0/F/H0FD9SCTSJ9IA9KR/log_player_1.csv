Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation"", I signal that I'm willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Reasoning:**  This strategy aims to find out what Bob is willing to pay while also leaving some wiggle room for myself. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $100.  
* **Negotiate Further:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price. This can increase his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $92? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.  $92 is a midpoint between my initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:**  By making a counter-offer, I'm hoping to reach a deal that is agreeable to both of us. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price."
