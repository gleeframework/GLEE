"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $8,250 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $9,000.
* This price is within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $3,750 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob might try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially going back to her initial offer is too high.  It's more strategic to accept this offer and secure a good price."
