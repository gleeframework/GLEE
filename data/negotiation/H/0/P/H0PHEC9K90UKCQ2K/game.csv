"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm not in a rush to sell, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer for now.",875000.0,Alice,3,
