Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Bob's offer:

To be honest, $7,000 is still quite low, and I'm getting close to what John is offering.  I'd be willing to make a significant move down to $14,000, but that's my absolute best. If this doesn't work, I think it's best we part ways. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand where you're coming from. However, to be completely honest,  $14,000 is just too far out of my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,500, but that's really the absolute maximum I can afford.  If that doesn't work, then I appreciate your time and I might have to consider other options.

Bob is not budging significantly, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
