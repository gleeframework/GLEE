"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is quite steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could stretch to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a good deal.  To be honest, $7,000 is still quite low, and I'm getting close to what John is offering.  I'd be willing to make a significant move down to $14,000, but that's my absolute best. If this doesn't work, I think it's best we part ways. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand where you're coming from. However, to be completely honest,  $14,000 is just too far out of my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,500, but that's really the absolute maximum I can afford.  If that doesn't work, then I appreciate your time and I might have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
