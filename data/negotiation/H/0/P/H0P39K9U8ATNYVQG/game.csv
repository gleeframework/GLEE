"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see its value, I can't go that high. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $950,000 is still quite low for what I can get elsewhere.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
