"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has a clear limit of $800,000 and Alice is offering significantly more.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my maximum.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit of $800,000.  Even though she has lowered the price, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile for Bob.  It's time to move on and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $800,000."
