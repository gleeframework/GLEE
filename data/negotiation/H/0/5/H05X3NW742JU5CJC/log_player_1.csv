"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1,000,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While we want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We are better off countering and seeing if we can move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession and reflects my eagerness to find a solution."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** We want to maintain a firm position and make it clear that Bob's initial offer was far too low. 
* **Justification:**  We provide a reason for our counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value and our willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Movement:** We lower our price by $300,000, which is a substantial concession but still keeps us well above Bob's offer and our minimum. This shows we're willing to negotiate but expect movement on his end as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting this offer ensures we get our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
