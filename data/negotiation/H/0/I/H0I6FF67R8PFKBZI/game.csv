"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However,  $600,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which reflects the significant potential benefits I see in this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, allowing you to get a solid return while still giving me a competitive price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product for $700,000. Considering its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This price takes into account the potential benefits you mentioned, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $725,000. It shows we're both serious about making this deal happen. However, I'm still a little above my target price point. I'm willing to offer $710,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product for $710,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $720,000. This price is still a compromise, but I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",720000.0,Alice,5,
