I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $8,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
