Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than $1,050,000.
