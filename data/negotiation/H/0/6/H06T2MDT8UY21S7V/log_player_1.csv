"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  However, I'm keeping my eye on John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm also concerned about losing the potential for a higher offer from John if I settle now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to find common ground.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer of $1,020,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  If we can't agree on this price, then I'm going to have to move on.  It's up to you now."", ""product_price"": 1020000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,020,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little below my ideal price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,015,000 is a good price, especially considering Bob's willingness to walk away.  I'm also wary of the fact that John's offer is only $1,000,000."
