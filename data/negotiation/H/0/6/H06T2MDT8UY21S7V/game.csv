"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to find common ground.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer of $1,020,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  If we can't agree on this price, then I'm going to have to move on.  It's up to you now.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,020,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",1015000.0,Bob,8,
