Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to sell to Bob first offers a chance to earn an even higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had that information, you could tailor your offer more precisely."
