,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're thinking.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $20000. I'd be willing to go up to $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $15000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a stalemate, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16500 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,10,
