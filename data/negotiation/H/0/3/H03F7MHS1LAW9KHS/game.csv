"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm keen to make this deal work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $990,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",990000.0,Bob,6,
