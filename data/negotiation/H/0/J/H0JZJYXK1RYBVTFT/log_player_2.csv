"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not even close to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value in this product, $22,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant reduction from Alice's asking price, showing that I'm serious about purchasing but also emphasizing my budget constraints.  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $19,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, $19,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the discussion and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $19,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This shows consistency and firmness in my negotiation stance.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and the fact that Alice has already lowered her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product. It's truly worth it. How about we settle at $17,000? That's a significant compromise from my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $17,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation, as I believe I can potentially get the price down further, or at least make Alice consider my offer more seriously. It's also important to remember that I have the option to buy from John for $10,000 at any point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a good compromise. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $14,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still staying within my budget and making it clear that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm trying to find a middle ground and emphasize the need for a mutually beneficial agreement."
