Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $15,500. This is my final offer, as it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $17,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where Alice is unwilling to come down to his desired price. He has already made a counteroffer that was rejected, and it seems Alice is sticking to her minimum price point.  

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can get the product from John for $15,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from John.  He will be able to save $2,000 compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
