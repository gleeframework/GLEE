{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses my confidence in the product's value to Bob.  I'll see if he's interested, and if not, we can negotiate further or I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
I'm offering $120, which is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will get us to an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $118? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $2 less than my last counteroffer and still above my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher."
