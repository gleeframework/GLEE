Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While the offer is high, it's not outrageously above John's offer, showing Bob we are serious but also open to negotiation."
