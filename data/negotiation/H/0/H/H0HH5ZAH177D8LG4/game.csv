"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $2,000,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe $1,550,000 is a fair price that reflects its value and allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $1,600,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
