Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, it's too far below my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still provides me with a reasonable profit while allowing you to get a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, $1,200,000 is a good offer, especially considering the risk of Bob walking away completely.  It's a good balance between what I want and a reasonable price for him."
