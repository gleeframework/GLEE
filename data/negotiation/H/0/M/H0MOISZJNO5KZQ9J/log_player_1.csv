Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aim high initially to maximize potential profit.  The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and still allows you to potentially secure a price well above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **John as Backup:**  You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about obtaining a price closer to the product's true worth to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my price to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:**  You are moving closer to Bob's offer, indicating willingness to negotiate, but you are still significantly above his initial offer and closer to the product's actual value to him.
* **Justification:**  By framing the price reduction as a ""compromise"" and highlighting the product's value, you maintain a strong negotiating position.
* **Maintain Walk-Away Option:**  Remember, you still have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $950,000 as a compromise. I'm willing to pay this price to get the product, but I'm not willing to go higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding your minimum acceptable price by $150,000.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $950,000 is his maximum price. Pushing further risks losing the sale. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now secures a significant sum and avoids potential delays or the risk of Bob changing his mind."
