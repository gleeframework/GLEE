"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, $18000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer with $15000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of purchasing the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,5,
