"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to Bob ($125 vs. $120).  While she claims it's a good deal, it's actually more expensive than buying from John. Bob should reject the offer and buy from John for a lower price."
