Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob if he's interested but finds the initial price a bit steep. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the price by mentioning ""significant value"" without overselling the product.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $15,000 (John's offer), so you have some wiggle room."
