"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $120 by negotiating with Alice, or you can buy it from John for $150.  It's in your best interest to try to get a lower price."

It's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a lower price than $130.  The worst-case scenario is you end up paying $150 to John, but there's still potential for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is holding firm at $125, and you've already offered $110.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get you below $125, which is still a significant amount of money compared to what the product is worth to you.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $150."
