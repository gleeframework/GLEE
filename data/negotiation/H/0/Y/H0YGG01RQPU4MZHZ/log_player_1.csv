Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,000,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $925,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This could still result in a significantly higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Confidence and Justification:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value and provides a brief justification for the price, making it more likely for Bob to consider it seriously."
