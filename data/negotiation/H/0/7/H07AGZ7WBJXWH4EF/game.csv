"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for this product. This price includes not only the cost of the product itself but also a comprehensive service package designed to ensure its optimal performance. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer that respects both the value of the product and your budget.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

In light of our previous discussion, I am proposing a revised price of $9,000 for the product.

I hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
