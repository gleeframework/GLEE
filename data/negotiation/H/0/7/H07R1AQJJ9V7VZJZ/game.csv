"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
