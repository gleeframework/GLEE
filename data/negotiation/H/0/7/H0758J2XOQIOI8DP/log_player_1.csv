Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $135 is higher than Bob's $120 valuation, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $135 is still above your minimum of $150, so you're not losing money. 
* **It opens the negotiation:**  The message leaves space for Bob to discuss the price further. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room for negotiation, and by having a clear minimum in mind, you ensure you don't undervalue your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. I understand your offer, but I need to stay above $130 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go to $130, but I'm willing to meet you at $128. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $128 is closer to my desired price than before, it's still below my minimum of $150.  I'm not willing to keep negotiating, and John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150.  It's more efficient and profitable to sell to John now."
