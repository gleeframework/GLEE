"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $12750. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12900 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I'll counter with $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,8,
