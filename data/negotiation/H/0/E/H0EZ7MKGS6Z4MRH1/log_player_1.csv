Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the general market. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the potential benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the potential for a higher profit margin.
* **Strong Opening:**  By presenting a confident price that reflects your understanding of the product's value, you set a strong tone for the negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are comfortable with potential counter-offers from Bob."
