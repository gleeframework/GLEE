"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
