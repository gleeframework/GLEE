"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product brings. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $920,000 is still not quite enough for me to let go of this product. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's compromise at $940,000. This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $940,000. Can we do $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,6,
