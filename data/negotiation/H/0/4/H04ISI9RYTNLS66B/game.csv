"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get close to your initial price, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $2,000,000, so I'm proposing $1,900,000. Would you consider this a reasonable compromise?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
