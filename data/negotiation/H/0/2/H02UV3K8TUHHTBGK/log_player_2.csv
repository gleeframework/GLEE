"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This price is closer to your offer and still represents a good value for you considering the product's benefits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice to get a better price."
