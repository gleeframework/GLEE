Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product valued at $1,000,000. I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high price like $1,800,000 sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started lower. 
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims high, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price outweighs the risk of losing Bob as a buyer in this scenario."
