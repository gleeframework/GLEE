Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value this product can bring to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, considering the value this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay. It's better to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiations."
