I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value this product can bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still out of my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get a good return on this product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, considering the value this product can bring to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
