"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 simply doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. That's the best I can do.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal.  How about we compromise at $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still lower than what I could get elsewhere. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $94, but that's my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.",94.0,Alice,7,
