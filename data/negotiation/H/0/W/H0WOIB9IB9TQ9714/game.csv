"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8000?  That's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $8000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $7200. Can you consider that?",7200.0,Bob,6,
