"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business.

While Alice's offer of $725,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can potentially push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further bargaining."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this discussion. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I believe we can find a common ground. My counteroffer is $715,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit margin for me. I look forward to your response and hope we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $715,000 is very close to Bob's desired price point.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation and rejection becomes significant. 
* **Better than John:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $85,000 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to push for a lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal or having to pay the full price to John."
