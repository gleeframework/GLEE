Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly more than Bob's perceived value but less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on a ""deal"":**  Framing the offer as a good deal for both of us can encourage Bob to see the value in negotiating.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for counteroffers and further negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a higher price without risking a quick rejection. 

**Important Note:**  This is a strategic starting point. I will adapt my approach based on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and is also much lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. Accepting this would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Although Bob is at his limit, I can still try to push for a higher price. I know he values the product at $800,000, so there's room for a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup gives me leverage. Knowing I can sell to him for $1,500,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind that I need to be realistic but also firm. I will also analyze Bob's response to gauge his sincerity and willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $1,000,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still much higher than Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have clear boundaries.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $1,000,000, it's still a good deal for him.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  By stating ""let's try to find common ground,"" I  encourage a collaborative approach and show a willingness to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I might need to consider adjusting my strategy.  If he counteroffers again, I will assess if his offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and adjust my next counteroffer accordingly.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind to ensure I don't lose out on a significantly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **John's offer is much higher:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which makes accepting Bob's offer a poor decision financially.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is closer to my price range, there's still room for negotiation. He's shown a willingness to compromise, indicating there's a possibility of finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while acknowledging his willingness to compromise. I will also emphasize the value of the product to him and continue to explore ways to find a solution that works for both of us. It's important to remember that John's offer remains a powerful bargaining chip, allowing me to stand my ground and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would give you a great product at a fair price, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's finalize this and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $950,000 shows a genuine willingness to find a middle ground. It demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable range.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the benefits for Bob, highlighting the ""great product at a fair price"" and emphasizing the finality of the deal with ""let's finalize this and make this deal happen.""
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning ""moving forward with the sale,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I might need to consider making one final counteroffer closer to his last offer. 
* **John's offer is still on the table:**  I will not hesitate to walk away from the deal if Bob's final counteroffer is too low. I have a guaranteed sale to John at a much higher price, which provides strong leverage in these final stages."
