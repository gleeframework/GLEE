"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's a better price than the initial offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and attempt to get closer to his desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would give you a great product at a fair price, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's finalize this and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  Bob has a sure deal with John for $800,000.  It's the most financially responsible choice to accept John's offer and avoid further risk of going over budget."
