Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, and I'm sure it'll be even more valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing the value to Bob helps justify the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer is not my final position. I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While lower than my initial price, it's still a good deal for me. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and increase the chance of securing a higher price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, making the counteroffer feel more reasonable.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product, implying that the price is still a fair reflection of its worth.
* **Mid-Point:**  $12,500 represents a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $12,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with the option to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time Factor:**  The negotiation process is already taking time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision in this situation."
