"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate and creates the perception of a better deal later. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The high initial offer allows for me to come down in price during counteroffers, which might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more inclined to accept.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. If Bob doesn't offer a price close to my minimum after a few rounds, I'll walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low and nowhere near my minimum price.  I need to steer the negotiation closer to my range. Selling to John is an option but I can likely get a better price from Bob with a counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to pay $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  I lowered my price by $40 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above my minimum of $120, leaving me room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Compromise:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm hoping Bob feels like he's getting a better deal and is encouraged to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $70? That's a pretty significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $70 is still significantly below my $120 minimum.  It's time to push a bit harder towards my target price, or consider taking John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're trying to reach a fair price, $70 is too far off from what I can accept.  This product is valued much higher, and I need to get at least $110 for it. That's a significant price drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my minimum price more firmly now to signal to Bob that I'm serious.
* **Justification:**  I'm giving a reason for my price (the product's value) without revealing my actual minimum.
* **Final Offer Tone:** While not explicitly my final offer, the tone suggests I'm getting close to my limit.  This might push Bob to make a serious offer or I may walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget, and $110 just doesn't fit into it. My final offer is $75. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with a different seller. I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has signaled that $75 is his absolute limit and he's ready to walk away. 
* **Unlikely to Budge:** Even with further negotiation, it's highly unlikely Bob will come close to my $120 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John. Continuing with Bob at this point has a low chance of success and risks losing both buyers."
