**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $740000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway again, and her offer is now only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  While I would still prefer to pay less, it's getting close to my budget. Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and ensuring I get the product.  It's also significantly cheaper than buying from John."
