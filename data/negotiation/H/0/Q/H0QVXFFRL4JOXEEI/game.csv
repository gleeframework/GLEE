"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget limitations.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move this forward, would you consider $1,500,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on this. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm very serious about acquiring this product, but my absolute maximum is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge this gap.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
