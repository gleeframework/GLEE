"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a decent amount, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have several rounds left, and you can potentially secure a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and explore higher offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $110. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to your desired price, you're still within the first half of your negotiation rounds. You have time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  It's always a good strategy to try and maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet at $108? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price at $108. I'm willing to pay $102 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $102 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $80, you still have several rounds left and the potential to get a better price.  It's better to try and maximize your profit rather than settle for a price that's less than you'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However,  $102 isn't quite what I had in mind. I'm willing to go down to $105, but I really need to get at least that much for this product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $105 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer of $98 is only slightly above your minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's still not very profitable for you.  With only two rounds left, you're unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's a better option to sell to John for $80, as you're guaranteed that price and will avoid further negotiation."
