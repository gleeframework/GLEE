Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'll meet you at $82.5, and that's my final offer 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $82.5. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Buying from John for $80 guarantees you stay within your budget and get the product."
