"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's worth negotiating with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to lower her price. Even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable first step. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.  This leaves room for potential compromise while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $75, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer saves you $5 compared to buying from John. There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal to John and paying $80 isn't worth it at this point."
