{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're willing to go lower than your minimum to secure a deal, but only if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable.
* **It's a friendly message:**  Starting with a positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in that!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but given my budget, I'm unable to go beyond $8,000. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

```

Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer. I've already lowered my price once, and it's clear that he's not willing to go higher.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum,  I'm not willing to risk a further negotiation that could result in a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000, which guarantees my minimum profit."
