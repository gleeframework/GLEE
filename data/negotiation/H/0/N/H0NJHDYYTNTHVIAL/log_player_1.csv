Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much information about my true minimum. 

I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **No Further Negotiation:** There's no upside to continuing the negotiation. I've already reached my target price.
* **Selling Now:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
