"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm happy to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $11,000? This would still give you a good value considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your asking price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price that's a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally seal the deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
