"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a fantastic deal.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than Alice's value, it's more than your $80 maximum and you know John will sell it for $80. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
