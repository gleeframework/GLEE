"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. I'm asking $1,150,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can explore a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500.  This way, we both get a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1112500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price. I have five rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500, which is a significant drop from my last offer. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I will have to consider other options. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1037500. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,037,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that we're not making progress. I've already reached my final offer, and Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than I'm willing to accept. 

With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on a sale is increasing. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
