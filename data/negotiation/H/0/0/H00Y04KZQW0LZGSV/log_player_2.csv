"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if I can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will help me gauge her willingness to negotiate.  I'm also stating my reason for the counteroffer to show I'm being reasonable and am willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this revised offer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still willing to negotiate, but I can likely get a better price than $1,050,000.  It's worth trying to push the price down further before considering the offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. I'm wondering if we can settle on $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's my maximum budget and close to the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is right at my budget limit. It's a strong move as it demonstrates my firm stance while still being a reasonable offer to Alice, given her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your hesitation, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a concession, but it's still not worth the extra $25,000 for me.  Considering that John is offering the product for my maximum budget, it's more prudent to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation. I'm likely to lose more time and potentially even more money if I continue negotiating with Alice."
