"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, and I think it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600000 for it, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000, which is still a great value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not ready to give up on getting the best value for my product. I'm thinking of a price of $820000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. While $820000 is closer, I'm still stuck at my maximum of $800000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both made concessions.  Let's finalize this deal now.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting the best value for my product just yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $815000. This is a very close price to your original offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
