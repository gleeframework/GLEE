Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** I want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but still leave room for Bob to accept.
* **High starting point:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters.
* **John as leverage (implied):** While not explicitly stated, the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong position.  Bob might be encouraged to act quickly.

**Why this is better than simply asking for $1,500,000:**

* **Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of Bob engaging in negotiation. This could lead to a faster sale, which is also valuable.
* **Relationship building:** Even if Bob counters, this initial offer shows a willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal."
