Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Acceptance:** Offering $120 might make Bob hesitate, thinking he could get it cheaper.  $119 is still a great deal for him and a significant profit for you.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
