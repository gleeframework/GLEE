"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer of $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
