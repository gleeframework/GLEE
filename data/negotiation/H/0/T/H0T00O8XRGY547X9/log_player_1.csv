Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need to make at least $8,000 to make this worthwhile, as I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John.
* **Potential for more:**  I'm aiming for a profit, so I'm offering a price slightly higher than my minimum.
* **Risk and Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but if he accepts, I'll make more than my minimum.

This strategy balances the need to secure a sale with the desire to maximize my profit."
