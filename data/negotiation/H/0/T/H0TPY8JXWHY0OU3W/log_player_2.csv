Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Alice met your limit:** She's come down to $800,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay. 
* **John's offer is the same:** Buying from John would also cost you $800,000.
* **Final offer:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, pushing the negotiation further might make her back out.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will stick to her final offer or even walk away. Accepting now secures the product at your target price."
