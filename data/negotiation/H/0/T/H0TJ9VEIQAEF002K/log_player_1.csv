"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to provide room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to our valuation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential and value"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for our discussion"" signals willingness to negotiate.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option of John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is his maximum, accepting it would mean a significant loss for us ($800,000 vs. our potential $1,500,000 with John).  We have room to negotiate and will try to meet somewhere in the middle. We're still early in the rounds, so no need to settle for an unfavorable price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be fair to the value I place on this product, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,750,000.  I believe this offer reflects a significant adjustment on my end while still recognizing the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** We've made a substantial decrease from $2,200,000 to $1,750,000 to show flexibility and signal our willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify our counteroffer being above Bob's budget.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This price aims to find a middle ground between Bob's initial offer and our desired price. 

We'll see if Bob is willing to move closer to our range or if further adjustments are needed in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise given the value we both place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more seriously, which is a good sign. His offer of $1,100,000 is a substantial increase. However, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

We'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000 or higher. We're willing to negotiate further, but not at the cost of losing a substantial amount compared to our alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to compromise is encouraging.  Let's find a solution that truly reflects the value of this product. I'm proposing $1,450,000.  This offer bridges the gap significantly and represents a strong commitment on my end to finalize this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move Closer:** We've made another significant drop to $1,450,000, moving closer to Bob's offer while staying above the $1,300,000 target. 
* **Emphasis on Value and Commitment:** The message reiterates the product's value and highlights our dedication to reaching an agreement.
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This offer aims to gauge if Bob is willing to move closer to our range or if he's firm on a lower price.

We are getting closer to a potential deal, but we also need to keep John's offer in mind as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This represents a substantial increase from my last offer and is the highest I can go while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating a commitment to the negotiation by steadily increasing his offer. While $1,200,000 is less than our ideal price and John's offer, it's a strong price that we should secure now. Here's why:

* **Bird in Hand:**  We have a solid offer on the table. There's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away entirely if we push further.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we get the money sooner rather than later.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonging the negotiation could lead to frustration on both sides and potentially jeopardize the deal.

While selling to John would yield a higher immediate profit, accepting Bob's offer at $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise that avoids potential risks and secures a significant profit."
