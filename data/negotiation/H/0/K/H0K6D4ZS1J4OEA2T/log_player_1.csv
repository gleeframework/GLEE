Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking $115 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob, which might make him more likely to accept.
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language like ""amazing product"" and ""really love it"" to try to make Bob more interested.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I'll be ready to counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $120 (from selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my budget, I am willing to offer $100 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for less than what I can get from John.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and not driving Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language (""great deal"", ""fair profit"") to try to make Bob feel like it's a good offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be ready to either accept his next counteroffer (if it's closer to my desired price) or sell to John."
