"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $9,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,850? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8850.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $9,175. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9175.0,Alice,7,
