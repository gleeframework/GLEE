"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm open to negotiations, but my starting price is $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and will be willing to pay a price closer to his value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still closer to my minimum value than the price I offered him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  I think this is a good compromise and I'm happy to accept it.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
