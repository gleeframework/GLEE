Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my hand entirely. This approach aims to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer seriously. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so there's an incentive for Bob to act quickly if he wants the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
