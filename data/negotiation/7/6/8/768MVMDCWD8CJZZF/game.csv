"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to accept. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,3,
