"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $10,000? I'm really hoping we can close this deal, so let's find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the price John is offering. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation.  While I'm not happy with $9,500, I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. How about $9,750?  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to come up a bit, I'll have to consider my other options.",9750.0,Alice,7,
