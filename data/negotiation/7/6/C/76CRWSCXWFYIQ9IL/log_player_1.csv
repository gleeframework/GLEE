"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I have 8 rounds left and can try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I still have 6 rounds left.  I'm holding out for a better price, hoping that Bob will budge.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer, to show I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $10,000? I'm really hoping we can close this deal, so let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm hoping that by offering $10,000, a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's, I can entice him to accept. This shows good faith and further demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if this will convince him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the price John is offering. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not there.  I've got four rounds left and John is still a viable option.  I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation.  While I'm not happy with $9,500, I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. How about $9,750?  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to come up a bit, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm pushing for a price that's just a little more than Bob's offer, hoping to close the deal while still being just above my minimum.  I'm making this my final offer to see if he'll budge. If not, I'll have to go with John."
