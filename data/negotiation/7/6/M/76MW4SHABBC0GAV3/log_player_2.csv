"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate downwards towards our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low counteroffer establishes a strong negotiating position. While $500,000 is significantly lower than Alice's ask, it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Justification:**  By stating the offer is ""fair considering its value to me,"" we remind Alice our maximum price is driven by our own valuation, not a desire to lowball her.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and suggests a willingness to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the product is worth $500,000 to you, but I believe its value is much higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above our maximum budget.  We know we have an alternative at $800,000, so we hold a strong position.  We need to signal to Alice that we are willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on a price, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We are increasing our offer, demonstrating good faith and a willingness to compromise. However, we're also setting a firm limit and hinting at our alternative option to create urgency.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $650,000 offer is a significant jump from our previous offer but still well below both Alice's offer and our maximum budget. This gives us some negotiating room while keeping the pressure on Alice.
* **Implied Deadline:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that we have an alternative and might not wait indefinitely for her to come down to our price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $850,000, and explicitly stated this is her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, we're unlikely to get a better deal from her. John offers the product for $800,000, which is a guaranteed saving of $50,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a price we know is good."
