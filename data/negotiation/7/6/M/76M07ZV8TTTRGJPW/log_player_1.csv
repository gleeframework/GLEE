"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name]! I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $200, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and possibly counter-offer, giving us information about his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $170 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:** While $170 is above my minimum of $150, it's still a significant discount from my initial asking price.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and demonstrates my willingness to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $170 is closer to my price, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $185? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 185} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  I'm meeting him halfway by offering $185, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage acceptance. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still asking for more than Bob's last offer, showing I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $185. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $175 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $175 is only $5 away from my previous offer and within a reasonable range of my desired profit.
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting the offer, I can always try to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob in the future if the opportunity arises."
