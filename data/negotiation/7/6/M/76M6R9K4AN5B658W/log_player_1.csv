"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum of $80.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While $102 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $98. While it's tempting to take it, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better price.
