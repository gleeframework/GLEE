"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a solution. While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,650,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. It makes more financial sense to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the lower price."
