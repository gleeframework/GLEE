"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand this product is valuable, $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. Could we try something around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a solution. While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
