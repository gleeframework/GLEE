"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10200 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $12000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
