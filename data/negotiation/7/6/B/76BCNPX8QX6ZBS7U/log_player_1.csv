"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but I believe I can find something similar for a lower price elsewhere. I'm willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $140.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $130 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product to you for $135. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $130 for it. This is my final offer. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is offering a reasonable price of $130, it's still below my minimum of $150. I've already negotiated with Bob several times, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go higher. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which aligns with my minimum acceptable value. I will sell the product to John to avoid risking losing out on a better deal."
