"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $80 because it's my minimum price and the deal is finally closing. It's better than selling to John for the same price and continuing the negotiations could lead to a lower price or a deal not happening at all."
