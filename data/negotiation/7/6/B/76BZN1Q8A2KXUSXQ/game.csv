"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product while being reasonable for both parties.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable price given the value I place on the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being closer to your budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's reach an agreement, and I'm sure we'll both be happy with the outcome.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1,525,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,525,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can both walk away satisfied. ",1475000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum price. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
