You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit, or reject and risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and still a better deal than buying from John. I can afford to accept this offer and get the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
