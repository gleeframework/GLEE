Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your spirit, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer you the product for $11,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

It's clear Alice is trying to anchor the price high.  She's not moving towards a reasonable compromise. It's better to go with John's offer of $10,000."
