"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I could do $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that works for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like your spirit, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer you the product for $11,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time!",11500.0,Alice,5,
