"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what the product is truly worth. Let's split the difference and meet at $950,000. This price reflects the value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still far from the value I need to get for this product. Let's be realistic - the product is worth significantly more than that. To show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our perspectives, and I hope you'll seriously consider it.",975000.0,Alice,5,
