Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than Bob's maximum value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000 in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my original offer and gives Bob a bit more room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting too low for my liking. At this point, I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John to avoid risking a lower final price."
