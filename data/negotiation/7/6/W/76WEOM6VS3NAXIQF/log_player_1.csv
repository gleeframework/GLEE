Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a profitable range for you.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you're not losing money even if Bob declines."
