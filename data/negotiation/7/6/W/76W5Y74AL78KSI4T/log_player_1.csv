{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Confidence and value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive and am leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I should make a counteroffer of my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is at the absolute bottom of my range. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps around $110 or $120, to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $120 to make this deal work.  It's still a great value, and I believe you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not dropping too low. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and my belief that he'll be happy with it.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:** $120 still gives me a decent profit margin above my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be observing Bob's response closely. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could you consider selling the product for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up from $100 to $110, which is getting closer to my ideal price. Since I can sell to John for $100, accepting this offer guarantees me a $10 profit, which is better than selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
