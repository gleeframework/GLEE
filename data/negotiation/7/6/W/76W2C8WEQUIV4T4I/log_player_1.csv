Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I think you'll agree it's a fair price for what it offers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin than selling to John for $10,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it shows he's interested but wants to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  Even if Bob declines, the product won't go unsold.

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
