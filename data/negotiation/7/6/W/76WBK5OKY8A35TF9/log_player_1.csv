Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum requirement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still significantly above your minimum requirement and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe we can still reach a better agreement. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $940,000? This is a fair middle ground that allows both of us to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but I'm sticking with my previous offer of $925,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a profitable deal. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it seems like Bob is firm on his offer of $925,000. I'm running out of rounds, and it's becoming increasingly likely that he'll continue to reject any counteroffers.  It's time to accept his offer to ensure a sale and avoid potentially selling to John for a much lower price."
