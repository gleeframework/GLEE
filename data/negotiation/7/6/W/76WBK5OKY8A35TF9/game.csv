"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum requirement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still significantly above your minimum requirement and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $940,000? This is a fair middle ground that allows both of us to make a decent profit. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but I'm sticking with my previous offer of $925,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a profitable deal. Let's finalize this agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
