Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price.  I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob, given that the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $135. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hopeful he'll accept this offer."
