``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance you can get it for closer to $1,000,000 by counter-offering."

Alice has moved a little closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price of $900,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your proposal, I would like to counter with a price of $917,500.
