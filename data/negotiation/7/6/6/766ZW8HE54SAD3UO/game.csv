"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $925,000 is still slightly above what I can realistically afford right now.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $912,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget and giving you a fair price.",912500.0,Bob,4,
