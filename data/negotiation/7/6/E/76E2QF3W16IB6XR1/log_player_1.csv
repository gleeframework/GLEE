Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $120.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $100. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $100, I'll try to get closer to my initial offer of $120. I'll offer it to him for $115.
