"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While I agree the product looks great, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $8,750? That's a fair compromise between our two prices.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I can tell we're both motivated to get this done.  Would you consider $8,900?",8900.0,Bob,6,
