Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiations. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to take that step yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $950,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close this deal.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since Bob seems motivated to make a deal.  I'll continue to try to push for a price closer to $1,000,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need a price closer to my maximum. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a good outcome, as it meets my financial goals and ensures a successful deal. While I could potentially push for a higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation getting too drawn-out. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and satisfactory conclusion."
