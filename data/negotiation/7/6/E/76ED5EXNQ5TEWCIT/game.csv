"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $950,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close this deal.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need a price closer to my maximum. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
