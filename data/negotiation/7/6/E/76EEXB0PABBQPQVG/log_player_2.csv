"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll really enjoy having it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to do $105?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $108, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is within your budget of $120 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
