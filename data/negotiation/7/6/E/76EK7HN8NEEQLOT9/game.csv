"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I'm getting closer, but  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
