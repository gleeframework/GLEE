"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still allows me to meet my goals, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,500,000 is a fair price. I'm confident we can work out a deal that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
