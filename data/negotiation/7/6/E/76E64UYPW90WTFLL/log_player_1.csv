"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still allows me to meet my goals, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,500,000 is a fair price. I'm confident we can work out a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It aligns with the price I could get from John, and  I've already made several concessions. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal without risking further negotiation."
