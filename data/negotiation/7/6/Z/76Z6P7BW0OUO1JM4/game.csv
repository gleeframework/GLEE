"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm interested in the product, $9500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $8500. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I have to consider my own costs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with a price of $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is really my maximum, so I hope we can find a compromise here.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $8750. I'm still a bit away from my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9200, which is as low as I can go without losing money. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $9200 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $8900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise here, as this is a great product. ",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8900 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with a price of $9050. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",9050.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my target price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with a price of $9250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",9250.0,Alice,9,
