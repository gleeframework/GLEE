Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  A counteroffer is the best course of action."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $1,200,000. A counteroffer might still result in a better price from Alice."

This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is close to his target price, she has already rejected two of his counteroffers.  It's likely he won't be able to get her down to his desired price, and buying from John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed deal within his budget."
