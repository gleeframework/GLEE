Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than $1,000,000, so this price is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** You can adjust your price slightly depending on Bob's response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is right at our initial offer, but we can aim higher. Since Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, we can try to get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

We're increasing the price by $25,000. This is a small increase, but it shows that we're not willing to settle for Bob's initial counteroffer.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to our desired price, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer secures a sale for $1,170,000, which is a good outcome considering our minimum was $1,000,000."
