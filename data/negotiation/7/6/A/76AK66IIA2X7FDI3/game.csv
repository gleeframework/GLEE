"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still being within a reasonable range for you.  Let's finalize this deal!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. Can we compromise on that price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
