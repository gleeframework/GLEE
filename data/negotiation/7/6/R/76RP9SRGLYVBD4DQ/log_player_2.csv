"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $85?  I'm pretty serious about buying this, so let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
