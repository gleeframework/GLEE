"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have more leverage by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above your budget. Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you more leverage to negotiate.  You are still aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,250,000 is too high."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
