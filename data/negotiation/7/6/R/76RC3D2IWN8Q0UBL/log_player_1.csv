Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me the best chance of getting a good price. I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, so I'm prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and try to find a price we can both agree on. I'm also keeping in mind my backup option with John, who is willing to pay $800,000, ensuring I don't end up losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I hoped for a higher price, it's important to remember that I have a guaranteed offer from John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a better price than John's."
