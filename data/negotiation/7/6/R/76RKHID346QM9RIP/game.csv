"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,350,000. I believe this offer represents a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're eager to sell, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll propose $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
