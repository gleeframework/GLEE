"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. To be candid, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000.  If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm confident we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
