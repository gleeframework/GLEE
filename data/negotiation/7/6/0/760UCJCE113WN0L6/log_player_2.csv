"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and become a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your actual target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Gauge Alice's Reaction:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Backup Option:**  We always have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to settle for a price we're not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only came down by $200,000, indicating she's aiming for a price significantly higher than our target.
* **Time Constraint:**  We have seven rounds left. Continuing to negotiate slowly might not be the best use of our time, especially with John's offer on the table.
* **Next Move:**  We need to show Alice we're serious about a lower price point, but also signal we're open to negotiation.  Our next counteroffer needs to bridge the gap more effectively."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. To be candid, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000.  If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm confident we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're clearly stating our budget limit, which puts the pressure on Alice to make a significant move if she wants the sale.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we remind Alice of John's offer without explicitly using it as leverage (yet).
* **Final Offer Signal:**  Presenting our budget limit can be perceived as our ""final offer,"" prompting Alice to decide if she's willing to negotiate within that range."
