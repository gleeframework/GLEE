"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but reasonable):**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and expresses confidence in a deal, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer sets the stage for potential counteroffers, allowing Alice to strategically concede while staying above her minimum acceptable price ($800,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.  Alice has room to negotiate and should aim to secure a price closer to $900,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she believes the product is worth more and is willing to negotiate further. This keeps the door open for a more favorable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value as justification for the higher price, subtly countering Bob's ""market demand"" point. 
* **Simplified Negotiation:** Proposing a clean $900,000 simplifies the negotiation and creates a clear point for Bob to consider.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Alice still has the option to negotiate further or accept John's offer if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $875,000 represents a significant profit margin above Alice's minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, signaling genuine interest and a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and risk losing the sale altogether. Securing a good offer now is preferable to an uncertain outcome later. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer on a slightly higher counter demonstrates goodwill and the potential for a positive future business relationship."
