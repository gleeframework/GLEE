Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might perceive its value to be even higher, especially if I present a compelling case for its benefits. 
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I haven't lost anything. I can proceed with selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
