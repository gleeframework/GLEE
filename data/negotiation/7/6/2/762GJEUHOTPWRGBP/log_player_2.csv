Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

Let's start with a lower offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a significant discount, but still within a reasonable range for a product worth $12,000 to me."

Alice is coming down on price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll reject her offer and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's split the difference and see if Alice is willing to meet me at $10,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John, and we've still got rounds to go if we need to negotiate further.  Let's accept this offer."
