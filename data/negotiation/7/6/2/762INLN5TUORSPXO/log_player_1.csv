Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is still above Bob's value of $800,000, giving him some wiggle room to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I can adjust my offer based on Bob's response and still have a guaranteed fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob by countering.
* **John is a Safe Option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is still above his value but lower than my initial offer. I will aim for a price that is closer to my target of $1,200,000 while leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Advantage:**  This price is still above Bob's offer of $850,000 and allows for further negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  I can still fall back on John's $1,200,000 offer if this negotiation fails. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my potential profits high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $825,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely to Yield Desired Results:**  Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer is a Secure Solution:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further time spent in potentially unproductive negotiations.

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, selling to John is the most financially sound decision at this point. It eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not be fruitful and ensures I meet my minimum profit target."
