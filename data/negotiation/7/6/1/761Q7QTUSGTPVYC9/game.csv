"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value your perspective, $1400000 is below the product's true worth. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000.  This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it still provides you with a valuable investment.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to secure the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it for $1550000. This is a firm price, considering the product's potential. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're still discussing this. However, $1250000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  With just a few rounds left, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm offering it for $1450000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal and get you the incredible benefits this product offers.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
