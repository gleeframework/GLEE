"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's within your budget, it's still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have a clear advantage here, as you know Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000.
* **John is a backup.** Having John as an alternative gives you leverage to push for a better price with Alice.
