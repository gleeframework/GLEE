"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $900000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $872500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and agree on $865000? It's a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",865000.0,Bob,6,
