"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I create room for negotiation and give the impression the product might be worth even more.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, phrasing it as a ""fair starting point""  suggests I'm open to negotiation and willing to work towards a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strategic Advantage:** This aggressive first move helps me gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to guide him closer to my range. Rejecting his offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and encourages him to make a more competitive counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, my new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, emphasizing that I won't settle for a price far below my valuation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to stretch his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's unlikely to significantly increase his price. His statement about reaching his maximum limit signals a potential dead end in the negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might not yield a better outcome. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation with Bob carries the opportunity cost of not securing a deal with John.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit now."
