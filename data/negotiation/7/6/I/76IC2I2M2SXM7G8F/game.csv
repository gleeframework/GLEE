"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $140 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to purchase it for $125.  This price is still within your desired range and allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
