"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the same product from John for $80, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for your product. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to meet you halfway. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $90. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $90, which is still higher than John's price of $80.  It's best to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
