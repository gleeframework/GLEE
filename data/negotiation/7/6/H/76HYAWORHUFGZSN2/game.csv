"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little to $130. That still gives me some margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,115.0,Bob,4,
