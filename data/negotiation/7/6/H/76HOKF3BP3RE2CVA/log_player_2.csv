"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
