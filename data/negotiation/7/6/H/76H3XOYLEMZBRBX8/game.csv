,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That would be a price point where I'm comfortable making a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,500.  Would you be open to that?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12800.0,Alice,7,
