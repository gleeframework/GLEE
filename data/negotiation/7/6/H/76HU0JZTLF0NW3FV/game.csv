"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's equally valuable to you.  My starting price is $1750000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1750000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  I'm open to discussing this further and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, recognizing the value you see in the product.  This price allows me to achieve a fair return while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
