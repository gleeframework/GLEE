Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need to make at least $1,000,000 to consider the deal worthwhile.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering $1,150,000 allows for a decent profit for me and still presents a good deal for Bob. It leaves $50,000 on the table for him, which is a fair margin to negotiate down. 

By offering this price, I am maximizing my chances of securing a higher price than John's offer while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
