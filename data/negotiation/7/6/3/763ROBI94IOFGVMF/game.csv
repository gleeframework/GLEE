"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price given the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
