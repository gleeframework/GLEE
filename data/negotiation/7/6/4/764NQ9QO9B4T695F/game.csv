"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to acquire the product without going over my limit. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,
