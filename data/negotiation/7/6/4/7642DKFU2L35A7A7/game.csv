"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $750,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be feasible?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $650,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product has for you.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Could we settle at $675,000?  That's a firm offer from my end.",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession: I'll include a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package worth $20,000. This is a unique opportunity to get the product with additional value, and I think it's worth considering. The price remains at $700,000.",700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for including the warranty and maintenance package. That adds value, but my budget is still a hard limit. For me to close the deal, I need the price to be $680,000. This is my final offer.",680000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in an additional $10,000 worth of customization to the product. This will make it even more tailored to your specific needs. The price remains at $700,000, and I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a unique product that meets your requirements.",700000.0,Alice,9,
