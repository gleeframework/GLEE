"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and while I value it at significantly more, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount and allows you to realize substantial value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer who is ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
