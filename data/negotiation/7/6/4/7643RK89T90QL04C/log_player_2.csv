You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above your budget. It's best to reject and counter-offer to see if you can get a better price. You still have 9 rounds left, and you could potentially save a lot of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious interest in the product while pushing for a price within your budget.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
