Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which would still be a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
