"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which would still be a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
