"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you. I understand its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm confident this transaction will be mutually beneficial. Please consider my offer of $900,000.  This price is significantly higher than what I could get from another buyer, but I believe in the value of our potential partnership. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price.
