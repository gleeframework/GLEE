,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $140? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more than I initially offered, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
