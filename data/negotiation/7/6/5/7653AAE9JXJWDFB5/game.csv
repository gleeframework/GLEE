"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000?  This is still below what I'd like to get, but it shows my commitment to working with you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm open to $825,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
