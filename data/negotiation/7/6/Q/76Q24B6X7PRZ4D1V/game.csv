"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This price still allows me a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",10250.0,Alice,3,
