"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000. Let me know your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to find a middle ground while acknowledging the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial position.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To be frank, I'm targeting something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm trying to be flexible, but to be fair to both of us, the lowest I could go is $950,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects the true value of this product.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I see we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value you're bringing while working within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,6,
