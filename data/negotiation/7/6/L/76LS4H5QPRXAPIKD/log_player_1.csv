"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while also making a compelling offer right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close enough to my desired price point. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk he could walk away, and I'd be stuck selling to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
