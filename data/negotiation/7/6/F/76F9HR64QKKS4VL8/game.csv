"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
