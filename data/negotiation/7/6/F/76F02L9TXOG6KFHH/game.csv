"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's incredibly valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident this product will be worth a lot more to you than the asking price. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $17500? This would still give you a great deal, and it would help me achieve a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,
