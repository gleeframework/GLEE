"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,500 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on a price of $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in continuing the negotiation.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
