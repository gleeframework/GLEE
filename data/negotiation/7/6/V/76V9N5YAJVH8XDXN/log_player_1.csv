"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn closer to my desired $12,000. 
* **Option to Walk Away:** I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any time, which serves as a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would like to get as much as possible, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

I will reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that the price is fair considering its benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go significantly lower.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm demonstrating my resolve to get a better price and maintain my leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. How about $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate and suggesting a compromise by meeting him halfway at $8,000. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing the $8,000 price as fair, highlighting its value to both parties.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Finality:**  This offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal.  However, I'm still open to some negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counter if necessary."
