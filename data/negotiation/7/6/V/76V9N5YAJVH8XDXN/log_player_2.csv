"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a better price before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's opening ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Polite and Open:** My message is polite and expresses my interest in the product while clearly stating my budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to get the price as close to my ideal price ($8,000) or lower as possible. This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to pay $500 more than John's price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her closer to $8,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. How about $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm aiming for a price close to the midpoint between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($6,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still moving towards my target.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""ready to close the deal,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure and signaling that this offer might be my final one before considering John's deal seriously.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm continuing to use positive language (""appreciate you working with me"") to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price! There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they are both offering the same price now. It's time to accept the deal."
