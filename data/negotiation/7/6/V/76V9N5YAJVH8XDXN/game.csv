"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. How about $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
