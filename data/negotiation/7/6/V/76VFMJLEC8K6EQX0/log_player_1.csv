{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances the following:

* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit, getting as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:**  The price is within his acceptable range, making it likely he'll consider it.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves room for both you and Bob to adjust the price during potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to do business with you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum value of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price, potentially getting closer to your target.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still not able to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
