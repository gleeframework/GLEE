"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $91. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think!",91.0,Alice,5,
