"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is better than $100, it's still more than what Bob is willing to spend. He wants to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $91. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to buy the product.  $91 is a decent compromise, and getting the product for less than $100 is a win for Bob.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal to John. It's time to accept and get the product."
