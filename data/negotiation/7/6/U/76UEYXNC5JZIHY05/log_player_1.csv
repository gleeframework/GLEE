Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand,"" Alice creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, justifying the high price. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**: This phrasing subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, adding a touch of urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation style:** This offer assumes Alice doesn't have specific information about how Bob negotiates. If she knew he was very price-sensitive, she might start lower but still above $800,000.
* **Relationship building:**  If a long-term business relationship is important to Alice, she might adjust her opening price to be less aggressive."
