"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's serious interest in the product but also his determination to secure a good deal.  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise that leaves Alice with a profit above her minimum while allowing Bob to save significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the significant value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer and brings the price closer to Bob's ideal.  This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $175,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of trying to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and finalizes the deal."
