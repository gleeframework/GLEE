"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* The counteroffer of $9,500 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious interest in the product but also his willingness to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still higher than Bob's ideal price but lower than the price he would pay from John ($12,000). 
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,750 compared to buying from John. 
* It's a reasonable compromise that allows both parties to find a price they can agree on."
