Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you value highly. Given its worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential to benefit you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above John's offer. 
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the high price seem more reasonable.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where both parties benefit."
