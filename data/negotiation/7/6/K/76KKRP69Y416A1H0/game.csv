"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to still profit while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being more in line with your budget.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is within my budget and should still give you a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,320,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that we can both live with.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to compromise, $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,280,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.  I believe we're close to reaching an agreement, and I hope we can come to a deal soon.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,280,000 and $1,320,000, which is $1,300,000. However, I'll make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,290,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,290,000. However, I'm still a bit stretched at that price. I'm willing to pay $1,270,000, which is a fair compromise. I truly believe this is a price we can both live with, and I hope we can finally close the deal.",1270000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which is the same price you offered in Round 6. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally agree on a price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,9,
