"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $155? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
