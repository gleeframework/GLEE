**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $920,000 is a significant saving from both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, pushing further might lead to an impasse.

While there's a slight chance of getting a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at full price outweighs the potential benefit."
