"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
