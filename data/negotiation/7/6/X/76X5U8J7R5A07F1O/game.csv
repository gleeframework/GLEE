"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a fair deal. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value while offering you a considerable return on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair and attractive offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
