Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. Would you be interested in learning more about it? "", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm offering the product to Bob at $150 because that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since John is willing to pay $150, I have no incentive to offer a lower price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but I'm prepared to sell it to John if he doesn't."
