"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in purchasing but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that reflects the product's value to me within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
