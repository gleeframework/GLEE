"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). You can potentially save money by negotiating a lower price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to negotiating a lower price. It also leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for a win-win situation where you can buy the product at a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still above your ideal target. There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and it's worth continuing to try to reach a more favorable agreement.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise but still trying to stay within your budget. It also presents the negotiation as a collaborative process, focusing on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
