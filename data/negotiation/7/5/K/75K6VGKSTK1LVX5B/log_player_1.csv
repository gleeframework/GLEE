"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($150) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $120 to get the product. By starting high, I can potentially get a better deal while still leaving room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I want to get as close to my minimum as possible, I also want to leave room for further negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is still a little too low for me. How about $160?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $160. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting that it's a ""fair price"" for both of us. This aims to make the counteroffer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still feels the price is too high.  

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob will find this counteroffer more reasonable and be willing to close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll continue to negotiate with him, but I'll also consider the option of selling to John if the deal doesn't progress quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $150? That's a fair price considering your willingness to come down. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Further Gains:** There's no point in rejecting his offer and trying to get a higher price because I can sell to John for the same amount.
* **Closing the Deal:** By accepting Bob's offer, I close the deal and secure the minimum profit I'm looking for. 

**Strategy:** While I'd prefer to get more than $150, it's not worth risking losing the deal and ending up with no sale. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a successful transaction and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
