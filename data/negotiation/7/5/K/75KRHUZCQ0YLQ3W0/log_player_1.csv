``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to potentially negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's also important to acknowledge that I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay the minimum I'd accept, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember that the product is worth at least $12,000 to me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
