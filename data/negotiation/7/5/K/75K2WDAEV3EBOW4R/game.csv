"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my best offer, as I know I can find other interested buyers at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially do $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
