"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",82.5,Bob,4,
