I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also demonstrating that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm getting closer to my minimum but haven't secured a deal.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better deal for me. I'm going to sell to John."
