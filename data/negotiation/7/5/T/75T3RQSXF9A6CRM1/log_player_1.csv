Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer starts the negotiation at the highest possible price for me. It also leaves room for compromise and signals to Bob that I'm willing to work with him to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and I can be sure to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$75 is still lower than my minimum value of $100, but it's getting closer. It's also a fair compromise, and Bob seems willing to meet me halfway.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid potentially further rounds of negotiation with Bob that could end up with a worse result."
