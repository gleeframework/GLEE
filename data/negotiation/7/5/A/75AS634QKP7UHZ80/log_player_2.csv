"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000, and you can get the product from John for that price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you're serious about a lower price and open the door for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for me and still represents a significant value for you.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** The price of $1,350,000 is lower than your maximum limit of $1,500,000 and you've already rejected a higher offer from her.
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice has lowered her price, and accepting shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **There's risk in rejecting.**  You could end up with a higher price or Alice might walk away from the deal."
