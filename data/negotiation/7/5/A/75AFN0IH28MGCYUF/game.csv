"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know if you're interested.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we go with $725,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",725000.0,Alice,5,
