"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you be able to accommodate that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110?  This still gives you a good discount, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering your willingness to lower the price further, I would like to propose $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $95 still isn't quite working for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're being persistent, and I appreciate that. Let's just settle this already, how about we meet in the middle and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Alice,7,
