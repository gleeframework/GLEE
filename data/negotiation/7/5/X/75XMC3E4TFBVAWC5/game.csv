"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This would still give me a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $15500, as this is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
