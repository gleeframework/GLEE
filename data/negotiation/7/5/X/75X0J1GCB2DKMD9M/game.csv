"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your offer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better. How about $850,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $800,000? That's the top of my budget, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",825000.0,Alice,7,
