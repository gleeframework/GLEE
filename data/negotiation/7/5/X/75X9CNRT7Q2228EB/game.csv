"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000?  That would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $7,000. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. How about we meet at $12,000? This is my last offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
