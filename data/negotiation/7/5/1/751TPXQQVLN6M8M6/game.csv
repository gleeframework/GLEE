"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your company. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $950000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefit to your organization.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
