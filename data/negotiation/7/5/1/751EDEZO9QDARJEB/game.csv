"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get from the sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I'm  firmly set on $850,000. This is a fair price given the value we both see in this product, and it's the most I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",850000.0,Bob,4,
