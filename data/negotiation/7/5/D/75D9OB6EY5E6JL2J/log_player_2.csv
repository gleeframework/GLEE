"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, you can still get it cheaper from John for $100.  Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
