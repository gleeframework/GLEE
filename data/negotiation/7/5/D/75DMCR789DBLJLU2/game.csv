"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This gives you a good deal, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still unable to meet at $14,000. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $12,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,5,
