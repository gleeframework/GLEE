"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
