"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, $1,800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you consider $2,100,000?  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
