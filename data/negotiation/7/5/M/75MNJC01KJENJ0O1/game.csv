,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what the product is worth to you.  Let's get this done.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",9750.0,Alice,7,
