"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $12,000.  This is a significant discount from what I would get elsewhere.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He can get the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal."
