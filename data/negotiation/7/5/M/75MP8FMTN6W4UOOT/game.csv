"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you want to get a fair price, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $10,750?  That's a reasonable compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and my original offer of $11,500. How about we try $11,125? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the value the product will bring to you.",11125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems we're close.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $10,937.50?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10937.5,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,937.50. I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we try $11,250? It's still a compromise, but I believe it's worth it for the value the product will bring to you.",11250.0,Alice,7,
