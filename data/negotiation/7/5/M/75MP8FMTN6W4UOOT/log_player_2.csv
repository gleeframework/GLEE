Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and my original offer of $11,500. How about we try $11,125? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the value the product will bring to you.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very slowly decreasing her offer price, and it's unlikely you'll get her much lower than $11,250. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the additional time and effort negotiating. John's offer of $12,000 is a reasonable alternative."
