Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make on this product. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means going a few more rounds with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $15,500? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I still have time to make a better deal, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14,250 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. How about $14,000? This is my best and final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident I can get a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. I need to be persistent and push for a more favorable deal."

This is getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm worried we're going to run out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
