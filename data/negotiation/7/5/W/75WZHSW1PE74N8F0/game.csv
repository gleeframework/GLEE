"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $800000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing the value of the product. I hope you'll consider this offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
