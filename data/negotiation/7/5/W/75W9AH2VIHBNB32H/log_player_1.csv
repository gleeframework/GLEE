"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000, which is still a premium price for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm holding firm on getting a price that reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a compromise: how about $1,025,000? This recognizes the value while acknowledging your budget concerns."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to the $1 million mark, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. We're getting into the later rounds, so I need to apply a bit more pressure while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I am increasing the pressure on Bob. This tactic could lead him to accept or propose a counteroffer closer to my desired outcome. By being firm yet still offering a compromise, I aim to secure a deal above $1 million."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,010,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $980,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you make a decision? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has indicated that $980,000 is his absolute maximum, and we're running out of rounds. While we could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
