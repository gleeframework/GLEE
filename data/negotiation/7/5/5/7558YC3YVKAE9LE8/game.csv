"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",90.0,Bob,4,
