"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $80. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $90. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to meet you at $110. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
