``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired $1,500,000. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation, making it seem like a win-win situation for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to buy it from you.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer to try and get a better price before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to $1,200,000 with another counteroffer before selling to John."
