"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to buy it from you. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
