"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering it's still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's continue working towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not ready to accept $1,100,000. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be confident that this is a deal that works for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
