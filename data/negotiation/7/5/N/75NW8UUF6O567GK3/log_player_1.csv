Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to consider the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, which is better than losing the sale entirely.
* By starting high, I create an opportunity for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer with a lower price, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
