"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $800000.  This product is worth that much to you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's not waste any more time.  If you're serious about buying, accept this offer.  Otherwise, I'll move on to other buyers.",800000.0,Alice,5,
