# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $1,400,000. This means she is willing to lose some value to make a deal. It's likely she will be open to negotiating further, especially since your goal is to buy it for no more than $800,000. Rejecting her offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential to save more money."

Alice's final offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While I do want this product, I'm not ready to pay that much yet. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."

While Alice is getting closer to my target, $1,150,000 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise, but if she doesn't budge, I'll go with John."
