Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a reasonable price. It's higher than his perceived value but still lower than my guaranteed sale price to John. This could incentivize Bob to accept, giving me a higher profit than selling to John."
