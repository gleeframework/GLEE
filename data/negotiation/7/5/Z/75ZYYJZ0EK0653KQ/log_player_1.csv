Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which reflects its unique qualities. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good middle ground. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I'm confident the product is worth more, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I still believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to make a further concession. I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I can accept while still ensuring a fair return.  I'm confident this price is still a good value for you considering the product's worth.
