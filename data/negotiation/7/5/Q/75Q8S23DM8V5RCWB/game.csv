"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to bring it down to a more reasonable range. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's try $10500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good balance between our two numbers.",10500.0,Alice,5,
