"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation without immediately appearing unreasonable. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** This gives me ample opportunity to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **By rejecting the offer, I maintain my leverage.**  It signals that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to Round 3 and counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price that is closer to my desired price of $15,000, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting to meet in the middle, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my position.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting that $10,250 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations, or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $9,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's moved slightly closer to my desired price,  $9,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **We are still early in the negotiation.** We have 6 rounds left, which is ample time to try and reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage is important.** By rejecting the offer, I maintain my position and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to Round 5 and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I will likely try to meet in the middle again, but with a higher starting point than before."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again, and I'm willing to go down to $9,625. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** We're still early in the negotiation process, and I want to keep the conversation going.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this offer is closer to Bob's, it's still above his last offer and within my acceptable range.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,625 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,250 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" is a Bluff:** Bob's statement that this is his ""final offer"" is likely a tactic to pressure me into accepting. 
* **Time is on My Side:** We have 4 rounds remaining, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **John is a Safe Option:** If I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for a much higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above his. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too low.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess the situation based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining. If he continues to be unreasonable, I will sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this offer, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $9,437.50. This is a very reasonable price, considering the quality of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 9437.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:** I'm demonstrating a continued willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning the limited number of rounds remaining subtly creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product, hoping to sway him towards accepting my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his next counteroffer very carefully.  I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation, so I need to weigh the potential of reaching a deal with Bob against the guaranteed offer from John."
