"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1,500,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's potential value and highlighting the opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to engage in conversation. 

**Important Note:**  This is a high-risk strategy. If Bob sees the price as unreasonable, he may walk away.  However, starting high allows for more negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. I am willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is significant, I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price, especially considering the value I place on the product. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but it's not the most profitable.  I want to explore if a better deal is possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price still reflects the product's significant value and would make this a very worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer and Justification:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm explaining my reasoning for the price to keep the negotiation fair and transparent.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the potential benefits for him.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm using language that encourages further discussion and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I'd like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for improvement.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still aiming for a higher price and believe that I can get it. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John now would be a safe bet, but it's not my most desirable outcome. 

**Next Steps:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a final price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. We're definitely moving in the right direction! Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $1,380,000? It's a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.  I'm confident this product will bring you great returns."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's in the middle of our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm still highlighting the product's potential value and benefits for Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'm hopeful that this offer will be accepted by Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in coming down on the price, Alice. I think $1375000 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price range, and it's only $5,000 less than my previous counteroffer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  
* **Significant Profit:** Accepting this offer would still yield a significant profit compared to selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer, ensuring a profitable sale and closing the deal."
