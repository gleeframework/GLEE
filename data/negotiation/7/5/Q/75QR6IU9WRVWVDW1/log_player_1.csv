{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for a counteroffer, showing flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll switch to John to secure the $10,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I'm interested in making a purchase, but at a more reasonable cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  This suggests he's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting his counteroffer, I can potentially push for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Avoiding Minimum:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be the least desirable outcome.  I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial price, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll keep in mind that if the negotiation stalls, I have the option of selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work. Would you consider $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to maximize my earnings. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing justification for my price by stating it's fair for both of us.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm not giving in completely, but I'm also not completely inflexible.

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.
* If he accepts, I will finalize the deal.
* If he rejects, I will need to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to consider $13000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs and expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is not worth it.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation could be time-consuming and ultimately lead to a lower price or a lost deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This outcome is favorable, as it ensures a sale at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
