# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and even higher than her own valuation. John offers a much better deal at $8,000."
