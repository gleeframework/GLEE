Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It leaves no room for ambiguity.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer.
* **Maximize your potential profit:** You can potentially negotiate a price closer to your minimum if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Maintain control:** You can always walk away and sell to John for your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum.** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still far below the $15,000 you could get from John.
* **You have room for negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** You can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his $9,000 offer but still below your $12,000 initial offer. This will show him that you are willing to negotiate but also maintain your value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum.**  While you'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is only $5,000 below your minimum. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant gains.**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and pushing for a higher price might risk him walking away.
* **The risk of losing a sale is high.**  You could potentially keep negotiating, but there's a chance that Bob will walk away entirely.  

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a sale at a price that's still reasonably close to your desired value.  While you could potentially get more from John, the risk of losing a sale and the uncertainty of future negotiations outweigh the potential gain."
