"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm on a tight budget, and that's the most I can afford.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're close, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, so how about $87.50? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",87.5,Bob,6,
