Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is quite a bit lower than my initial ask, but it's still a significant profit. I need to weigh the potential of getting closer to my desired price against the risk of losing the sale altogether.
