"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value. While your offer is enticing, I'm looking for a price point closer to $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
