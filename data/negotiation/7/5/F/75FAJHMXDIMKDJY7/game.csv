"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your offer is significantly below its true value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept such a low price.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I still think we can find a better price. Considering your initial offer was $1,400,000 and my previous offer was $700,000, I'll meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
