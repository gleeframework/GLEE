"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a good anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $100,000 below Bob's value leaves space for him to feel like he can negotiate a better deal, encouraging him to stay engaged. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The language used conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

The goal here is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob remains interested in the deal rather than walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant profit, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to pay a premium for the product. Rejecting at this point keeps the door open for securing a higher price, closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a number that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,350,000? This reflects my commitment to making this deal happen while acknowledging the product's significant value."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and willingness to compromise, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Holding Firm on Value:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, the message still emphasizes the product's value to justify a price above $1,300,000.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  The language aims to create a sense of collaboration (""find a number that works for both of us"") and encourage Bob to accept."
