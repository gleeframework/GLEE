"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for your business. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to the highest possible price. She knows it's your maximum and is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting her offer.  You can always buy from John at the same price, or try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
