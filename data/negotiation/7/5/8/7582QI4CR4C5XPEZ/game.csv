"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on it.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,800, which is a fair compromise considering both of our positions.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,800. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I place on the product. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to prioritize your interests, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $8,900. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $9,050. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests.",9050.0,Alice,9,
