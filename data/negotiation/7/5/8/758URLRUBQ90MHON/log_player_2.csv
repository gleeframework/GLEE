**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **Better option:** Reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price. There's a chance to get the product for less, even if it means more negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $115, which is closer to Bob's limit, but still too high.
* **Better option:** Reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price. Even though it's closer to Bob's limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might lower her price, and Bob can always fall back on John if he needs to."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $112, which is slightly above Bob's ideal price but still within his acceptable range.
* **Better option:**  Accept Alice's offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will refuse to budge further and Bob will end up paying John $120.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's still a good deal compared to John."
