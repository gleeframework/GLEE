"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's worth a lot to me, but I know you'd get a lot of use out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you know you have a backup option with John. There's a chance you can get a better price by negotiating with Alice or going with John."
