"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no urgency to accept the first offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my interest. I'm really excited about the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob is aiming for a significant price drop, but $8,500 is still a reasonable offer considering Alice's minimum acceptable price is $8,000.

* **Potential for Compromise:** The counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, giving Alice a chance to respond with a counter-counteroffer."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for a lower price. While Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a slight improvement from her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice and signals his willingness to walk away if necessary."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
