Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $14,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation but higher than Bob's.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, giving her leverage.

**The Offer:**

* **$14,500** is a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for Alice to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **""Special price""** and **""limited-time offer""** create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice makes a great profit of $14,500.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice can decide if she wants to accept a slightly lower price or move on to John.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells the product to John for her guaranteed $15,000."
