"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $975,000. This price still reflects a significant profit for me, while also being reasonable considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
