"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll agree that this is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **It's still a good deal for you.** You're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."
