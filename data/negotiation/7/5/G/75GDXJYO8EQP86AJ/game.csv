"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,600,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
