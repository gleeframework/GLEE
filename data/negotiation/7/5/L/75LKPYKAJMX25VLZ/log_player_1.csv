"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception of value.
* **Leaving Room:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, starting at $16,000 leaves a good amount of room for negotiation towards a price that is beneficial for both parties. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and give you insights into his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is still significantly above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, you can assess how flexible Bob is willing to be on price. It's possible he's willing to go higher.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum, so there's no risk of losing out on a sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Countering with $15,000 positions the negotiation as a compromise. It shows willingness to move from your initial price while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Maintaining Value:**  You're avoiding a drastic price drop, which reinforces the product's perceived value. 
* **Encouraging a Response:**  By suggesting a specific price, you encourage Bob to respond with either an acceptance or a counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** While $13,000 is below your initial target, it's still a $1,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price. This represents a decent return.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in purchasing the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the process. Accepting now secures the sale and allows you to move on to other potential deals."
