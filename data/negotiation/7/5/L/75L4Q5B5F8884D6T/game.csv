"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, that price is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $18,000. I believe this price reflects the value while still offering you a competitive advantage.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could make a move up to $9,500.  Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below the product's market value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more serious offer from your side to continue this negotiation. I'm proposing $16,000, which is a firm offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has a good market value, but I have a strict budget. I can go up to $10,000, but that's my limit. It's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for that price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
