"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  $900,000 is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is still a decent profit, it's lower than my desired target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a significant profit. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation. It's a fair price for both of us."
