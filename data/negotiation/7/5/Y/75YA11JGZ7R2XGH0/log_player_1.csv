Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes a strong perceived value of the product.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright at $15,000. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially gain an extra $5,000."
