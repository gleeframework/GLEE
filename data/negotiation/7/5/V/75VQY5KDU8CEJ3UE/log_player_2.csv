"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good deal. However, you can get the product for $100 from John if you reject Alice's offer.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the better option."
