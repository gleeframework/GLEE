Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice is guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he'd benefit by up to $200,000 if he gets a good deal.

**The Offer**

Alice needs to maximize her profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own this unique product. I value it highly, but I believe it can bring you even greater value. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Strategy Works**

* **Targeting Bob's Gain:** This price point allows Bob to gain $50,000 from the transaction, a significant incentive to accept.
* **Maximizing Alice's Profit:** Alice secures $150,000 more than her guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a fluid process.  Bob could counter-offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate slightly downward but hold firm closer to her $1,100,000 minimum acceptable price."
