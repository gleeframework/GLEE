"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? That's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
