Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What would you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of our previous discussions, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
