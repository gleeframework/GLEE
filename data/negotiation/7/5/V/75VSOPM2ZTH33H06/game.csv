"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What would you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of our previous discussions, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
