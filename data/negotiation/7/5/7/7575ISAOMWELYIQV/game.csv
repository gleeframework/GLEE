"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, if I do say so myself!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again - how about $115? This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'll make one more offer to you - I'll sell the product to you for $120. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
