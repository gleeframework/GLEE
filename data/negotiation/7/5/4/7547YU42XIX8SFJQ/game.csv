"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you.  What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $150. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but $130 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
