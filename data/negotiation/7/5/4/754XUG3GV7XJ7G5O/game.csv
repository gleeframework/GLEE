"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $10500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $10200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but I'm still not convinced that $10200 is a good deal. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000, Bob. I've already given you a significant discount, and I'm not willing to sacrifice any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $9800, which would be $9900. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9900.0,Alice,9,
