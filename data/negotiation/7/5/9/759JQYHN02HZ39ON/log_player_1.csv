"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low. How about $85?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $78. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, but still acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference. How about $81? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I've had five rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned we may not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me $80, which is my minimum."
