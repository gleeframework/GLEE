"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, considering my maximum purchase limit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product is worth a lot, but my maximum budget remains $1000000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm happy to finalize the purchase at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. Considering the value I've already compromised on, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
