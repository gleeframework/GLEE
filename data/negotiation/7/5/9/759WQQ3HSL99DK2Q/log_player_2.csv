Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I can go down to $82, but that's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $82.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's in your best interest to take that deal and save the extra $2."
