``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.

Round 2

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I want to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
