"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000."
