"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for a product like this.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $8,750? I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
