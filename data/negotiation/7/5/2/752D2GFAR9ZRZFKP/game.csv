"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $950000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
