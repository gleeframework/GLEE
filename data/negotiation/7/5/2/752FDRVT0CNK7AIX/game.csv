"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I'm interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make sure you get a fair price, and I'm trying to do the same.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,000. However, I was thinking we could do even better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm also willing to throw in a special bonus that's worth $250. This way, you'll get the product for $11,000, and I'll also include the bonus, making the total value even higher. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
