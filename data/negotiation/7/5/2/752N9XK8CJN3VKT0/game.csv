"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start with this and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds $850,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's seal the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
