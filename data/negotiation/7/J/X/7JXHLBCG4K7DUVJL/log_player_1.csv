Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose $16,500 as a compromise. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $16,500 secures a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
