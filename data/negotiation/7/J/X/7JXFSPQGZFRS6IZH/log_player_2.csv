Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is your budget, Bob. However, I've already gone below my desired price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $100. I can offer the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to negotiate, she's unlikely to go down to $100. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further and potentially losing the deal altogether."
