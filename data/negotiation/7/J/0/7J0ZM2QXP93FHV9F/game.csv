,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8500? This would still give you a good deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8250 is still slightly too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8375?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
