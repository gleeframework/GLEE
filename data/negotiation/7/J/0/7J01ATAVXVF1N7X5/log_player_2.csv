Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers, and I truly believe it's the fairest price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to find common ground. However, $1000000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
