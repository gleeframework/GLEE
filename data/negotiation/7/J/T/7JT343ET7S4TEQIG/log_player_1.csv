"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This initial offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good opening message to start a conversation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $110. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $115 is close enough to my goal and higher than John's offer. It's a good compromise, and it's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiations and potentially lose the deal altogether."
