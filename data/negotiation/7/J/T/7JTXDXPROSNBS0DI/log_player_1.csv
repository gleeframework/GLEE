"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain a better understanding of Bob's position.
* **Confident Presentation:** Highlighting the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price is crucial.  
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, which is important for fostering a productive exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While the product has potential, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $1,300,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only round 2. There's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial, and my original pricing reflects its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $200,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further adjustments. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:**  Framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're invested in this product. However, $1,800,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price recognizes the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets your absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating a strong desire to acquire the product. 
* **No Guarantee of More:** While you might be able to extract a slightly higher price from Bob, there's no guarantee, and you risk him walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
