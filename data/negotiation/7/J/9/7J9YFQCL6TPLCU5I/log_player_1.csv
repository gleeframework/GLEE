Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $99. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob refuses. 

Offering the product at $99 tempts Bob with a small ""discount"" while still securing almost the maximum profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell it to John without any loss."
