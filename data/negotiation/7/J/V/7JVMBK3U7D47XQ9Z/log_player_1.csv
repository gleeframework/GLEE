Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum price and John's offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $13,000 is a round number that feels less arbitrary than, say, $12,999, but not as high as $14,000 which might scare Bob off.

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. You have a strong backup offer from John, but securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the ideal outcome."
