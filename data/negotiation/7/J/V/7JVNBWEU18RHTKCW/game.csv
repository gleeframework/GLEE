"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $950000 is below what I can accept at this time.  Considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to compromise slightly. I propose a price of $1050000. This reflects a fair balance for both of us. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to your business, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
