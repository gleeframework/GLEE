Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:**  Using a friendly tone could encourage Bob to consider the offer and engage in further negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** The offer allows for a potential compromise that benefits both parties.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it, always considering the $15,000 offer from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $11,000 is above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll carefully consider his next offer and my options. If it's still too low, I'll either make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price. 

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $15,000."
