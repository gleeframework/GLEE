,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $125, and that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to make this deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'd be willing to pay $128, and that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",128.0,Bob,6,
