"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its significant potential.  I'm asking $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to realize substantial gains while also providing me with a solid return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
