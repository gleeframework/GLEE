"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $150 is just below my minimum for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $175? This would still be a good price for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $160.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",160.0,Bob,4,
