"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and even less than my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counter-offer is closer to Alice's value ($80) than my maximum price ($100). This might make her more likely to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving towards a more agreeable price. I want to see if I can negotiate a bit further down before considering accepting. I'm still within a comfortable range of my $100 maximum."

{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($85) and my previous offer ($70). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to a sense of fairness in the negotiation.
* **Staying below $80:** I'm still aiming for a price below Alice's perceived value of the product."
