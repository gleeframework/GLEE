Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant time and resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but just below my guaranteed sale price to John. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's potential benefits and long-term value aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus from the immediate cost. 
* **Urgency (implied):**  By not mentioning John, I create an implicit sense of urgency. Bob might feel compelled to act quickly to avoid missing out, even though he doesn't know about my alternative buyer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of him rejecting the offer outright."
