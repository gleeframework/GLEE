"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe its value to you aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm asking for $1400000, which is a fair price considering its potential for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure a deal at a lower price point. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This would give us both a fair and mutually beneficial outcome. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1200000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price and leaves some room for profit for Alice.  Continuing to negotiate risks going over the 10 round limit and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
