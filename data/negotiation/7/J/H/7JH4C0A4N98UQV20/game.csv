"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm comfortable paying $1,250,000 for the product. This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and move on.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. So, the total price would be $1,280,000 for the product and $20,000 for the maintenance package, making it a total of $1,300,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,7,
