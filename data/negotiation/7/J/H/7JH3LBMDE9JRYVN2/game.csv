"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the gap between our valuations is still quite wide.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
