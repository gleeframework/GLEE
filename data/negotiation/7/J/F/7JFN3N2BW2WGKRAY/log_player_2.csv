Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is Alice's bottom line, as she values the product at $800,000. Accepting her offer is the best choice in this round, as it allows you to purchase the product at a price lower than John's and at a reasonable price for you.  It's important to remember that while you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product."
