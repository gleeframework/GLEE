{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $900,000 is a starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $1,000,000. I'd like to propose $920,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

While $920,000 is a bit better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $920,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $930,000 or lower. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Although $930,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $930,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at $940,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but it seems he's not willing to budge much further.  With only two rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement. Rather than risk getting a lower price or failing to make a deal, I'm going to accept John's offer of $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
