"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some bargaining power.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get from owning it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question, leaving the door open for a counteroffer and further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his previous stance, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for further negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **No need to rush to John:**  John's offer is a good safety net, but it's not yet time to give up on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low. I can come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a slight concession:** I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth and justifying the price.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm suggesting finding a middle ground, implying a willingness to continue the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from $18,000 to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but still too low:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can potentially get a better deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a backup:** John's offer is a safe option if I can't get a better deal from Bob. But, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last counteroffer, as I'm now at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing finality:**  The ""absolute minimum"" phrasing underscores that this is my final offer.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm directly suggesting a close to the negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is a sure bet at my desired price, and I'm not interested in further negotiation with Bob at this point."
