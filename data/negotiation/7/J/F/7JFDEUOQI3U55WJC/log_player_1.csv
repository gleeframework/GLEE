Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is stuck at the lower end of his budget and doesn't seem likely to move much higher than $90. It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Taking the guaranteed $100 from John is the best move at this point."
