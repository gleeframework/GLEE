{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me, but still below what I would get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob than to John, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $150?  I think that's fair considering what the product is worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go to $135.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price,  $135 is still a bit lower than what I would get from John. I'll counteroffer again, hopefully getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
