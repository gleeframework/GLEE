"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's make this deal happen.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our time invested in negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
