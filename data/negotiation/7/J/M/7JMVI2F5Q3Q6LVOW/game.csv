,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140? That gives us both a good deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I don't want to miss out on the chance to sell to you.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a little out of my price range.  I can go up to $132, which is the very most I can afford.  Let's close this deal!",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133. This is a great deal for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",133.0,Alice,7,
