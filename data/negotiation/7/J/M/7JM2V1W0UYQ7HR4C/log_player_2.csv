Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $97 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway, and I think I can do a bit better. I'm willing to offer it to you for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting at $102 gets you a decent discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
