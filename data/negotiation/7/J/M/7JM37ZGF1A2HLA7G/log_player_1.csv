Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while still being a significant profit. 
* **Scarcity & Urgency:**  The message hints at other potential buyers (""limited-time offer"", ""other interested parties"") to nudge Bob towards a quicker decision. 
* **Value Justification:** The message briefly mentions ""value and potential"" to subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge his interest and potentially lower it. However, always keep your $800,000 safety net (John's offer) in mind."
