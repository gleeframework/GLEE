"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in this product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about we start at $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $130 is still a bit more than my budget allows. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $127.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,5,
