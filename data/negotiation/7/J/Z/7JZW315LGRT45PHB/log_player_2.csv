"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  Since his maximum budget is $8,000, he's going to start by offering that price.  This establishes a clear boundary and puts pressure on Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still outside his budget.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower, but rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open.  Bob can try to counter with a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He knows his maximum is $8,000, and Alice has come down to $10,000. Offering $9,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range for Bob. It also increases the pressure on Alice to come down further if she wants to make a deal."
