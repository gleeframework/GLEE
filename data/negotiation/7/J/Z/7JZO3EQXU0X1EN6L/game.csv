"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $250 and $180, which would be $215. What do you think?",215.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget with $215. Would you be willing to go down to $190? I think that's a fair price for the product.,190.0,Bob,4,
