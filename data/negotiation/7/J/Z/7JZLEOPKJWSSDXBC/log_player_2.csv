"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice in negotiation to start with an offer lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Significant Difference:** $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a profitable price for her ($300,000 profit). This leaves room for her to counter if she's completely unwilling to go that low. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, we have John as a backup option at $1,000,000.  We need to make sure our negotiations with Alice don't lead us too close to that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, her price is still too close to John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  There's a chance we can get Alice closer to $1,000,000 if we hold firm for another round. 
* **Walk-Away Point:**  It's important to establish a firm ""walk-away"" point.  Let's see if Alice is willing to go lower, but we should be prepared to buy from John if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000. I believe that's a fair compromise and reflects the value I place on the product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Slightly):** This offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're not budging significantly. A $50,000 increase is a smaller concession than her $50,000 decrease, putting some pressure on her.
* **Nearing the Limit:**  We're getting very close to John's price.  We need to be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't meet us close to this offer. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message emphasizes fairness and value, aiming for a collaborative tone rather than an adversarial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has met John's price.  There's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice since we have a guaranteed option at the same price.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Pushing further might risk her walking away.
* **Successful Negotiation:** We've successfully negotiated Alice down from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, achieving a significant saving."
