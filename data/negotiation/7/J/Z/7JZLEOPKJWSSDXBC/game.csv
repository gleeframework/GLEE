"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
