Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm not comfortable with Bob's offer, it's still valuable to me.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is only $1,000 below my initial counteroffer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd like to avoid further negotiation."
