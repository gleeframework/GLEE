"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $725,000 to feel comfortable with the sale. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $710,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $715,000, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer in this range. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",715000.0,Alice,5,
