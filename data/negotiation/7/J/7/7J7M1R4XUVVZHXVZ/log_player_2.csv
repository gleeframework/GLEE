"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm selling it for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You can try to negotiate with Alice, but you have a guaranteed better price elsewhere."
