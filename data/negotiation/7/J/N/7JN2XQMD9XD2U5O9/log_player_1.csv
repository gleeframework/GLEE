{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider my offer by mentioning the product's value and potential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $2,000,000 is my starting point, I'm open to negotiation. This allows for flexibility in case Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Plan B:**  I'm always aware that I have a backup option with John, who will pay $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering my budget and what I've researched about the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product.
* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Plan B Still Available:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,200,000 is unfortunately far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising, but Not Giving In:** I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, showing willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reasoning for the Price:** I'm explaining my counteroffer by referencing the product's potential, emphasizing that it's a fair price.
* **Seeking a Solution:** I'm focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution, suggesting that we can reach a deal if we keep negotiating. 
* **Leverage Remains:** My fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 continues to provide leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value I've researched about the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  Since I'm comfortable with this price, there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a deal.
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out or delaying the process.
* **Plan B Becomes Irrelevant:** With Bob agreeing to my minimum price, selling to John is no longer necessary."
