"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you could meet me in the middle at $165. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",165.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $155, which is the lowest I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
