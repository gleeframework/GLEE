"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $100 is cheaper than buying from John for $120.
* **The price is within your budget:**  The price is $100, which is within your budget of $120. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this scenario to save money."
