Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Below Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $100 is still $20 less than its value to Bob, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Above John's Offer:** While you have a backup buyer, aiming higher than $80 maximizes your potential profit.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $100. He might try to negotiate a lower price. You'll need to decide your next move based on his response."
