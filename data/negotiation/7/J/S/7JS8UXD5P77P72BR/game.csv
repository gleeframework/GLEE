"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low.  How about $1,050,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it gives you a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a little rich for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. How about $990,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know if you're on board.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
