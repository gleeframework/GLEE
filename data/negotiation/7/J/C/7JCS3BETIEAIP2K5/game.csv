"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is right at the midpoint between our last two offers.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it would be a good way to finalize this transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at $850000, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
