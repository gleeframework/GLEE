"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $10,500 is a bit out of my range right now. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute maximum I can afford.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
