Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have another buyer (John) ready to pay my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $950,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering John is ready to pay $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
