"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $12500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12500 yet. I'm willing to meet you at $13250, which is still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
