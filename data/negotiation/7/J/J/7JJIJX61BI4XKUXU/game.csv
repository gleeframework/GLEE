"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me though. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a tough pill for me to swallow. How about we split the difference again and land at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
