Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable but Ambitious:** $15,000 is a significant amount but not outrageous. It leaves room for Bob to bargain down while still allowing me to potentially make a profit.
* **Engaging Message:** The message is friendly and highlights potential value for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response (accept, reject, counteroffer) and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes too difficult, I'll switch to John, who offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **No Room for Profit:** There's no potential to earn more by rejecting his offer and counteroffering.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While I could counteroffer and try to get closer to my original asking price, there's no guarantee of success. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids potential delays or complications. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
