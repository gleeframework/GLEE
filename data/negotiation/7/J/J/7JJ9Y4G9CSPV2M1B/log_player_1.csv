"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $10,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession - how about $12,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11800, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's final offer of $11,800 is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to accept a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value."
