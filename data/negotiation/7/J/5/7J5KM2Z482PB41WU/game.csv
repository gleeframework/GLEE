"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my commitment to working with you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
