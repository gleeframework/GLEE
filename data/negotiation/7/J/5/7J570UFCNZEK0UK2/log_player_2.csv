"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point of $100.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 90 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 87? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to give you a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  You are getting a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a few dollars off. There is no reason to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $100."
