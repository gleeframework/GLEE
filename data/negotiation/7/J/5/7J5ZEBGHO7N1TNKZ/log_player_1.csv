Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as this offer stands for a limited time."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000,  selling to Bob for a slightly lower price allows you to potentially earn more than the $8,000 he values it at.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as time-sensitive and giving Bob early access, you increase the perceived value and encourage a quicker decision. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still ensuring you remain above your minimum acceptable price."
