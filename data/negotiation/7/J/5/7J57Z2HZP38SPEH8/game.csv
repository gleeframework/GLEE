"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that.  However, my price reflects the true value of this product.  I can go as low as $975,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This offer stands for this round only; if we don't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",975000.0,Alice,5,
