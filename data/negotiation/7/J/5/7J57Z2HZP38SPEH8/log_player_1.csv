**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $965,000 offer.  He's consistently aimed for a price around $950,000-$960,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant sum compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
