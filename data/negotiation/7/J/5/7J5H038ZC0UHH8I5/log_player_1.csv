Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. If he accepts, I've maximized my profit. If he rejects, I can start lowering the price strategically.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's willingness to counter shows he's interested. I'll try to meet him halfway between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping to his price immediately, indicating the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for further discussion if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to go a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $125 is a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of losing Bob entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the sale."
