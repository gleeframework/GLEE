Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with an offer higher than your minimum selling price. This gives you room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Aiming High:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or unique.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees you at least $100. Therefore, any offer below that is not acceptable.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping in mind Bob's valuation and your guaranteed alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's interested and willing to pay a price higher than his perceived value. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By coming down from $140 to $120, we're showing Bob a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still comfortably above both Bob's valuation and John's offer, giving us some bargaining power. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $110 is a reasonable profit above our minimum ($100). 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, potentially prolonging the process unnecessarily. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely if we push further. Accepting now secures a good deal."
