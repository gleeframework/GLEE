I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $120 to him and at least $100 to me.  This gives Bob a good deal while also ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $120.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I believe $110 is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

Bob is not willing to budge much, and I'm now at the point where selling to John for $100 is the best option to ensure I don't lose out."
