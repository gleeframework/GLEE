Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have John as a backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before you sell it to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  A good strategy is to start just below Bob's maximum valuation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline, e.g., the end of the business day tomorrow], after which I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confident and emphasize the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Deadline:** Creates urgency and discourages Bob from delaying his decision.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is fluid. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Carefully consider any counter-offers he makes, keeping your minimum price and his potential valuation in mind."
