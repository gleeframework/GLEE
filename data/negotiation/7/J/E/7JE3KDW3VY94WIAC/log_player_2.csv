"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $10,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price. Alice is starting high knowing you have an alternative. By rejecting her offer, you incentivize her to offer a lower price closer to her $8,000 value."
