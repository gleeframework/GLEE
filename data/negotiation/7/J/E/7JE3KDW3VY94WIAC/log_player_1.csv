Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $10,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember that Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's no need to go below that price."
