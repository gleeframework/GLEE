{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer). 
* **Profit Maximization:** Aim for a price that gives you the most profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. 
* **The Offer:** $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you ($125,000 over your minimum) while still saving Bob $75,000 compared to his valuation.
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"":** This phrasing emphasizes the offer's seriousness and discourages Bob from countering with a lower price.

By starting high, you increase your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay."
