"Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $14000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,3,
