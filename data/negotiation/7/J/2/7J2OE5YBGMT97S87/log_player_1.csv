Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive and encouraging:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and preventing Bob from immediately walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a higher offer:** Even though Bob is currently offering my minimum, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more if I push back a little.  
* **Maintaining control:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation.  
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  By rejecting his offer, I can see how serious he is about buying the product. If he's truly interested, he may be willing to raise his offer.

I'll now counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still significantly less than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is positive and emphasizes a win-win scenario to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Further negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for more discussion if needed. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $13000, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it shows that Bob is willing to compromise.  

* **Good profit:**  I'm making a profit of $1,000 over my minimum, which is a good outcome considering the potential risk of continuing the negotiation.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate, putting me at risk of having to sell to John for $12,000.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and clean sale, which is desirable. 

It's a good time to close the deal and secure the profit."
