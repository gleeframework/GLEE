"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is getting closer to my goal, it's still a little lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to try and push for a bit more in the next round.  I think I can get him to pay $9,500, which is still a good deal for him considering the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,100 is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,100 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to push for just a bit more. I think there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get."
