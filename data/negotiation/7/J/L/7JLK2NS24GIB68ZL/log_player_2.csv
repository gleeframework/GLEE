"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this deal will be mutually beneficial. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
