Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to you. "",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering a price significantly lower would leave potential profit on the table.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it just above his valuation wouldn't be tempting enough. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, so I'm in a strong position. This allows me to be firm with Bob."
