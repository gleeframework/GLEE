"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of $950,000, which is a good compromise between our valuations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000 yet. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, which is still a bit above my minimum value, but I think it's a fair price given the value you're placing on the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
