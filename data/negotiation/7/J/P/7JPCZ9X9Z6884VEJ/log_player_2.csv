# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable.  I'm asking for $140 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80.  It's worthwhile to reject and see if she'll come down in price."
