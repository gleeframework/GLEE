,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $16,000. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value you'll receive. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This price would allow me to reach my target and still give you a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,6,
