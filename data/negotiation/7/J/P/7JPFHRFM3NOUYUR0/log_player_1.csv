Round 2

Round 4

I'm still not willing to sell for $14,000. It's very close to my minimum, but I'd prefer to see if we can get a little closer to $15,000. I'll counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm not comfortable with $13,500. I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreeable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
