"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,550,000 is not a good fit for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but that's my top offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference this time and settle on $1,400,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that $1,250,000 is my maximum offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
