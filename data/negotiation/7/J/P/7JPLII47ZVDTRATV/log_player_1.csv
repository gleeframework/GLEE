"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I want to maximize my profits, I also want to avoid an immediate rejection. By offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I create an opportunity for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product for both of us, setting the stage for a potential win-win scenario. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is mutually agreeable while keeping my ultimate goal of earning as much money as possible in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he is still interested in the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, I maintain the opportunity to reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while protecting my interests and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,550,000 is not a good fit for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but that's my top offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  We're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.  There's a good chance we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than $1,300,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference this time and settle on $1,400,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
