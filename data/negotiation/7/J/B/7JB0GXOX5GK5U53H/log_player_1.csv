Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price that is a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It also leaves room for potential counteroffers and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than selling to John, you still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer that might get you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to go down to $100 to make this deal happen.  Let me know if you're still interested at that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better than $100. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to John's offer of $80, it is still above your minimum price of $80. Accepting this offer ensures you make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price."
