"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
