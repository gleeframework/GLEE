This offer allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation, as it's below Bob's perceived value but still significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a better deal.  While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value we've both agreed this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would ensure a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,375,000. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer. It's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it."
