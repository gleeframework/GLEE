Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially exceed John's offer.
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to start significantly higher. However, we don't want to go too high and scare him off immediately.  
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being closer to our minimum acceptable price than Bob's perceived value. This gives us flexibility if Bob tries to negotiate down. 

This offer aims to find a win-win situation where Bob gets a price he might consider reasonable, and we potentially earn more than our guaranteed sale to John."
