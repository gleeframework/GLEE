"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90. How about $87.50? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and my last offer of $90.  Would you consider $88.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I really want to make this deal work.",88.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $88.75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $88.75. How about $88.13? It's a small adjustment, but it's still a fair price for both of us, and I really want to make this deal work.",88.13,Bob,6,
