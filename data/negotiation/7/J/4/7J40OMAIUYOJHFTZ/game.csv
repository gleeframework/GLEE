,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price, considering the value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's work together on this.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. However, I'd like to add a condition that if we can agree on this price, I'd also like to get a 1-year warranty on the product. Would you be willing to consider this?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your request for a warranty, and I'm willing to offer a 6-month warranty. It's a compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal at $9,250. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product and the warranty.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the 6-month warranty, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $8,000, and I'll throw in a 1-year warranty to make it a more attractive deal. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,6,
