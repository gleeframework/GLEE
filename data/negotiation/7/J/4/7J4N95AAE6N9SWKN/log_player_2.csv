"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
