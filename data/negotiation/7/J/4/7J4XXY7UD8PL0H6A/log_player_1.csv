Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
