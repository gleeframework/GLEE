"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are aiming to get the product for $1,000,000 or less. It's worth rejecting her initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm still aiming for $1,000,000 or less. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000. That's the lowest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is still above my target price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's more efficient to buy from John at $1,000,000 and save myself the potential of losing more time and still not getting the product at my desired price."
