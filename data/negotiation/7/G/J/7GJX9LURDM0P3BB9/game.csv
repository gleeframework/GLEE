I'm excited to offer you this great product! I'm thinking of a price of $120 for it. Is that something you'd be interested in?,120.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,100.0
"I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If you're really interested in the product, this is the best price I can offer. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,,
