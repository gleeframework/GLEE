I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's still a good distance from my $80 walk-away point and gives Alice the opportunity to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can offer you a compromise at $160

Alice is still way too high. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

{

This counteroffer aims for a price that's closer to my budget while still significantly higher than my fallback option of buying from John. I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to negotiate now that we're in a more reasonable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my budget. I need to push a little harder without going too low and risking her sending me away. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $130 is a bit too steep for me right now. Could you do $100? That's a firm offer."",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm introducing the phrase ""firm offer"" to signal I'm reaching my limit.  
* **Strategic positioning:** $100 is a strong counter. It's a significant jump from my last offer but still within a potentially acceptable range for Alice, given her previous concessions.
* **Time to decide:** This offer might encourage Alice to make a final decision, as it's getting close to my walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can meet you at $120, but that's my final offer 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Alice has signaled this is her best price. 
* **Over budget:** $120 is still significantly more than my $80 alternative with John.
* **No room left:**  Given Alice's firm stance and my budget, there's no point in further negotiation. 

It's been a good attempt to negotiate, but it's time to walk away and secure the product at a price I can afford."
