Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the minimum you're willing to accept â€“ $1,500,000 (since John will buy it at that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists if there's a price range where both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal. In this case, the ZOPA is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, you don't want to scare Bob off with a price too close to your reservation price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity and I know you'll see its value. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000, reflecting its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**
    *  Keeps the tone positive and highlights the product's value.
    *  Subtly anchors the price by mentioning ""true worth in the market,"" suggesting it might be valued higher elsewhere. 
* **The Price:**
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to potentially negotiate down.
    *  Provides a good starting point for discussions and keeps you well within a profitable range.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob counters, you'll need to weigh his offer against the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
