"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is the absolute highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $11,200 to break even. I can offer you a deal at $11,200, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
