"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should counter-offer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above his $10,000 budget. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so there's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is the absolute highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $11,200 to break even. I can offer you a deal at $11,200, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $11,200 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll come down to his desired price."
