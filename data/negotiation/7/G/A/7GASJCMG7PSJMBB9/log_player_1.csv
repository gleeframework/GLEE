Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our valuation and John's guaranteed offer.  We have room to negotiate.
