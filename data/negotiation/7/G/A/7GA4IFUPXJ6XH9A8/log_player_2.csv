"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value of this product is much higher.  Let me know if you're interested, I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can still do better. Since Alice is open to negotiation, Bob can reject her initial offer and try to get a lower price."
