Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance Bob will pay slightly more than his perceived value ($100). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also creates the impression of a price reduction from my guaranteed sale price.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints. If I had more information, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
