"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
