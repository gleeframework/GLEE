Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $80 is still a bit too high for me. Can you meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is very unlikely to go above $80. He's incrementally increasing his offers, and we've reached the point where accepting his offer would mean no profit. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable profit.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob."
