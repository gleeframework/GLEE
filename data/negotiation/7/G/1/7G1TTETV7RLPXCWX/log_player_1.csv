Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000.  This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I know I can get at least $10,000 from John if the deal falls through, so I'm not afraid to risk it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price from him or John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly lower than what I could get from John, and it's more than likely that Bob won't go higher. It's better to secure the sale now than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a deal altogether."
