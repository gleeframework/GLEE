"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential business relationship, I can't go as low as $105. How about $110? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair price that considers the product's value to me, and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I appreciate your offer,  $108 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is a fair price that allows for a successful deal for both of us.  What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
