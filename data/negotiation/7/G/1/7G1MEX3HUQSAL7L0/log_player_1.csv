"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's better to try to get a higher price than $105. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential business relationship, I can't go as low as $105. How about $110? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair price that considers the product's value to me, and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $110.  There's still time to negotiate and I don't want to settle for too low of a price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I appreciate your offer,  $108 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is a fair price that allows for a successful deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 109}
