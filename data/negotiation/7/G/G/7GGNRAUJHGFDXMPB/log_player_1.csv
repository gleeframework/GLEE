{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a slightly higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's still a good deal for Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate, while also ensuring I don't give away too much value immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $1,150,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 right now. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,180,000. This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to achieve a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1180000}
