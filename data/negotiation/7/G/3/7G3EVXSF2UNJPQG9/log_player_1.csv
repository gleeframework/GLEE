Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. It also anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits, even if his perceived value is currently lower than the offer. 
* **Exclusivity:** By mentioning a public listing, a subtle sense of urgency is created, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""fair deal"", ""your thoughts"") signaling your willingness to discuss the price further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know John will pay full price, understanding Bob's needs and constraints could lead to a faster, albeit slightly less profitable, sale.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to counter Bob's potential counter-offers. Having a clear bottom line ($1,200,000) will help you negotiate effectively."
