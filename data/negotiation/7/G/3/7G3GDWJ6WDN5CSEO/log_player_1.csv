Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $850000. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. $750,000 is too low."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the original price you mentioned was $800000. Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not confident I can push Bob further, so it's time to take the sure thing with John."
