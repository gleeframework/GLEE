Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I have a guaranteed offer from John.
