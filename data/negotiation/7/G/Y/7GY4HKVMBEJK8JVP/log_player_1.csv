Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is still lower than my minimum price.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
