"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $9,000 is my final offer.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so how about $8,875? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $8,950, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you want this product, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,950 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make it worth your while.",8800.0,Bob,8,
