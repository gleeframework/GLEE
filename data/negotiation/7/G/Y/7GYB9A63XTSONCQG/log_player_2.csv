# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal considering it's worth at least $120 to me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
