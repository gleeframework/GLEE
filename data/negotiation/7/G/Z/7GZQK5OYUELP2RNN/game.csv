"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,025,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way up to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,075,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
