"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if I can get her to come down further.  If I reject the offer, I can counteroffer again, and it might make Alice more motivated to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. It's also a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. This offer puts more pressure on Alice to accept, as she's likely to lose a lot more if she rejects this offer and I choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is only $800 above my maximum budget.  While I would prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings. It's likely Alice won't go lower, and I'm at risk of losing out on a good product.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
