"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $130 is less than Alice's value, it's significantly more than your $80 limit and what John is offering. You can get a much better deal by going with John."
