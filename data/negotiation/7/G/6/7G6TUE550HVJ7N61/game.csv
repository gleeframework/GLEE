"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to move down a bit, how about $2,000,000?  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1,850,000?  This offer is a good compromise and within my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
