,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. This product is closer to  $8,000 in my budget. Would you consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Do you think that could work?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a compromise. While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
