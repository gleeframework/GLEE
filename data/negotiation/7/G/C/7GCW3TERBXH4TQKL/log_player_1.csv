Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's truly unique and worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, and it's better to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer for now and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's a fair price considering its value. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $8000? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to buy it from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and it's better to sell to him than to John.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
