"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  It's a fair price that's closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
