I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer."
