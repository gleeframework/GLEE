Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,775,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits.

Bob is consistently countering, which suggests he's willing to pay a decent price. We're getting close to John's offer, but there's still room to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground: $1,800,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000

``` 

At this point, we're getting close to the halfway point between our initial offers, and Bob is still engaged. This price is a strong offer while still leaving room for a final counter from Bob that might be even more favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but within my budget, I can only consider a price of $1,750,000. I hope this proposal meets your needs and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly set on a price around $1,750,000. Accepting this offer secures a significantly higher price than John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
