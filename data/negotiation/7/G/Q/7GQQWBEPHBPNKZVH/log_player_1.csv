Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer as reflecting the product's ""true worth and potential"" subtly implies it might be worth even more than the asking price in the future, potentially making Bob more amenable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room to negotiate down towards $800,000 if Bob shows resistance.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any information you glean during negotiations."
