"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. Its value is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its unique benefits and potential.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Considering the true value of this product and its potential impact on your business, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price is still fair, reflecting the value you'll gain while allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go to ensure I can recover my initial investment. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
