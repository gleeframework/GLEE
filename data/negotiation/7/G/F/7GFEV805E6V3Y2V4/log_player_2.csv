"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to me and Alice is offering it for $100. It's a good deal, but I want to see if I can get it for a lower price. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd love to get it even lower, $97.50 is still a good deal for me. It's less than what John is offering, and it seems Alice is firm on her price. I'll accept the offer and save some money."
