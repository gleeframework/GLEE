We're getting close, but I want to push for a bit more. It's still worth holding out for a higher price from Bob."

It's time to accept.  Bob is clearly anchored around $86, and we're unlikely to get much more. Taking the $86 is better than risking John changing his mind, or Bob walking away in later rounds."
