"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is more than the product's worth to you ($10,000). 
* You can get the same product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is a better option."
