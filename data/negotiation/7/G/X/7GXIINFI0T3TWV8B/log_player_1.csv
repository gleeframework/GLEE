Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is very low. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $11,000? This is still a great value for you, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,800? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate further, but if we can't agree, I'm prepared to sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still unfortunately below my minimum.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price, and it allows me to make a profit while still providing you with a great deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $10,200? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is slightly above my minimum and I'm getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the sale. If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk reaching the end of the rounds and having to sell to John for $10,000."
