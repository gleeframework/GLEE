"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, reflecting a substantial discount.  This price still represents a significant gain for you, while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
