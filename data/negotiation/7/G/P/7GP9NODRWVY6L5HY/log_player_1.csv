"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price range of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, reflecting a substantial discount.  This price still represents a significant gain for you, while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,050,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. It's important to remember that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
