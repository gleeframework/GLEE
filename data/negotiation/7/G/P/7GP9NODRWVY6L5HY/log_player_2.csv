Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, reflecting a substantial discount.  This price still represents a significant gain for you, while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
