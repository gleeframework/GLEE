"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm not sure the product is worth $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $650000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $650000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $675000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $670000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further.",670000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $670000. I'm willing to meet you at $610000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",610000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $610000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $672500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",672500.0,Alice,9,
