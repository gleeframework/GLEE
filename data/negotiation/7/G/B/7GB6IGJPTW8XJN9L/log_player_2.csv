"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value to us, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity for you to acquire it at an introductory price of $7500. This offer is valid for the next 48 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if you can get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $7,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $6500 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our initial prices. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price of $6,000.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, $6,500 is a good deal considering John's price of $10,000.  Accepting now minimizes the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the negotiation dragging on."
