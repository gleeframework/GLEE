{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I've chosen to start with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of getting a good price while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. Accepting his offer will ensure I make a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
