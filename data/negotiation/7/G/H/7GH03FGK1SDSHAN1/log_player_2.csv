Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $15,000. This is a very fair offer for a product of this quality.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can get the product from John for $8,000. This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm slowly increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm serious about the purchase but still keeping it within my budget. I'm also trying to emphasize the value I see in the product to justify my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm motivated to sell, but need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $13,000 is still a bit high. I'm not desperate and I know I can get the product for less from John.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise by offering a price that's in between our last two offers.
* **Finality:** I'm stating that this is my final offer to create pressure and encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning other options (John) reinforces my bargaining position."
