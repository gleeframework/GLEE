"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500 right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $15,000. This is a very fair offer for a product of this quality.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm motivated to sell, but need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
