Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing me a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. I don't want to offer it to Bob for less than that. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a strategic opportunity for Bob."
