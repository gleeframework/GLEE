"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a final offer, and if you're serious about getting this product, let's make it happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250. How about $9,125?",9125.0,Bob,6,
