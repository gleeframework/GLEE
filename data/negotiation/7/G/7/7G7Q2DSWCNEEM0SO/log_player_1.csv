Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him and framing it as a great deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a final offer, and if you're serious about getting this product, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250. How about $9,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,125 is very close to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price, especially with John as a backup buyer. I'm confident this is a good outcome, as I'm still earning a decent profit."
