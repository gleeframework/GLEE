"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. Based on your feedback, we're prepared to consider a higher price than initially offered. We propose to sell the product to you for $950000. We believe this offers a fair compromise between our valuation and your budget.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. My final offer is $875000. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
