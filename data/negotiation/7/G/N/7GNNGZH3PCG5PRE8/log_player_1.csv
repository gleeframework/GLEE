Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a fantastic deal for an item you'll greatly benefit from."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 gives Bob the impression of a deal while still leaving a potential $500 negotiation buffer for Alice if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John at $10,000, so she can afford to aim high with Bob.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
