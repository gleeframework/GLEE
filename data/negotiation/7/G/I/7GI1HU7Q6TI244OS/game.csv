"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we both have a price in mind, Alice. How about we settle at $75? It's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go.",78.0,Bob,6,
