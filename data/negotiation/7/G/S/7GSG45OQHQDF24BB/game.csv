"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $820,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $820,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to consider $760,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to consider $790,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",790000.0,Alice,5,
