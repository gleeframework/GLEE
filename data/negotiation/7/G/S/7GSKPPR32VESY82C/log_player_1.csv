{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth exploring further with Bob, but selling to John is still the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
