Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, indicating flexibility.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. This gives me bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but  showing I'm willing to compromise by dropping my price from $9,500 to $9,000.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Openness to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, signaling that I'm still open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but not too far away, keeping my options open with John if the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,800?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only a $300 increase from his previous offer, which doesn't represent a significant enough change for me to accept.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John is a backup:**  Since I can sell to John for $10,000, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
