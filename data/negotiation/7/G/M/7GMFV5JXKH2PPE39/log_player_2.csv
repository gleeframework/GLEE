"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still too high for him. He can do better."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is understandable, the value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This is a considerable investment for you, but I believe the potential returns justify the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's lower than the previous offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He can likely negotiate further and get a better price."

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John and secure the product for his desired price."
