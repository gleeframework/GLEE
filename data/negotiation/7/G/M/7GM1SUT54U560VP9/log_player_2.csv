{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $155 is still a bit too high. I'm going to reject and counter again, hoping to get her down to my desired price point.  There are still a few rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going all-in with my final offer of $120. This is my absolute maximum and aligns with the price John is offering. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I believe there's a chance she'll accept.  If she rejects, I'll be happy to buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is still too high for me.  I've already reached my maximum budget and made my final offer.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $120.  This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids any further negotiations."
