Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind. 
* **Justification:**  While not giving specifics, vaguely mentioning the benefits for Bob could make him more amenable to the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your bottom line. If he's savvy and senses desperation, he might lowball you.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide if you want to go lower, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
