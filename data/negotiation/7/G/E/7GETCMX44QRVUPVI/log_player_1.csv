"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to take a little less than my initial asking price, but $110 is simply not enough. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $112 is better than $110, it's still too low for me.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  There's still a chance I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the point where I'm essentially at John's price, so I'm not willing to go any lower."
