Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer, so I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This counteroffer should signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $500 below my initial asking price and $500 above what I would get from John. While I'd love to get closer to my initial target, the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss.  It's better to secure this deal and avoid the possibility of a stalemate or Bob walking away."
