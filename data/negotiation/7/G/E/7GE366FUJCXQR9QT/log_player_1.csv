Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $12,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer that is still beneficial to me.
* **Plan B:** I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I may be able to get a better price in the next round.
* **No rush:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I have time to see if I can get a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll keep in mind that John is a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Final Agreement:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, giving him an incentive to negotiate further while still being closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and optimistic, aiming to keep the negotiation positive."
