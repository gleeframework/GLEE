"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1200000. It's a truly unique opportunity with immense potential value.  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, especially if the product isn't as unique or valuable as she claims."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer matches the price John is offering.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to purchase from her. Accepting her offer saves you the time and effort of further negotiations."
