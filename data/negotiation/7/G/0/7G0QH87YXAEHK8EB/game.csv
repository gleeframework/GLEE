"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
