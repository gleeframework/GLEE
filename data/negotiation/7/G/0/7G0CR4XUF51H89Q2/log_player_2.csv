"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at this price. Let's make a deal! How about we start at $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer shows Alice you're serious about getting a better price and encourages further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 70}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  We want to establish a lower price point, so $70 is a good starting point for our counteroffer. This shows we're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasoning:**  We offer a reason for our counteroffer:  We are willing to pay $70 and see if we can make it work. This keeps the conversation positive and focused on finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'd like to counter with a price of $72 for the product. This is my best offer, given its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $72 is within our acceptable range of $80 or less.
* **Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is close to our initial counteroffer.
* **Risk:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate or that the deal will fall through. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
