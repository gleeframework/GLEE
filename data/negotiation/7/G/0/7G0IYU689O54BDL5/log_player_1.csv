Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,200,000 (the least you'll accept).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $1,500,000 (what it's worth to him).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, knowing you have John as a backup. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Price:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your reservation price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA to allow room to move up.
* **Relationship Value:**  Is a long-term business relationship with Bob more valuable than a slightly higher profit in this one transaction? If so, a slightly less aggressive price might be strategic."
