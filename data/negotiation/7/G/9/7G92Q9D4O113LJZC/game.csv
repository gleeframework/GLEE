"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from this product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right fit for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
