Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly trying to push the price as high as possible, but her latest offer of $820,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further haggling risks pushing the deal away entirely. Accepting now secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
