"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to settle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $12,250 is close, but I need to get at least $12,500 out of this.  That's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
