Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message is intentionally a bit vague about the product's absolute value. This allows Bob to potentially anchor on the higher price if he's particularly interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and inviting, suggesting I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob hesitates. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on how much risk I'm willing to take and my assessment of Bob's personality (e.g., is he likely to negotiate aggressively?)."
