"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's serious interest in buying the product while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  Since Bob only has 10 rounds, there's not much room to let the negotiation drag on too long, but there's still a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price of $12,000.  A counteroffer of $11,500 shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for Alice to come down in price. This is also within the maximum Bob is willing to spend on the product."
