Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,"" you create a sense of urgency and highlight the product's worth, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, the message's tone implies a willingness to negotiate, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere closer to $130.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough to avoid Bob outright rejecting it and forcing you to sell to John at your minimum price."
