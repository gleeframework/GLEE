Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $950,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm, and while we could try to push further, we're running out of rounds.  Her offer of $1,012,500 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart and being forced to overpay with John."
