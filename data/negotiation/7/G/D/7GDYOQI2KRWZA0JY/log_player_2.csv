"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a significant discount, knowing Alice wants to sell the product.  Offering $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her. This leaves room for negotiation while pushing for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer but still leaves room for negotiation.  While Bob could accept and save $50,000 compared to buying from John, there's still a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to the price Alice wants to sell for.  Offering $1,000,000 is a good compromise and shows a willingness to meet in the middle. It's still below Bob's maximum budget and provides Alice with a profit on her valuation.  This counteroffer is likely to be accepted."
