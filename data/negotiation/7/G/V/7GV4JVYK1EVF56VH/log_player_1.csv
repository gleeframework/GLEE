Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,300,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $1,275,000?  That's a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1275000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000, but that's my final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is within my acceptable range and is a decent improvement over my previous offer.  It's worth closing the deal now, as continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely."
