"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential benefit. 
* **Openness:** I invite Bob to respond, encouraging further negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are still 8 rounds left. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price. 

I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially secure a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Openness to compromise:**  I'm willing to compromise but still hold firm to my desired range.

By showing a willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my price, I hope to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $11000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation space:**  We have 6 rounds left, and I believe there is still room for improvement in the offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher or potentially secure the full $15,000 from John.

By rejecting this offer, I'm aiming to get a better price and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $10,200 is still a little too low for me. Given the value of this product, I believe $10,500 is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($300) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize the value of the product and aim to present the price as a fair compromise.
* **Collaborative approach:** I reiterate a collaborative approach, suggesting that finding a mutually beneficial solution is the goal.

By staying firm but showing a willingness to compromise, I aim to encourage Bob to make a final offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time pressure:** We are now in round 6 with 4 rounds remaining.  The pressure is increasing to make a deal.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still hopeful that I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially secure the full $15,000 from John. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him. I'm also going to consider selling to John if a better offer doesn't come through."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,300, which is a compromise on my part. This is the best I can do, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm offering a small concession of $300, which is a sign of good faith and shows that I am willing to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, it's important to make a deal.  A small concession may be necessary to avoid missing out on a sale.
* **Final Offer:**  This is likely my last offer to Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John.
* **Direct Language:** My message is direct and clear. It conveys that this is the final offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as it's still a better price than John's offer, but it's also the lowest I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob has stalled. His latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a better price than any offer from Bob.
* **Risk of no deal:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate and no sale. 

It's time to secure a certain profit by selling to John. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer enough in the remaining rounds, and I risk missing out on a guaranteed $15,000."
