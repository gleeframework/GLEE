"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer of $900,000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,
