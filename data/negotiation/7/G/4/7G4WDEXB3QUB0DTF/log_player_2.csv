"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer of $900,000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
