Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 gives some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Greed:**  While you could try for more, there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you ending up with the $100 from John. This price point balances risk and potential reward."
