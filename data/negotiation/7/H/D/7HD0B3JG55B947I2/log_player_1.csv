"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I want.  I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush.  I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
