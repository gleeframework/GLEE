"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's value but allows room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer is high enough to give me some leverage, but still leaves room for a reasonable compromise. 
* **Knowing My Floor:** I'm aware of my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and am ready to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain my leverage. 
* **Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired outcome, but still allows for a potential agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to where we need to be."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $10,250 is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $11,500. It's also halfway between my ideal price ($11,500) and Bob's initial offer ($9,000).
* **Fairness and Negotiation:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing the benefit for both of us.
* **Keeping the Deal Alive:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By coming down to $10,250, I create a  more balanced negotiation position. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to make another adjustment, while keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is right at my minimum acceptable price. This is a good compromise and a fair outcome for both of us.
* **Commitment:**  Bob has expressed his serious commitment to buying the product at this price, indicating he's unlikely to offer more.
* **Time is a Factor:**  The deal is approaching the halfway point (5 rounds), and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John or pushing Bob away with further negotiation.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,000 is a solid result and secures a sale for me."
