"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see your point about meeting halfway. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise, giving us both a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
