"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a fair return for us, I propose a price of $875,000. This remains higher than your initial offer but is more in line with current market conditions and our cost structure. I hope this revised proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,3,
