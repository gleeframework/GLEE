{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is the best possible offer I can give Bob initially. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to him, while still maximizing my potential profit.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,000,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below the product's true value to Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to do so.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the value you'll gain from this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save a bit more money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$825,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my initial asking price and a fair deal for both of us. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiations and potentially losing out on the sale to Bob."
