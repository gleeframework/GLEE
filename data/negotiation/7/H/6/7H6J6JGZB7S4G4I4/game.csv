"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,000,000 to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the value you'll gain from this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save a bit more money on this purchase.",825000.0,Bob,4,
