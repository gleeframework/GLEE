"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I believe you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my value for it and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's closer to my budget and allows for some room for a final agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty on the product, which is a $1,000 value. This should bring the effective price down to $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
