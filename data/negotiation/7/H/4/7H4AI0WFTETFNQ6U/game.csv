"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Do you think we can make that work?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering we're getting close to the midpoint of our initial offers.",11000.0,Alice,7,
