"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering we're getting close to the midpoint of our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price point that makes sense for me. I've already got a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John, and continuing to haggle with Alice has a significant risk of ending up with a worse deal."
