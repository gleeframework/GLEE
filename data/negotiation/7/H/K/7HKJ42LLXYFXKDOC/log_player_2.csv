Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is the top of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $815,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. You save $15,000 by going with John."
