Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. What do you think?,9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8750. I can do $8800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
