"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this will be a profitable investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we discuss a price around $1425000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $1,500,000.  I have 7 more rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,435,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1435000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we discuss a price around $1427500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,427,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,427,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,427,500 is still a good price and represents a significant profit.  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers and I don't want to risk having to sell to John for only $1,000,000."
