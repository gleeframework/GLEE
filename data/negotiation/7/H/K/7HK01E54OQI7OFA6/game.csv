"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a little further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle one last time.",10500.0,Alice,5,
