"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155. That's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but $155 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $142.50?  ",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $142.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $146.25. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",146.25,Alice,5,
