"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique and in high demand. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
