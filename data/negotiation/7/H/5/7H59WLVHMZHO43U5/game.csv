I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value of the product while staying within my investment constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
