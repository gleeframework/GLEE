"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  I believe this price reflects a balanced compromise for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above your budget. You're better off continuing to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your $1,000,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I firmly believe in the value of this product, I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair deal that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, it seems like she's firm on that price. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000, as it guarantees you get the product within your budget.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price, and continuing to haggle risks losing the deal entirely."
