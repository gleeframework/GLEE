"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000.

"I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I believe the product is worth more than $1005000, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $1200000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
