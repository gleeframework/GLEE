"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a great deal to the right person. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for $950000. This is a significant discount from what I believe it's truly worth. What do you say?
