{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** By suggesting negotiation, you show you're flexible and willing to work with Bob. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that encourages a successful deal while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price point.  You're aiming for a higher profit.  There's potential for a better deal with Bob, so you'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your initial offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but you're not accepting his initial price.
* **It's below your initial offer:** This shows you're flexible and open to reaching an agreement.
* **It's a fair compromise:** Splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000, so how about we settle on $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your target.  You're aiming for a higher profit and believe there's still potential for a better deal. You'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again - how about $10,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's a compromise:** It's still below your initial offer, but shows you're flexible.
* **It's above Bob's offer:** You're not accepting his price but demonstrate you're willing to reach a compromise.
* **It's a final attempt:** By stating it's ""fair for both of us"" and suggesting finalization, you create pressure for Bob to accept."
