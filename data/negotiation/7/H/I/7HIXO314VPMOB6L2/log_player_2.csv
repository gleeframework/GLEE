Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a deal for $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're interested, it's a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a great price.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $11,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's in your best interest to do so and save the extra $1,000."
