"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so how about we try $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
