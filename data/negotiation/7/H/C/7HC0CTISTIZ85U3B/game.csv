"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit above your target. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your revised offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet at $122? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $122. Would you be willing to go down to $117?",117.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to go all the way down to $117. How about we meet at $119? It's still a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",119.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $119. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $117 and $119. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $118?",118.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $118. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. How about we meet at $121? It's still a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",121.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $121. I've reached my limit and I'm willing to walk away. I think the product is worth $100, and I'm willing to pay that much for it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for that price.",100.0,Bob,10,
