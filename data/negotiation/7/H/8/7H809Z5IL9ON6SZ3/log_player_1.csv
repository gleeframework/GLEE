"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's important to start with a high offer to maximize potential profits. 
* **Reasonable but Not Outrageous:** $2,000,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it's still within a range that a serious buyer might consider.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and conveys the value of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.** Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.**  There's still time to reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a guaranteed sale for $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob.** 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product and provides you with a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** My counteroffer is still higher than my minimum value but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests. 
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth $1700000, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1350000. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.** While it's closer than before, it's not a deal I'm willing to accept at this point.
* **I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.** There's still potential to get a better price, especially since he seems willing to compromise.
* **Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000.**  However, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price that's more in line with my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly lower counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness and compromise:** I want to maintain a positive tone and convey a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reinforcing the value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to  get a price closer to my desired range while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By showing willingness to compromise and emphasizing fairness, I hope to persuade him to come closer to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **John is a safe bet:** While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, John is a guaranteed sale for $1,500,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're down to 4 rounds. It's becoming riskier to keep negotiating with Bob, as I might run out of time and be forced to take John's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to push Bob closer to my target. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John to avoid risking a further decline in price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't cover the true value of this product. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer it to you for $1,550,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last offer, and I'm dropping the price just below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and framing the offer as a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by making a final offer. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept. However, if he rejects, I'll sell to John to secure my minimum value.  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** I'm not willing to accept a loss on this product.
* **Only two rounds remain:** With so little time left, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high. I might not get a better offer, and I could end up with a lower price than John's offer.
* **John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000:** This is the safest option to ensure I receive my minimum desired value for the product.

**Strategy:**

By choosing to sell to John, I'm eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth the potential risk of ending up with a lower price or running out of time."
