Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you're still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong first offer:**  You're showing you're confident in the product's value, but you're also open to negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I need to see if I can get closer to that value.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives you a great deal on a product you really like. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to find a balance here.  I'm reducing my price, but I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum.  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit out of my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $85 and $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is still significantly lower than my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's important to remember that every negotiation is a balance between getting the best possible price and closing the deal."
