"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but that's my absolute maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's target of $1,000,000 and still saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the chance of getting an even lower price, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
