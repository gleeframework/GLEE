"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
