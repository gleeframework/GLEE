{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,300,000 is a starting point that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes fairness and opens the door for a discussion. 
* **John as a backup:** This offer is still above John's offer, meaning I'm not desperate and can walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price.

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum Value:** My minimum acceptable value for this product is $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates some willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer provides a strong safety net. If negotiations with Bob break down, I can walk away with a guaranteed $1,500,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can explore potential counteroffers that might bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer and hopefully more appealing to you.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial compromise from my initial offer of $1,300,000, demonstrating flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:**  The message focuses on finding a solution that works for both, reiterating my willingness to negotiate and highlighting the value of the product.
* **John as a backup:** This offer is still above John's offer, ensuring I have a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward and maintaining my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price and below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum Value:**  My minimum acceptable value for this product is $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to my initial price but still too low. There's still potential for negotiation, but I need to be careful not to settle for too little.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a strong safety net.  If I don't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I can walk away with a guaranteed profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can explore potential counteroffers that might bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price, while still maintaining my desired profit margin."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price.

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes a fair compromise and reiterates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1025000. I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum Value:**  I'm committed to earning at least $1,500,000 from this product.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirement and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and energy. It's not clear if Bob is willing to reach my minimum price, and I don't want to waste more time on a deal that might not materialize.

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure a profit that meets my financial needs and saves me from potentially losing valuable time in negotiations."
