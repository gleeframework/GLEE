"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer and hopefully more appealing to you.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1025000. This represents a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the potential benefit it can bring you. Let's work together to find a mutually acceptable solution.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
