"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and straightforward. I want to pique Bob's interest without revealing my absolute minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still above my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let me know if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing flexibility.  This is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and reiterate my willingness to negotiate. I want Bob to feel like we're getting closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still hoping to get it for $10,000. Would you consider that? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is persistent, but his offer of $10,000 is still above my minimum of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of getting nothing from him."
