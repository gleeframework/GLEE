"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my original price. How about $1,000,000? This price would still allow you to acquire the product at a significant value while ensuring I can recoup a reasonable amount of my investment. Let's keep this conversation going.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, how about $975,000? This price would allow us to finalize this deal while still respecting each other's needs. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
