"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $78 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession and sell it to you for $81. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
