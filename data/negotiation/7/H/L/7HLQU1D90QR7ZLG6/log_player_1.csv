Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, Alice should aim to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 tempts Bob with a good deal (saving $500) while still earning Alice a significant profit. 
* **One-Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
