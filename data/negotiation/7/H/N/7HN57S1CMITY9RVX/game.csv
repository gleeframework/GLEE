"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",12250.0,Bob,4,
