"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justify the Price:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, providing a basis for the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and invites Bob's thoughts, signaling that you're willing to negotiate. 

By starting high but remaining open to negotiation, Alice establishes a strong position for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your valuation and your opening offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's important to demonstrate that you're serious about a price closer to your desired range. 

While selling to John is always an option, it's too early in the negotiation to give up on securing a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I can agree to. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,450,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant advantage."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** The message starts by acknowledging Bob's offer and recognizing his budget concerns. This helps maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  Alice reduces her price by $150,000, a significant drop that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, she's still holding firm well above both Bob's offer and her minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, reinforcing the justification for a higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By proposing a price ""in the middle,"" Alice encourages a collaborative approach to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting closer to a comfortable price. How about $1,200,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches the price John is willing to pay. While Alice might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob, there's no guarantee. Accepting this offer ensures Alice gets her minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation."
