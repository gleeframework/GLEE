,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to compromise.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $11200? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10800, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $11500? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth considering.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $11000. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm sorry, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000. Can you reconsider and meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,10,
