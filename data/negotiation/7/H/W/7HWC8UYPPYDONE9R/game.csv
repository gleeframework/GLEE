"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is my best and final offer below $10,000.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $9,150? This would allow us both to find some common ground.",9150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,150. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,800, so I can offer it to you for $9,650. This is my best and final compromise.",9650.0,Alice,7,
