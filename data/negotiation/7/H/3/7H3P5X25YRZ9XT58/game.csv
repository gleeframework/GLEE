"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $13500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $12000, which is a good sign! However, I was thinking we could meet at $14000. I'm willing to make a slight concession from my previous offer of $13500, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
