"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let's make a deal at $12000. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it's more than I'd get selling it elsewhere. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
