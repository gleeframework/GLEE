"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let's make a deal at $12000. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it's more than I'd get selling it elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
