Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob, and I can always sell to John if nothing works out."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement over his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I can always sell to John for my desired price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's another slight improvement, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping that with a few more counteroffers, we can reach an agreement. If not, I can always sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with this negotiation. I'm only going to make one more concession. My final offer is $1,325,000. This is a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price, and I only have two rounds left. It's better to guarantee a sale at my desired price than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
