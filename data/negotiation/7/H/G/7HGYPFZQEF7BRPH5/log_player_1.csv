Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering the same amount as your backup offer from John. There is no benefit to continuing the negotiation at this point as it's unlikely Bob will go higher and you risk him lowering his offer. Accepting his offer secures the known amount."
