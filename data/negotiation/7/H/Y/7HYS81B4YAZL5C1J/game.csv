"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
