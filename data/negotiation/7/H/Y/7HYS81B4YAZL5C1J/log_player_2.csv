"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $11,000.  This price is still lower than John's offer of $12,000, and it's within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer will allow Bob to purchase the product while saving money.  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice at this point."
