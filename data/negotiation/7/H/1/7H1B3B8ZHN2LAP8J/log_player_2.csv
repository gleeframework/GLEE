"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Alice walk away. Accepting this offer will save me $25,000 compared to buying from John."
