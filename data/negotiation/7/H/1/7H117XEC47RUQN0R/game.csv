"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,800 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9800.0,Bob,6,
