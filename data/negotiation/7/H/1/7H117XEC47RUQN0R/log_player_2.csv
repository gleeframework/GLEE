"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value and uniqueness, I believe it's worth $12,000. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. This still reflects its high value but allows for a more favorable deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000, Bob can still walk away if the price doesn't drop further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer of $10,200 for the product. This still maintains a fair value for the product while allowing for a more reasonable price for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  However, Bob is still close to his target price and has the option of buying from John for $10,000. Therefore, it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,800 for the product.

Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,950 is very close to Bob's target price, it's still slightly above his budget.  Given that John is offering the product for $10,000, Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There's still room for Alice to come down slightly, and Bob can walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't drop further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While your offer is getting closer, $9,950 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900, and I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. It's a great deal for both of us, and it avoids the need to go back and forth any further. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
