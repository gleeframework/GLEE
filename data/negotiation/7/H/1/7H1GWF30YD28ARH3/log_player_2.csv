"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  Given its value, I think a price of $11,000 would be fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $11,000.  Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target of $9,500. By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a price closer to your target and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
