Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  Given its value, I think a price of $11,000 would be fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?"", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,875.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is very close to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might result in a smaller profit or even a loss if negotiations fail. Accepting his offer of $9,875 secures a good profit.
