"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you today. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful discussion. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my own minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing my own valuation.
* **Open Communication:** Encouraging Bob's thoughts promotes dialogue and gives me insight into his negotiation strategy.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer and recognizing the product's value. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reframe:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and his attempt at compromise but reiterate that it's too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** While my counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial price, it's a smaller concession than Bob's, signaling I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to emphasize the product's inherent value to justify the high price.

This counteroffer aims to maintain a strong position while encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and the guaranteed offer from John. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with no better alternative than selling to John. 

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
