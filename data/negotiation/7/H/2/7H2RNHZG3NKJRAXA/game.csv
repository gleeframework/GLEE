"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9000, but that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8800, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final concession.",8800.0,Alice,5,
