Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $170. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price. 
* **Accounting for Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. By pricing it at $170, we aim to secure a profit while staying within a range Bob might consider reasonable.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, giving you the opportunity to meet in the middle or hold firm at a price still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
