"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what I would get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $100 floor. I'm not willing to accept that price yet. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a safety net:**  While John is a reliable buyer, I'm still optimistic about finding a better price with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a minimum price.
* **Positive and persuasive message:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a ""great deal"" for Bob and highlighting the value he'll get by accepting the offer. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation in terms of finding a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum of $100.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing interest and is willing to pay more than his initial offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a good backup:** While John is a reliable buyer, I'm still hopeful of finding a better deal with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is my final compromise, as it's only $5 below my minimum. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, considering Bob's budget and the value of the product.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer. By saying ""Let's close this deal!"", I'm subtly reminding him that this is my final offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and persuasive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Met my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for further negotiation:** While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a better price from Bob. He's already at his budget limit.
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting his offer ensures I get a sale and don't risk losing the deal completely. 
* **John as a backup:**  While I could sell to John for the same price, I've already invested time and effort in negotiating with Bob. It's more efficient to finalize the deal with him."
