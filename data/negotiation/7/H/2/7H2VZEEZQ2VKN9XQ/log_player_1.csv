Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

This offer is slightly above your minimum price of $8,000, but leaves some room for negotiation. It also offers Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $10,000. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximizing potential gain:** This price allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum, while still being competitive.
* **Keeping Bob interested:** This price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but not so low that he feels like he's getting a steal. 
* **Protecting your minimum:** You're still guaranteed $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the price based on Bob's reaction and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
