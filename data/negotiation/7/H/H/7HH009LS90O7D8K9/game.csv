"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $750,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",800000.0,Alice,5,
