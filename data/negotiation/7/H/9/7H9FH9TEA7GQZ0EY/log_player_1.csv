``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, giving you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  It's also important to acknowledge that the price is based on your assessment of the product's value,  leaving room for Bob to argue his own perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and it gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering both our perspectives. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than what you're aiming for. You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob again.  There's a chance that he might be willing to budge a bit more, especially since you've already shown a willingness to compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000.  I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
