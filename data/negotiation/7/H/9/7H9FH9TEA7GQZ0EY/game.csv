,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1400000.  This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and it gives us both some room to compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering both our perspectives. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1000000.  I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
