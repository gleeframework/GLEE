{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $170 is far above my maximum budget of $80. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $80. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above my maximum budget of $80. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already used up 5 rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $80, which is within my budget and a better deal than what I'm likely to get from Alice."
