{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a tempting offer for Bob. It's significantly less than Alice's minimum acceptable price but still provides a $1,500 profit margin for her.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly saves Alice the time and potential hassle of going through another sale with John. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between securing a quick and profitable sale with Bob while keeping the price high enough to maximize Alice's earnings."
