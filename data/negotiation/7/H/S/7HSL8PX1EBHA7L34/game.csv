"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. If you're interested, let's schedule a meeting to discuss further.
