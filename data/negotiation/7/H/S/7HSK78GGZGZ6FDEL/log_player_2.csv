"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but closer to my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get the best price possible.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate further from this starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a price closer to my target. I'm hoping to get the price down to $850,000 or even lower, before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway and hopefully demonstrate my seriousness in reaching a deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice than her previous price, but I'm prepared to go further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. I'm hoping to get it down to $900,000 or even lower, but if we can't reach a deal, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $910,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. I believe this is a good compromise and could lead to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's only slightly lower than Alice's last offer, but still within my budget. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to drop my price to $920,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.  Let's seal the deal and move forward.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my budget and I'm running out of rounds.  Given that we haven't managed to close the deal yet, it's better to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from either Alice or John."
