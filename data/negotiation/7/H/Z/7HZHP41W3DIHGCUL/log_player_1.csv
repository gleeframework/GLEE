Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum price:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting your initial offer.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not so high that it seems unreasonable or that Bob will immediately reject it. 

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to $15,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than selling to John, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
