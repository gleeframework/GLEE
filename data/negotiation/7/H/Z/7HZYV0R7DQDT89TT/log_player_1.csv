Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is more than your minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **It's a strong opening position:**  By starting high, you demonstrate confidence in the product's value and leave room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below the potential value of the product for Bob ($1,500,000). Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to reach a price closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise from your previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:** $1,350,000 is still above your minimum desired price of $1,200,000, so it's a financially beneficial outcome for you.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for further negotiation, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's close to your previous counteroffer of $1,350,000, and it's significantly higher than selling to John for $1,200,000. 

While further negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether by continuing to reject offers outweighs the potential benefit of a few extra thousand dollars."
