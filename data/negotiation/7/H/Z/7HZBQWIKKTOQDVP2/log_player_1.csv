Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I know Bob values it at $10,000, but this gives me some room to negotiate if he's willing to pay more. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,500.  This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's still less than my ideal price, it's close enough to justify selling to him. It's more than his initial offer and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. There's always a risk of getting nothing if I reject this and try for more, especially with John waiting in the wings."
