{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is significant. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable value. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. I really think we can meet in the middle here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It's also a good deal for Bob, considering the value he places on the product.  I'm going to accept this offer and move on."
