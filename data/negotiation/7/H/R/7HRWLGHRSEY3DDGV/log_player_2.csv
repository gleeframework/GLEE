"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring further negotiations to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, as there are still rounds remaining.  He's already shown his willingness to pay closer to $8,000, so there's room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is your top budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account the value of the product to you and my own needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk of further negotiation taking too long or resulting in a price Bob isn't comfortable with. Given the time constraint of 10 rounds and the availability of John's offer at $8,000, it's the most financially sensible choice for Bob to purchase the product from John at this point."
