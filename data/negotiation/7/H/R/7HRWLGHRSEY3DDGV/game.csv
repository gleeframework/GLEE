"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is your top budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account the value of the product to you and my own needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
