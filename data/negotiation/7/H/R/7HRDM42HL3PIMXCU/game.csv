"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $900000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $825000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $737500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get what we need out of this deal.",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $737500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $737500 and $825000, which is $781250. What do you think?",781250.0,Alice,5,
