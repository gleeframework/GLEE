Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $800,000, making it appealing. 
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly high, keeping the door open for negotiation.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob negotiates down a little, any price above $1,500,000 is a win for you."
