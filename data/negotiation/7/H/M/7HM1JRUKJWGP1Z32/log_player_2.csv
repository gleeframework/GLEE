"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first, as her offer is quite high considering the product's worth to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000), I'm aiming to understand Alice's lower bound and leave room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. I acknowledge Alice's initial offer while firmly stating my position. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me in a good position to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $9,000.  It's a fair offer considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice reduced her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and leaves little room for me to save. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to nudge her closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $8,000, I'm aiming for a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($9,000) and my previous counteroffer ($7,000). This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help reach a quicker agreement.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of this price point.
* **Targeting Her Value:**  $8,000 is Alice's known value for the product. While she'd likely prefer a higher price, there's a good chance she'll accept this offer to avoid losing the sale."
