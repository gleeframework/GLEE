"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  To be fair, could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $14,000,  which is a good midpoint between our two offers.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,
