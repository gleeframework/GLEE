Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both of you exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for some negotiation but maximizing your potential gain. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value.""
* **High Anchor:** The price of $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA. While it's negotiable, it gives you a good starting point.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the price (""significant return on investment""), making it seem less arbitrary.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might soften your approach.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price slightly to secure a deal with Bob, as long as you stay above your $1,500,000 minimum."
