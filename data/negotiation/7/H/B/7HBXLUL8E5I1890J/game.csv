"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $100? I'm serious about getting this product, and that's the absolute highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
