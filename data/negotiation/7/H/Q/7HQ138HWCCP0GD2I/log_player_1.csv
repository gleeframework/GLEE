Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit, but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **It's clear and concise:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can use the information from his counteroffer to adjust your own, or you can choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $125 is a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though, and would be happy to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below your minimum price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can send Bob a counteroffer closer to your desired price, perhaps $115, to see if he's willing to budge.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting shows you're not desperate and willing to wait for a better offer.
* **Explore John's option:**  You can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a great deal on a fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not give away your entire margin.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reasoned justification:**  The message provides a rationale for the price, making it less likely for Bob to simply reject without further negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can decide whether to offer a lower price, sell to John, or end negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $110.  Let's make this deal happen!  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $110.  This is still above your minimum price of $150, and it's clear that Bob is serious about buying the product.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale.  While selling to John would result in a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit."
