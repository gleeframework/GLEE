"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some money, but $9500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer you the product for $10250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm afraid $10250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value it brings. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer you the product for $10000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
