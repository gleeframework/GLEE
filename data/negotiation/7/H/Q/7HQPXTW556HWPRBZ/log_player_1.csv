"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a reasonable starting point given the product's worth to Bob. I want to maximize my profit, but also want to keep the negotiation open and avoid losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $125. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $110. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept and avoid having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I want to avoid losing Bob and risk having to sell to John for less. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
