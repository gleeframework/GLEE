"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This signals a strong desire to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $12,000 is still within Alice's acceptable range (as the product is worth $10,000 to her), making this a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Clear Message:**  The message is clear and polite, establishing a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a great value for you considering the product is worth $15000. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still $1,000 difference. Bob wants to push further for a lower price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob can likely secure a better price than $13,000. The negotiation is still early, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John for $15,000 is a safe option, Bob could get the product for a lower price by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $12,000. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500? It's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob proposes a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith and demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is concise and clearly states the desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and friendly tone, reinforcing a collaborative negotiation approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12750. This is a great deal for you, and it's also a fair price for me. Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:**  Alice's offer of $12,750 represents a substantial saving of $2,250 compared to buying from John.
* **Close to Target:** The price is very close to Bob's desired $12,000. 
* **Risk of Escalation:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price or a stalemate, risking losing the deal altogether.  It's generally advantageous to accept a good offer rather than pushing for a slightly better deal.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice increases, making this a good time to accept."
