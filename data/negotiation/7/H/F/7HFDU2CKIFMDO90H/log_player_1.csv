Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get him higher, especially with 6 rounds left. I'm willing to hold firm for now."

We're getting close to the wire, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,800,000. I'll push back firmly one more time and see if Bob is willing to budge."

It's risky to push Bob further, and $1,775,000 is a respectable price. It's better to take this deal than risk him walking away and getting only $1,500,000 from John."
