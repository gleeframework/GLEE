"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point given Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This makes him more likely to consider my offer.

**Important Notes:**

* I'm keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $80, as I can always sell to John for that amount.
* I'm aware of the 10-round limit, but I'm starting strong to see if I can get a favorable deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a better deal in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, perhaps $95, and reiterate the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $90 is a bit too low for me considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Encouraging Closure:** I'm using persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept my offer and close the deal.

**Important Considerations:**

*  I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range.
*  I'm aware of the time limit and the option to sell to John, but I'm confident that I can close a deal with Bob at a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $120. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $92 is very close to my desired price range, and only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer of $95.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential price drops.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already in Round 4, and I need to be mindful of the 10-round limit. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a significantly lower profit.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to close the deal at a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $92 provides a good profit and reduces the risk of further negotiations."
