"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you can get the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your limit, while potentially leaving room to negotiate with Alice if you wanted to try."
