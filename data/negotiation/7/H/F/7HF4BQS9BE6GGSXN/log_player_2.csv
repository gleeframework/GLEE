"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John for $8,000. Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to purchase the product at your desired price point."
