"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John. Accepting this offer would save Bob a substantial amount of money ($1,000,000). There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose out on this deal, especially since the product's value to Alice is unknown."
