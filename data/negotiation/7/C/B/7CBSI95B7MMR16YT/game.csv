,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10800. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
