``` 
The offer from Bob is $8,750. This is above your minimum of $8,000. While it is not the highest price, it's likely that Bob won't go any higher. You could potentially continue negotiating but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and the risk of losing the sale to Bob increases with each rejected offer.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
