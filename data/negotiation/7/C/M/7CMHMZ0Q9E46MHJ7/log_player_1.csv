Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  A starting price of $1,200,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will provide valuable information for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob accepts your initial offer or negotiates down to a price still above $800,000, you maximize your profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust your price to reach an agreement.  Remember, any price above $800,000 is a win for you in this scenario."
