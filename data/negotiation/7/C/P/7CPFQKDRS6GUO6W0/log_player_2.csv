{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,800. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is a good price, and it's closer to your desired price range.

Accepting her offer now guarantees a good deal and avoids potential complications."
