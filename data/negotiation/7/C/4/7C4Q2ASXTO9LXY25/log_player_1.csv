Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also reflects the value I place on the product.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a new offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we might be stuck in a cycle of counteroffers. To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
