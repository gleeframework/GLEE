Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has a good incentive to accept the deal.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal without risking losing Bob completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $980,000 is very close to my desired value. I'm confident that continuing the negotiation with Bob might not get me a significantly better price.  I'm also aware that selling to John would result in a lower profit.  It's better to secure a good deal with Bob now."
