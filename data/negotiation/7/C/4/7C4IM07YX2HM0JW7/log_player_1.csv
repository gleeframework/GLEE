"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good midpoint between my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the benefit to Bob, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $100 provides space for potential counteroffers while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum:**  $90 is only $10 below my desired minimum.
* **Time is valuable:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Selling to John for $80 would be a loss compared to accepting Bob's offer.  

It's better to secure a decent profit ($10) now than risk a lower price or wasting time with further negotiations."
