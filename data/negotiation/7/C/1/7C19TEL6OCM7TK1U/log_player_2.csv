"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $850,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

``` 

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to our budget, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to get the price as close to $800,000 as possible, and John's offer ensures we don't overpay."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's split the difference. How about $750,000? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, we are also getting close to John's price.  There's no harm in seeing if Alice will come down a little more, getting us a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this offer saves us $62,500 compared to John's price. It's a good deal!"
