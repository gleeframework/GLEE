{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a bit more from Bob."

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  $725,000 is closer, but I think I can get him to go a bit higher.  I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer."
