"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows I am willing to negotiate but I won't accept a price that's too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'd rather continue to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of lowering my price gradually, but staying above my minimum. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but still want to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm confident that we can reach a deal that's more mutually beneficial.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's value for the product and my own minimum.  We're nearing the halfway point, so I'm hoping this will be a good offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what I need, and I'm confident I can get my minimum from John. It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee my desired profit."
