{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation, while still being attractive to Bob given the product is worth $15,000 to him. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob. It encourages a response and opens the door for further negotiation.

By starting with this offer, I am maximizing my chances of getting a good price while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then adjust based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful to get a better deal. Since I'm aiming to maximize my profits, I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll use my counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $13,250. This is the midpoint between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and reaffirms Bob's interest while explaining my rationale for the counteroffer. It highlights the value for both of us and emphasizes the fair profit I'd be making. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to bridge the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position."

# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair profit, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider this price?

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking a deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit, which is crucial for my business."
