"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at $12,000, you are not getting any discount.  It's better to reject the offer and buy it from John for the same price."
