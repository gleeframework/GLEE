"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.  Even if she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000, saving you $50,000."
