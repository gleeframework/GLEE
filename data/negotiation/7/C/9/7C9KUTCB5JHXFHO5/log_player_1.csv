Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists, but it's small. Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, and you won't accept less than $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob's perceived value is lower than your minimum, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor & Hope:** Start with a high price above Bob's value. This might work if Bob is poorly informed about the market or desperate. There's a risk he'll walk away, but you have John as a backup. 

2. **Direct to John:** Since you know Bob won't match John's offer, you could skip the negotiation and sell directly to John. This guarantees your minimum price.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Risky but Potentially More Rewarding)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and market demand, I'm offering it at $1,650,000. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Anchor:** The price is significantly above Bob's value, creating a sense of high value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message implies limited time and competition, putting subtle pressure on Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a softer approach might be better, even if it means going directly to John.
* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, this approach might backfire.

**The Safest Option:**  Go directly to John and secure your $1,500,000."
