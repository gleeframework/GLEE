"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500, which would be $8,000. Can you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
