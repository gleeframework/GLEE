"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle again at $120?  This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
