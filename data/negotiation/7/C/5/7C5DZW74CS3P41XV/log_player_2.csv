"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's still worth seeing if I can get it lower. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since I have the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my serious interest in buying the product but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is the same price as what John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John at $8,000 is the best option at this point."
