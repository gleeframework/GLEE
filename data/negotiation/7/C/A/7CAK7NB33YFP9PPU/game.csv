"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $500000 is a bit outside of my budget.

"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $900000. This reflects a compromise that acknowledges the value you see in the product while also allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
