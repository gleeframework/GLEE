"Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $16,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise!",16500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,500. How about we aim for $15,250?",15250.0,Bob,4,,
