Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I could start at $100, offering $95 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  This price point is significantly higher than my fallback option (selling to John for $80), ensuring a good profit."
