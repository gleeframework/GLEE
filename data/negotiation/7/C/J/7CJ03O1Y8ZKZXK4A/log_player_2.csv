"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll find to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be significantly more expensive.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you money while still getting you the product."
