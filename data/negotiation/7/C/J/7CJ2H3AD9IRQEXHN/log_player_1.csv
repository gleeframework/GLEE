"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  Since he values the product at $8,000,  he might be willing to negotiate up to a certain point.  If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount, and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's willingness to pay $9,500 and my own valuation. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already made a compromise.  Given that I'm running out of rounds and John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. It's a guaranteed deal and meets my needs."
