Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $19,000 is still above my maximum. Let's try $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for sticking with me.  I'm motivated to sell, but need to land on a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to do $18,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to get this deal done."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my budget, and  I'm willing to offer $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $18,000, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting his offer of $16,500 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away.  It's a good compromise at this stage."
