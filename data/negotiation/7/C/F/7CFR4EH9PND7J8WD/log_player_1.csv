"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I believe Bob will be motivated to buy, as the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still above my minimum of $100 but shows I'm willing to compromise. I believe Bob will be motivated to accept this offer as it is only slightly above his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is my absolute minimum, but it's also the value of the product to Bob.  I think this might be a sweet spot where we can finally close the deal."
