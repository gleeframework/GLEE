Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck at a price point far above your budget. She went up from $14,000 to $16,000, indicating she's not very flexible.  You have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000, which is significantly lower than what Alice is willing to offer.  It's better to take the sure deal with John at this point."
