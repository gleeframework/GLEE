"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional worth to you, valued at $1,500,000, I am extending an exclusive offer to acquire it from us at a strategic price. My proposal is to offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This price not only ensures a substantial return for us but also provides you with a significant discount compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for both parties. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further with you.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
