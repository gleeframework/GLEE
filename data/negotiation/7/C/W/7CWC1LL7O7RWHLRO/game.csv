"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute limit.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. Considering the product's value and my initial investment, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1025000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
