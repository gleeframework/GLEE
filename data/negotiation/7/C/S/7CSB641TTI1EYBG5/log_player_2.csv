"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's below market value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is below market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. While Alice is moving closer to his target, $11,000 is still outside of his budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  Let's split the difference this time and see if we can finally close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is within Bob's budget of $10,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer, potentially pushing the price back up, or the negotiations might drag on.  

Accepting the offer at $10,750 secures the product for a price that's slightly above his ideal but still acceptable, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
