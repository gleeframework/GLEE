"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  He's offering $10,000, which is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also has a firm budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as he's still closer to his goal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise.  $14,000 is still a good deal for him, and it might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still has a budget he needs to stick to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  $17,000 is still above his budget, and it's not clear if he can get Alice to go lower.  John offers a guaranteed price that's within Bob's budget, so it's the safest and most financially responsible option at this point."
