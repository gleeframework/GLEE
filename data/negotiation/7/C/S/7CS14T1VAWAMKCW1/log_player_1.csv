"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective, $12,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with him or find a better deal with another buyer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I want to make sure I'm not selling myself short."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  While $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'd rather sell the product to John for $15,000 and avoid further negotiation."
