,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could consider a price of $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too steep for my budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $7,500? I'm eager to make a deal if we can find the right price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
