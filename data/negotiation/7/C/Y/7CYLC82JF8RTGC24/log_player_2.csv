Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price for me.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that I might end up having to buy from John for a higher price. It's time to secure the deal at a price that is still within my budget and saves me a significant amount of money."
