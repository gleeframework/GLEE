"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $14000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13250? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a good compromise for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
