Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's valuable and justifies the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, and the question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

By starting at $20,000, Alice gives herself a chance to:

1. **Secure a higher profit:**  Bob might accept the $20,000, netting Alice a $5,000 profit over her minimum.
2. **Negotiate down:**  If Bob rejects the $20,000, Alice can gradually lower the price, knowing her fallback is John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
