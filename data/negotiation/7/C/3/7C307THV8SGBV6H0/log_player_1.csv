"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a good offer, I am aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we settle on $9,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to pay $9,600 for the product. This is the most I can afford without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and $9,600 is a good offer that's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I think it's best to accept this offer to avoid risking getting a lower price."
