"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the gesture, I still believe the product should be within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at a price closer to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000. I've already compromised a lot by offering you $9500 earlier. I think this price is a fair middle ground, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. If you're willing to meet me at $9000, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
