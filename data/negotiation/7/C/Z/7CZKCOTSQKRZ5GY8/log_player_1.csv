Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still higher than my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
