"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $110. Let's try to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you. You are willing to pay up to $120, and John is selling for $120. It's better to take Alice's offer and save $10."
