"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160, and that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $160 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $155?  I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can see that $155 is a bit closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $165, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again!",165.0,Alice,5,
