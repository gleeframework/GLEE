Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies there's competition and high demand, potentially justifying the price to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process. This increases the chances of a sale above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during negotiations if Bob pushes back, but always ensure you don't go below your $10,000 minimum."
