Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $112? That's a good price for both of us and will help us close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $112.  You've been consistently moving closer to your goal, but it's time to cut your losses. Buying from John for $100 guarantees you stay within your budget."
