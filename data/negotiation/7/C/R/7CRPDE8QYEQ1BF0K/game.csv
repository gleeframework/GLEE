"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I understand it's a valuable product to you, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $950,000?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer, showing my commitment to finding common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However,  $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $937,500?  It's a fair compromise that keeps us both moving forward.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point about splitting the difference, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $925,000. How about we meet at $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $920,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a bit more to make this deal work. How about $925,000?  It's just a small increase, and I think it's a fair compromise, showing our shared desire to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. That's as high as I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,8,
