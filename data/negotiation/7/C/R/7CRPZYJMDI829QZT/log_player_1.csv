Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,000,000 sets a high initial expectation and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, which encourages Bob to engage in a back-and-forth process.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle at $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer at $900,000 would be a decent profit. 
* **Potential for more:** However,  Bob has shown interest and has a potential budget of $900,000. By rejecting his offer, I can  try to secure a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale, the potential to earn more with Bob outweighs the risk of failing to reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. I'll use the following criteria:

* **Negotiation range:** My counteroffer will be somewhere between Bob's $900,000 and my $1,000,000. 
* **Concessions:** I'll make a small concession, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain momentum:** The counteroffer will emphasize my commitment to reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects its true value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between Bob's offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While conceding, I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Focus on agreement:** The message reinforces my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he rejects my offer, I'll decide whether to make a further counteroffer, accept his counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Time:**  The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $925,000 is a significant profit. While I could try to squeeze out a little more, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to reject his offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for a lower price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is higher than my floor.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation process is complete. I'll move forward with the transaction and finalize the sale of the product to Bob for $925,000."
