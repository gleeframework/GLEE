"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to close a deal, $900,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a reasonable price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,075,000? I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $1,075,000.  It's a bit closer but still falls short of my minimum. I'm going to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Let's try to reach a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $1,075,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and I'm running out of time.  It's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
