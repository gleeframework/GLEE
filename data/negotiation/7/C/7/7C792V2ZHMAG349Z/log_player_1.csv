"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This allows for room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm aiming higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise but still maintaining a profit margin higher than the guaranteed $800,000 from John. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement over his initial offer and closer to my desired price point. Given that we're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk further negotiation, I'll accept his offer. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
