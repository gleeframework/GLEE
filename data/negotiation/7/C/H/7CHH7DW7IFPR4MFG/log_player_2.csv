Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,625,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,625,000 is still above my maximum budget, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of running out of time and not getting a better deal. John is offering the product at my maximum budget, so it's the most secure option at this point."
