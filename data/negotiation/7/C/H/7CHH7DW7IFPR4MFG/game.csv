"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,625,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
