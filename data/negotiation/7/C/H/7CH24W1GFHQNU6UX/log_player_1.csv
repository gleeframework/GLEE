"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $90.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, and we can close the deal. If he still refuses, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we are getting closer to the halfway point of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with another price that is closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counteroffering with $82.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's current offer, and we're getting close to the middle ground. If Bob still rejects, I'll need to strongly consider selling to John, as we're nearing the halfway point in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're approaching the halfway point of negotiations, and I'm running out of time. If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk him getting frustrated and walking away entirely.  It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'm going to sell to John for $80.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a decent price, and I'm guaranteed a sale."
