"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I've had a lot of interest in, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not a steal.**  It's below your $150 limit, but you want to see if you can get a better deal. 
* **Exploring further is worth the risk.** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely tempting, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $100? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Fairness appeal:** Emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both sides can make Alice more receptive to your offer. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for potential back-and-forth, as there's a $20 gap between your offer and Alice's original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've had to invest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:** It's a compromise that splits the difference between her original offer and your counteroffer. 
* **It's a good deal for you:**  $110 is within your budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:** You've already had two rounds of negotiation, and continuing might risk Alice getting frustrated or walking away.  

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking losing it entirely."
