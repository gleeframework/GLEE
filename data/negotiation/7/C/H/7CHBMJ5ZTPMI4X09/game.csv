"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely tempting, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $100? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've had to invest in it.",110.0,Alice,3,
