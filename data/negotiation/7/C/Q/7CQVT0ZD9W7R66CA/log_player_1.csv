"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's strategic to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer significantly above your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential helps justify the high price and positions it as a premium opportunity.
* **Leaving Room:**  While aiming high, the offer isn't outrageously high (considering it's double your minimum). It leaves space for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value for the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. It's clear there's room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering, you can try to move the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true market value and the return I'm seeking. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique qualities and the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still aiming high, you've made a significant concession from your initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Reiterating Value:** By mentioning ""true market value"" and ""unique qualities,"" you reinforce the product's worth and justify the high price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to move closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap a bit more. How about $700,000?  That's a significant investment on my part and recognizes the value this product brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $700,000 is still below John's offer. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards, and we're not in a rush. Let's see if we can push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is closer, but I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. Let's settle this right now: $900,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer conveys a sense of urgency and firmness while still offering a price above your fallback option (John's offer).
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $900,000 represents a significant move from your previous offer and splits the difference between your last two prices. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise for a quick resolution.
* **Simplified Choice:** By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation further."
