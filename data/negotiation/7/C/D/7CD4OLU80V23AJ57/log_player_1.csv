Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I still have 9 rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price with more negotiation. I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's below my initial goal.  I'll try to meet him halfway again in the next round, but I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my initial goal, we're getting close to an agreement.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  $1,325,000 is a good outcome, and it's important to be flexible in negotiations."
