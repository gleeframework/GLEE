Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $790,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since the product is worth the full $800,000 to him.  I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $790,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will provide a substantial return on your investment.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $810,000. I hope this helps us move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and it ensures a sale.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob could back out completely, or we could reach an impasse.  Selling to John is a guaranteed $800,000, but I'm still hoping to get a little more.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible move at this point."
