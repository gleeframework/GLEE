"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000. This is my maximum budget and reflects the value I see in this product. I'm hoping we can find common ground. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value.  While I understand your perspective, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. As I mentioned before, I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, but I'm not going to go any higher.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping you'll reconsider and accept this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try a different approach. If you can share some of the specific ways you see this product benefiting you, it might help me understand your valuation and potentially adjust my offer accordingly. How about we focus on the value this product brings rather than just a fixed price?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to discuss the value proposition, but my budget remains fixed at $800,000.  I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but exceeding my budget isn't feasible. I'm sticking to my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
