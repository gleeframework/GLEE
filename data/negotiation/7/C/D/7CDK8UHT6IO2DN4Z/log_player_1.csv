Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000. This is my maximum budget and reflects the value I see in this product. I'm hoping we can find common ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value.  While I understand your perspective, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. As I mentioned before, I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, but I'm not going to go any higher.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping you'll reconsider and accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000, which is far too low. However, there's still a substantial gap to John's offer. It's worth seeing if Bob will budge at all before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try a different approach. If you can share some of the specific ways you see this product benefiting you, it might help me understand your valuation and potentially adjust my offer accordingly. How about we focus on the value this product brings rather than just a fixed price?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Strategy:**  Continuing to simply counter with lower numbers isn't working. This offer tries to open a dialogue about the product's *value to Bob* rather than just haggling over price. 
* **Significant Drop:** The price drop to $1,600,000 is substantial, signaling a willingness to negotiate but still staying well above Bob's current offer.
* **Information Gathering:** Asking Bob to elaborate on the product's benefits to him could provide insights into his thinking and potential wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to discuss the value proposition, but my budget remains fixed at $800,000.  I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but exceeding my budget isn't feasible. I'm sticking to my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Unwavering:**  Despite attempts to find a compromise and understand his perspective, Bob is firmly entrenched at $800,000. This suggests he's unlikely to budge significantly.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of missing out on John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Time is Valuable:** With only a few rounds left, the potential gain from continuing with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of selling to John."
