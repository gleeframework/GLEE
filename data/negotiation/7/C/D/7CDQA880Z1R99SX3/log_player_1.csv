Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm not asking for my full minimum value of $10,000 right away. This allows for negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* I'll see if Bob accepts. If he doesn't, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $10,000. 
* If I continue negotiating, I'll try to gradually decrease my price to a point where Bob is willing to accept, but still above my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, there's still a chance to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll try to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a great price for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm decreasing my price from the previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Still above minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. 
* If he still rejects, I'll evaluate my options: 
    *  Make another counteroffer, potentially decreasing my price a bit more.
    *  Consider selling to John, as the risk of further negotiations getting me a better price is diminishing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  $8,250 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to even lower offers, and there's no guarantee he'll eventually accept a price that's good for me.

**Strategy:**

* I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiations don't outweigh the risk of getting a lower price.
* Selling to John for $10,000 is the most sensible option, as it guarantees me my minimum and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
