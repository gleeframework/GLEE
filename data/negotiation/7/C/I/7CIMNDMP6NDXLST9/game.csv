"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that price is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",12000.0,Alice,5,
