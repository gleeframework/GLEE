"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price.  There's no reason to accept an offer that's significantly higher than his alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this works for you.

```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and although it's closer to his target, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  He can get the product for a guaranteed lower price from John. There's no need to gamble on Alice possibly coming down further."
