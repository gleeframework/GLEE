"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,250,000? This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
