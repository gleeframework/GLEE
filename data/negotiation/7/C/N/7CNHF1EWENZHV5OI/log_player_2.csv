"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a valuable piece and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and John is selling the product for that exact amount, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You can get the same product from John at the same price."
