"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer is far too high.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, accepting this offer would be a significant loss.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
