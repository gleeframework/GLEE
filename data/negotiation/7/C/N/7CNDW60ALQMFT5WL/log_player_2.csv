Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we need to find something mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. Would $800,000 work for you? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move from your previous offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a new price of $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $800,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll move much further. Accepting the $812,500 offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
