"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be open to something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find something mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. Would $800,000 work for you? That's the best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move from your previous offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a new price of $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,
