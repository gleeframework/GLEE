"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point. Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process and try to get a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I understand the product is valuable to you, but this is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. This is a fair compromise, let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high. I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is a sincere offer, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 to make this work.  This is a good compromise for both of us - you get a great product, and I get a fair price.  Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I believe I can push for a lower price. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Alice, especially since I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. I'm feeling more optimistic about reaching an agreement.  However, I'm still limited by my budget and can only offer $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering your need to sell and the product's value to me.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and it's a good compromise for us both.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to try and get a better price. I'm only $75,000 away from my ideal price of $1,100,000, and I believe I can bridge that gap with a strong counteroffer.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target.  Plus, I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.  This is a very fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me and your need to sell. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
