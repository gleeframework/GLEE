"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I understand the product is valuable to you, but this is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. This is a fair compromise, let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is a sincere offer, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 to make this work.  This is a good compromise for both of us - you get a great product, and I get a fair price.  Let's seal the deal!",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. I'm feeling more optimistic about reaching an agreement.  However, I'm still limited by my budget and can only offer $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering your need to sell and the product's value to me.  Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and it's a good compromise for us both.  Let's make this happen!",1175000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.  This is a very fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me and your need to sell. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close the deal!",1125000.0,Bob,8,
