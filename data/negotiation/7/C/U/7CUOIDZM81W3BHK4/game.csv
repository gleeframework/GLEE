"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
