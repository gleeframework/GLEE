"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
