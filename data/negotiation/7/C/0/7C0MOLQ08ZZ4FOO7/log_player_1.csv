Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product at $10000. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,500 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8500.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

This is a good deal. I'm getting $500 more than what I would get from John, and it's within my minimum price."
