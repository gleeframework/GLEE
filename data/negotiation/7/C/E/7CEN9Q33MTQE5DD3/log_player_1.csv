Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $90.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, and it shows that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $80? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no point in further negotiation, as I can't get a better price from Bob, and selling to John would give me the same amount."
