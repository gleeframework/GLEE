Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $80 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $90. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.

I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. $82.50 is closer to my limit, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
