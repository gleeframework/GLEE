Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, it's best to start with a high offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price closer to her minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will inform Alice's next move.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. This knowledge gives her leverage in negotiations with Bob. She can afford to be more assertive in her pricing. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate or walk away knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
