"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $935000. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,
