"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This reflects its true value while hopefully still being workable for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
