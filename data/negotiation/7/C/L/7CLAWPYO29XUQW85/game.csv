"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000.  I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  Would you consider $875,000?  This is a fair price, as it's closer to my budget and allows you to still make a good profit on the sale.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000.
