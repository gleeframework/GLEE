"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to let it go for $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $175. Would you be interested?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we settle on $160? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and compromised on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $165. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",165.0,Alice,5,
