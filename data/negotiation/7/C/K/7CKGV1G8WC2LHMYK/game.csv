"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without needing to go through more rounds.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $10,000. This product is truly valuable, and $10,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. We've both made compromises, and this price is a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal now. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
