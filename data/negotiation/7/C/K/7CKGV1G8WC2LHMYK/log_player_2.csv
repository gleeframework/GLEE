"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without needing to go through more rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $10,000. This product is truly valuable, and $10,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. We've both made compromises, and this price is a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal now.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}

It seems like Alice is unwilling to budge below $10,000.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. You'll save $2,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in further negotiations."
