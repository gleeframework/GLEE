"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1500000 is a starting point, it's significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still reflects the product's unique benefits and potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
