"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is its worth to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13,500? It's a fair compromise and lets us both get closer to our desired price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
