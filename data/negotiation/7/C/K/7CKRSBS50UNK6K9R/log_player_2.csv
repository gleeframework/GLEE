**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's beneficial to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discounted price, I'm looking to get closer to $850,000.  This would allow me to secure the product while still maintaining a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to offer a compromise. We propose a price of $875000 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while providing you with a competitive advantage in your market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a reasonable compromise, bringing the price closer to my target of $850,000. It's a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to sell at a lower price, or that I'll end up paying more than $875,000. Accepting her offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
