Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the ""special price"" framing might make him reconsider. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential for higher profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
