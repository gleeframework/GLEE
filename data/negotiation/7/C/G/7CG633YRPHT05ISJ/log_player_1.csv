{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows for potential negotiation while still giving you a good profit margin. Remember, you can always lower the price if Bob rejects the offer, or sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob.  There's room for negotiation to get a higher price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to your desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This allows for a fair price for both of us, and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  The potential of a drawn-out negotiation with Bob isn't worth the additional $500."
