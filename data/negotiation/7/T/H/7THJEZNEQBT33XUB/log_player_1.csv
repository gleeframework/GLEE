Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price she's happy with. 
* **Strong Call to Action:**  The message is framed positively and encourages Bob to accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $11,000. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she's not losing anything by aiming high initially."
