"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
