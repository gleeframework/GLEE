Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** You've shown you're serious about selling, but you're not giving away the whole profit margin. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your goal than John's offer, it's still worth trying to squeeze out a bit more. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a good chance you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'd love to accept your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to exceed my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting closer to your minimum of $8,000. While you'd prefer more, Bob has shown he's not likely to budge much further. Accepting his offer at $9,200 is a safe bet, guaranteeing you a good profit."
