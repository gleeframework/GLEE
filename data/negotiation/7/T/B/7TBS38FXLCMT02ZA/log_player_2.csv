Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more fair given the product's potential value.  Let's compromise at $1350000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's unique features and its potential for growth. What do you say?
