"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and has the potential to be extremely valuable for you.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more fair given the product's potential value.  Let's compromise at $1350000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's unique features and its potential for growth. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1200000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
