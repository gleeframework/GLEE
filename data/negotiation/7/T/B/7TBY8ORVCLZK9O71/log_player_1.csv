Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than what I had in mind. This product holds value for me, but not at that price point. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the $700,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a deal that works for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite far apart on price. To be honest, at this point, $1,900,000 is still not feasible for me. If you're able to offer something closer to $1,000,000, I'd be happy to continue this conversation. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm disappointed with this latest offer.  Frankly, I have another offer on the table for $800,000. To be transparent, that's much closer to what I'm willing to pay. If you can get closer to that number, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and revealed his backup offer is $800,000. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I still believe we can negotiate a better deal than his backup, especially with five rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for being upfront.  I value your honesty and I want to make this work.  Let's settle this right now: $1,350,000. That's a significant compromise on my end, and a fair deal considering the true value of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show flexibility but firm resolve:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's alternative while sending a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith, but not at the cost of a significant loss.
* **Strong but fair compromise:**  $1,350,000 is a middle ground that represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and a significant profit above Bob's revealed alternative. 
* **Call to action:**  By proposing this price as a ""let's settle this now"" offer, I'm adding a sense of urgency and opportunity for Bob to close the deal on favorable terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I need you to meet me closer to my limit. This is my final offer - $1,200,000. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other offer. I do believe this product would be mutually beneficial, so I hope we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now escalated his offer to $1,200,000, which is significantly closer to my asking price and a substantial profit over his revealed alternative of $800,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While he may have some room left to negotiate, it's very likely this is indeed as high as he's willing to go. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further could make Bob walk away entirely, forcing me to sell to John for $1,500,000. Accepting his offer secures a $1,200,000 sale, which is a significant return and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
