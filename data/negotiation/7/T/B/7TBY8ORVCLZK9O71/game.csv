"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than what I had in mind. This product holds value for me, but not at that price point. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the $700,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite far apart on price. To be honest, at this point, $1,900,000 is still not feasible for me. If you're able to offer something closer to $1,000,000, I'd be happy to continue this conversation. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the investment and potential of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm disappointed with this latest offer.  Frankly, I have another offer on the table for $800,000. To be transparent, that's much closer to what I'm willing to pay. If you can get closer to that number, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with the other offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for being upfront.  I value your honesty and I want to make this work.  Let's settle this right now: $1,350,000. That's a significant compromise on my end, and a fair deal considering the true value of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I need you to meet me closer to my limit. This is my final offer - $1,200,000. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately need to go with the other offer. I do believe this product would be mutually beneficial, so I hope we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
