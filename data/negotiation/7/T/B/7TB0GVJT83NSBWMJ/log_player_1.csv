Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value, especially with the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds before considering selling to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is getting close to my desired value.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned I won't get a better offer and risk losing out on a sale entirely.  It's time to accept and move on."
