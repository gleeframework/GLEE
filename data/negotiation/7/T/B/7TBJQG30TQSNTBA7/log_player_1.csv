{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also friendly and inviting, which can help to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is a good price,  it's still lower than what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go to $125?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $125, $122.50 is a decent compromise and still a significant profit. It's important to keep in mind that Bob might walk away if I reject his offer again, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $100."
