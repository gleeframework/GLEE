"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a profit.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while keeping the price higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get more,  accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids further negotiation. There's always a chance that Bob will reject further counteroffers and I might lose out on the sale."
