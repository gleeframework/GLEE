"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $11,000 is less than his maximum, there's room for negotiation to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is still a good deal for Bob, it's still higher than his ideal price point.  He can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm ready to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has reached a point where he needs to decide if the potential savings of further negotiation are worth the risk.  Alice has stated her bottom line, and continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate or even Alice backing out of the deal completely.  

*  $11,500 is a decent price for Bob, and it's still lower than his maximum budget of $12,000. 
*  Buying from John at $12,000 would be less favorable. 
*  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, potentially leading to a loss of the deal.

It's a good strategy to accept Alice's offer to ensure a deal is reached."
