"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great price, considering it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than buying from John ($150), it's still significantly above Alice's valuation of $80. There's a good chance you could get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will come down."
