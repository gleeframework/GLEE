"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price is fair, given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This considers the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  At this point, I'll purchase the product from John for $10,000 and avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice."
