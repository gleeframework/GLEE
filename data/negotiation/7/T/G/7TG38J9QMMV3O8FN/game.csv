"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product.  However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. Let's work towards a deal!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value to me and allows you to make a significant profit.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
