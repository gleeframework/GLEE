"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $7,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to be a bit more appealing. How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still too low for me. To be honest, I'm starting to think this deal might not work out.  If we can't find a price that works for both of us, I'll have to move on to another buyer who's willing to pay what this product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's our last chance to make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,7,
