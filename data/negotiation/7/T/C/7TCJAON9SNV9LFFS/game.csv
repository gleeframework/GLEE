"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you want a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and we could both be happy with the outcome.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
