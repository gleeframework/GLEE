# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and worth every penny. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $15000 for it. This offer includes not only the product itself but also exclusive access to our VIP support for a year. I believe this deal presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000 for the product. The product is worth $10,000 to me, and I don't think it's worth the extra $5,000 for the VIP support. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.
