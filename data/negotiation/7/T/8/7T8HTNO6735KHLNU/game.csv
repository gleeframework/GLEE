"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair given its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to $950,000 to proceed. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a higher price, but $950,000 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $900,000. This represents a fair compromise that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's try to close the deal on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $900,000 is still a bit low.  I'm proposing we settle on $925,000. This gives us both a fair profit while closing the deal. Let's finalize this. ",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $910,000, which is a fair compromise and ensures we both make a good deal. Let's finalize this agreement.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this deal work. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $915,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward. ",915000.0,Alice,7,
