"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your budget, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $775000, Bob, but I'm still not ready to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
