"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10200.0,Bob,4,
