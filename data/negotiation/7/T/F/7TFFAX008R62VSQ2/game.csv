"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
