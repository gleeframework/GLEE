"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $70 is more than Bob's stated value of the product, it's lower than my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for $80.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I don't want to settle too low so early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $75 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle again at $77.50? I'm trying to be flexible here."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob keeps pushing the price lower, and I'm getting concerned about reaching a satisfactory agreement. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $80."
