"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $9000? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9500?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit, while still keeping the deal attractive for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,
