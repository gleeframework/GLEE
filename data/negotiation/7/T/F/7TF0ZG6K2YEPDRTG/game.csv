,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired outcome. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting a compromise on my end.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I can afford. Let's try $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're willing to compromise, we can close this deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
