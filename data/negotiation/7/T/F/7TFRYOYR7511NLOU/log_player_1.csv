Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Attractive Offer:** $1,100,000 is still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I'm open to discussion, making it less likely for Bob to immediately reject the offer. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't settle for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still secure a higher price. I have a backup offer from John, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive in the negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  I believe the value of this product warrants that price, and it's still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm not budging too far from my initial offer. I'm reminding Bob of the initial value proposition.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I show I'm open to compromise by suggesting finding a ""mutually beneficial solution.""
* **John as Leverage:** I'm not desperate, having John as a backup option."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's final offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.  
* **Maximizing Profit:** By selling to John, I ensure I receive the highest possible price for my product and meet my minimum value requirement."
