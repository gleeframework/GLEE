"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal and worth more than that, but I'm willing to start the negotiations high.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal. Let's meet in the middle.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you think it's worth more, but I'm really only able to go up to $95.  If we can meet at that price, I'm ready to buy. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still leaves me with very little profit.  Let's try $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $100, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,6,
