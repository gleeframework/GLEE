"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",12500.0,Alice,3,
