"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, given its unique value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $14000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9500 is still far from what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $12000 is my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
