Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves space for potential counter-offers.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it's close enough to be tempting if he truly needs the product."
