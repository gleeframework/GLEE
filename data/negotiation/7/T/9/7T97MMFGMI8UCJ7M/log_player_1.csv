Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than $90.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you, considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $100 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired price. There's always a chance Bob will counteroffer again, but I'm willing to take the risk."
