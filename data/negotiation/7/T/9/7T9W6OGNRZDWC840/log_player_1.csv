{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  It's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:**  It's lower than your minimum acceptable price, giving you flexibility to counter if he rejects. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 

By setting a high initial price, you're maximizing your potential profit while still leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  

You can use your knowledge of John's offer as a leverage point in future negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** This price is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Emphasize fairness:** The message frames the offer as a compromise and highlights the product's value.
* **Positive tone:** It keeps the negotiation open and encouraging. 

This counteroffer strategically balances your need for a higher price with your desire to continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiation we've had so far. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your ideal outcome. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,200,000, so it's worth holding out for a better deal from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell at a lower price.
* **Potentially secure a higher offer:** By continuing to negotiate, you might be able to get Bob closer to your target price.

You can use John's offer as a bargaining chip in your next counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to acquire the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the product's value and the progress we've made in our discussion.  Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show compromise:**  By lowering your price from $1,000,000 to $1,050,000, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  The price is still higher than Bob's offer, giving you leverage.
* **Highlight value and progress:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth and the positive negotiation so far.

This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency for Bob, suggesting that this might be your final concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation we've had so far. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You've already demonstrated a willingness to compromise, but Bob's counteroffers suggest he's unlikely to come closer to your target. 

Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,200,000, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure your minimum profit.  There's no need to risk further negotiations with Bob, who might not reach your target price."
