"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a very competitive price. I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's $8,000 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I see we're close. Let's compromise. I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to get the product at a great value, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This would be a win-win for both of us.  We're getting closer to an agreement, and this price is a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is willing to come down to $10,500, Bob has now reached a critical point in the negotiation. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting Alice to lower her price further are slim. Bob has already gone as high as he's willing to go with his counteroffers, and Alice has consistently refused to drop below $10,500. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures that he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice.  

While there's always a chance that further negotiations could lead to a lower price from Alice, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no product at all."
