Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."

Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a little more, $9,000 is a good compromise and brings me closer to my goal.  It's also significantly better than selling to John."
