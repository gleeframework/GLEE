"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get it for less. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so you have time to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. You've already negotiated the price down from $120 to $110, and you only have 7 rounds left. While you might be able to get a lower price, the risk of the negotiation falling apart and you having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it.  $110 is a good price for you and allows you to save $40 compared to buying from John."
