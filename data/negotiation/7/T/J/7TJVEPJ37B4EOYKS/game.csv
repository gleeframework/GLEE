"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to achieve. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value the product holds for you while still allowing me to reach a reasonable selling point. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
