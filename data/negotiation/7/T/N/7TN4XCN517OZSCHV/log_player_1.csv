Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer you could send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving him a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your reservation value.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming closer to $1,200,000 is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and desirability.
* **Confidence:** Emphasize your confidence in the product's value.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you a significant profit margin while still offering Bob a good deal (saving him $50,000 from his perceived value).

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure he's happy with the deal.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start with a higher price (closer to $1,200,000) and be prepared to negotiate down."
