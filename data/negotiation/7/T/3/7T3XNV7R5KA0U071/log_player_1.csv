Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a higher price ($150) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value leaves space for potential counter-offers or a compromise that still earns you a profit above your minimum."
