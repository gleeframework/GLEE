Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer sets a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also less than Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, making it a potentially attractive starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations. I'll counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It signals my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still a good price considering it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a quick and profitable sale."
