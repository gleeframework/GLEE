"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I know you'll recognize its immense worth.  How about we start at $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and might even reveal if Bob values the product even higher than we anticipate. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""valuable product"" and ""immense worth"" subtly reinforce the product's high value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""How about we start at,"" it signals that this is just an opening offer, and we're open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's very interested and willing to pay a premium. I'm confident we can push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we both agree this product has significant value.  To make this work, I'd need to see something closer to $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** Recognizing Bob's counteroffer keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Highlight Shared Value:**  Reiterating that the product is valuable to both parties reinforces its worth.
* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price by $100,000, showing willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong position above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and is moving closer to our range. While $1,250,000 is tempting, we still have ample rounds to see if we can close the gap further. The risk of losing him as a buyer by countering is relatively low at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Build Rapport:**  Acknowledging Bob's seriousness aims to establish trust and a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Direct and Solution-Oriented:** We're moving towards a more direct proposal of a compromise (""find a middle ground""). 
* **Smaller Concession:**  The decrease in our counteroffer is smaller this time ($75,000), indicating we're getting closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $1,275,000 is a strong profit, representing a 27.5% increase over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more,  prolonged negotiations can become unproductive. Bob is clearly invested, but there's a risk he might disengage if we push too hard.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we receive the payment sooner, allowing us to reinvest or utilize the funds more quickly."
