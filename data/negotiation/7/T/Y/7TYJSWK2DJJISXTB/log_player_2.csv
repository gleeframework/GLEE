You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, there's potential to get it even lower.  I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially a good deal for her. I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my target, I'm still not at the price I'm hoping for. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm still trying to get the price down. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get it even lower, $82 is a fair price, and I'm starting to run out of time. I'm willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
