"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $100?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering it for $110.
* **This is a good deal.** It saves you $40 compared to buying from John.
* **There's a chance of further negotiation, but it's not guaranteed.** You might be able to get a better price, but there's also a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending the negotiation. Accepting this offer guarantees you get the product at a good price."
