Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,100,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""potential value"" and ""benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of his high valuation without explicitly stating it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing a starting price"" signals that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while maintaining a collaborative and respectful tone with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest closer to $900,000. Would that price point be feasible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value. Bob's offer suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desired investment range.  Considering the unique value this product brings, I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of its worth. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've significantly reduced my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price point.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  By stating ""allows us both to benefit,"" I'm emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome and encouraging Bob to meet me closer to my price. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still pushing for a price that exceeds my minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $950,000. While this is still below my ideal price, it's a significant profit margin above my minimum of $800,000. Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
