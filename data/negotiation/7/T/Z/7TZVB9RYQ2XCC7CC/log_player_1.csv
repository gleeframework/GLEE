Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $9,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we can make a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome without further negotiation."
