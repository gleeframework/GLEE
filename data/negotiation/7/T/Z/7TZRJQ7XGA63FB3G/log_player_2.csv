"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I want to be fair and see if we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is closer to your offer and also reflects the value I'm placing on this product.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and ending up with nothing. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is your maximum budget. It's better to secure the product at your target price than to gamble on getting a slightly better deal."
