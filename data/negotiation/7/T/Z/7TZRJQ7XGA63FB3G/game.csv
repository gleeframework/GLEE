"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I want to be fair and see if we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is closer to your offer and also reflects the value I'm placing on this product.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,5,
