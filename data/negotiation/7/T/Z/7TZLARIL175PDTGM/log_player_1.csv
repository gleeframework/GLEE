I'm starting with an offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. If he rejects, I'm guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not losing out on anything."
