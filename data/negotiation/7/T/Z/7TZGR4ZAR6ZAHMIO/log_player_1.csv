"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm looking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 yet.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is tempting, I'm hoping we can split the difference.  Would you be willing to pay $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground by offering $115, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""split the difference""), making it seem more logical.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive tone (""tempting,"" ""hoping"") to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $112 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer more,  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
