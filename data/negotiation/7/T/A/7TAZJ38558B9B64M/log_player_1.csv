Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, I believe the product is worth more than $1,250,000, especially considering his initial valuation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's keep this negotiation going and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my minimum price, $1,200,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where I'm concerned I won't be able to get a price closer to my desired amount. Bob's offers are getting too low, and with only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking the sale entirely. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than potentially getting nothing if I continue negotiating with Bob."
