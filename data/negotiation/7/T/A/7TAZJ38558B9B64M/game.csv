"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's keep this negotiation going and see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
