"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider a price of $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
