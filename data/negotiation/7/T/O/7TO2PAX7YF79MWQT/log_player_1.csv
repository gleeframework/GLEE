Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value. I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'll counter with something closer to my initial offer, but I need to consider that if we go back and forth too much, I risk losing out to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to give it away. I need to balance my desire to get a good price with the risk of losing Bob altogether and being forced to sell to John for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to sell it to Bob for a higher price, I'm concerned that if we keep going back and forth, we'll reach a stalemate and I'll be forced to sell to John for even less. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, which is at least my minimum acceptable price."
