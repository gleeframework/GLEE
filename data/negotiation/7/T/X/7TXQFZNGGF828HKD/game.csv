"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000?  That way, we both get a good deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, so how about $975000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be extremely valuable. Let's finalize this deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. How about $950000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Time is running out, so let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. Can you consider that price?",920000.0,Bob,8,
