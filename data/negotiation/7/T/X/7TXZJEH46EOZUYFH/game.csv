"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is still a great value considering the benefits it can bring to your life, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've already compromised on. I hope this is something you can work with.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10800 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",9000.0,Bob,6,
