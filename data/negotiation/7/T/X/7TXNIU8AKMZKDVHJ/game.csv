"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a perfect fit for your needs. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's start with $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $1,200,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  The value this product brings to your business is significant.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  This price is fair to both of us and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
