"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,250,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the negotiations with a fair price, and I'm open to discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This still offers you a substantial gain over the product's value to you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950,000. This is the best I can do at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This offer is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the maximum I can go without going over my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
