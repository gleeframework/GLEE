Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
