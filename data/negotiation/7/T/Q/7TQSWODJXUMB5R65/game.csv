"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'll meet you at $16,750, and that's my final offer.",16750.0,Alice,5,
