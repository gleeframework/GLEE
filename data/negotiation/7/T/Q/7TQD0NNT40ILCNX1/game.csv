"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this work!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
