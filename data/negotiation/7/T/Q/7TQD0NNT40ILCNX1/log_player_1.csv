{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is high for you. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. I'm also being positive and encouraging to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I also have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm not willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to counter again, I'm concerned that we're reaching an impasse. John is a guaranteed buyer for a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more certain deal."
