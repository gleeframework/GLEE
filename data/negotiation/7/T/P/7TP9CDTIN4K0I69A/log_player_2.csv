"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There is room to negotiate a lower price, as Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000.
* **Avoiding risk:** Buying from John is a guaranteed option, but it's the most expensive.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This recognizes the product's true value while still giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Alice has already come down from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Avoiding the guaranteed price:** Buying from John is expensive, and there's still a chance you can get a better deal with Alice.

**Strategy:**  You'll likely need to make a few more counteroffers to get to a price you're comfortable with.  The goal is to find a balance between maximizing your savings and not risking losing the deal entirely."
