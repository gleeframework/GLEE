"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This recognizes the product's true value while still giving you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, closer to your last offer but still within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
