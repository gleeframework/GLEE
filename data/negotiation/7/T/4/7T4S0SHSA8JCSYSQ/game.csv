"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my needs. In light of our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
