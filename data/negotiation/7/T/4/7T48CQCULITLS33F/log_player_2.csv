"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** It's within your budget and only slightly higher than your last counteroffer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but it also carries the risk that Alice will reject your offer and you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take additional time and effort, and this offer is a good compromise."
