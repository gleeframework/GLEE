"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
