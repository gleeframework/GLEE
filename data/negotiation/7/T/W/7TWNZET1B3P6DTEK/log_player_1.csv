"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly, which could encourage him to make a serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum value for the product.  While I would ideally like to get more, accepting this offer guarantees I won't lose money and still allows me to move on to other opportunities."
