{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, which gives me the best chance of getting as close to my $150 goal as possible.  I've also added a friendly message to try and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
