You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than the $1,000,000 you are willing to pay, and it's lower than what you believe the product is worth to you.  Therefore, accepting the offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
