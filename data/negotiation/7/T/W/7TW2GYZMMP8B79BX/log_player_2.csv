Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a great price for both of us.
