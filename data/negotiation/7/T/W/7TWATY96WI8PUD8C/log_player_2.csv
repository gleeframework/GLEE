Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is your maximum budget, it's always beneficial to see if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a good strategy. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This gives Alice room to counter, while also demonstrating your intention to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is within your budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves you $5 compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at the higher price."
