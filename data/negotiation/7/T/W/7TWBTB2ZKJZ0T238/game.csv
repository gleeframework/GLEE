"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $100? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my max budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $110. This is my final offer, let me know if you're able to accept it.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $120. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",120.0,Alice,5,
