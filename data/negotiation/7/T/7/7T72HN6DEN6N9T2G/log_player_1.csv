Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to aim higher. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, giving us a negotiation range.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 positions it as a premium purchase while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal compared to our fallback offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing an extra $450,000 outweighs the risk of going directly to our guaranteed sale price."
