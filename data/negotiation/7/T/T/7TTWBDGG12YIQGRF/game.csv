"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I think $10000 is still a bit too low. I can do $11500, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
