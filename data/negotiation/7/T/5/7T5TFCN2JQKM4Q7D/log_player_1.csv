{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language (""fantastic"", ""perfect"") to make Bob feel good about the product and more inclined to accept the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question, signaling that I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, even if it takes some back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John is a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120 gives me the leverage to hold out for a more favorable offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $90 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's a good compromise and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  My counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price point, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the ""compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Fair Profit:**  I reiterate that the price allows me to make a ""fair profit,"" subtly reminding Bob that the price isn't unreasonable.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm showing I'm not desperate for a sale and am confident I can secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Close to the Middle:**  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have the safety net of John's $120 offer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that's significantly below my ideal. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  With some more back-and-forth, I think I can convince Bob to pay closer to $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I can still make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I highlight the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the price is good for ""both of us,"" encouraging Bob to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone throughout the message, avoiding any aggressive or pushy language.

**At this point, I'm confident that Bob is likely to accept my offer. If he rejects it, I'll have no problem selling the product to John for $120, as my minimum acceptable price has been met.**"
