"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $90 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's a good compromise and still allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I can still make a decent profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
