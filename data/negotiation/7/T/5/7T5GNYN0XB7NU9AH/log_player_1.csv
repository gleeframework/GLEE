Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so this gives him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but you also value the product. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get a better price than selling to John while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a nice product, but I was hoping to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price and Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate. There's potential to get closer to your ideal price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product!  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $95. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:** It's in the middle of your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **It shows flexibility:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of you.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob still wants a lower price, there's still some wiggle room to work with.

This counteroffer increases your chances of securing a better price than selling to John while still being reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $95 is closer to your asking price. How about we settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is a good price. It's higher than selling to John, and it's closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offers.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance that Bob might walk away if you reject his offer. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal completely."
