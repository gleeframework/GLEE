Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target. He's already indicated his willingness to pay $11,000, and Alice hasn't budged significantly.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000, Bob should choose to buy it from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice and risk ending up paying more."
