"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. Would you consider a counteroffer of $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're aiming for a specific budget, however, the value of this product significantly surpasses that figure. I'm willing to move down to $950,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my strong interest in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $775,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm open to finding a solution, so I'm proposing $875,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,5,
