"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1400000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit higher in my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1450000 to show my commitment to this deal. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but unfortunately, I cannot meet your price of $1450000.
