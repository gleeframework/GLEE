Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation and the potential for a larger profit. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value creates a negotiation anchor. It gives you leverage to potentially meet somewhere in the middle that still benefits you significantly.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer. This allows you to be bolder in your initial ask, as you're not desperate to make the sale to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, your negotiation position weakens."
