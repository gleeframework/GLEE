"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth negotiating, especially since Alice's initial offer is significantly above your desired price point. By rejecting, you can start the counter-offer process and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay up to $850,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you're not willing to pay John's price of $800,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would still represent a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's now closer to your target. You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so it's likely that further negotiation will get you a lower price.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to avoid potentially getting a worse deal or risking losing the product entirely."
