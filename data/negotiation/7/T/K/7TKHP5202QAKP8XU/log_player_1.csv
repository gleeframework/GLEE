Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob doesn't reject the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below her absolute minimum allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to be firmer with Bob.

**Why this is better than offering a price closer to Bob's valuation:**

While offering a price closer to $8,000 might seem tempting, it leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. Bob has no incentive to negotiate upwards, and Alice might end up selling the product for far less than she could have gotten."
