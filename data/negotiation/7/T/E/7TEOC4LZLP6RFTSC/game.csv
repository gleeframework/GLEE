"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. However,  $16,000 is still a stretch for me. Could you consider $12,000? I feel that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer. I'm willing to make one last push at $13,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000, Bob. I'm starting to think that $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $14,000, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
