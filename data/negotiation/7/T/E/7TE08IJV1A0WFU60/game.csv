"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
