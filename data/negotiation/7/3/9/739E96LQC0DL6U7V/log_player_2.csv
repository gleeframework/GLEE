"Round 1
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. It's too expensive. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

While $100 is better than $120, it's still above what the product is worth to me.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
