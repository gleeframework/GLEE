"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also take on the cost of shipping and handling. Can we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to cover shipping and handling.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my bottom line, I need to stay above $1,300,000. How about we settle at $1,325,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end and reflects my eagerness to work with you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll make one last offer: $1,200,000, and I'm willing to pay cash upfront to seal the deal. Can you consider this final offer?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
