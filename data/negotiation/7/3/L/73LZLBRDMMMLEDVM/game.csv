"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000 for the product.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $875,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $887,500 for the product.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $887,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer you the product for $893,750. Let's try to close this deal - I'm confident this is a good price for both of us.",893750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'll offer $890,000 for the product, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer.",890000.0,Bob,6,
