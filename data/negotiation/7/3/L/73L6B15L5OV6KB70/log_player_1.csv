Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating language:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Prepared for rejection:** I'm aware Bob might reject this offer, so I'm ready to counteroffer if needed.
* **John as backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm during negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob acknowledged the product's value, and his offer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial assessment. 
* **John provides safety:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 allows me to be more aggressive in my counteroffer without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than my initial offer, suggesting I'm open to compromise. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that it benefits both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I'm encouraging Bob to act quickly to avoid losing the opportunity. 
* **John as leverage:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence in my counteroffer and allows me to be firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's try $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing a clear willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" to create a positive and encouraging tone.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **John as backup:**  I'm still confident that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me the leverage to hold firm on my counteroffer."
