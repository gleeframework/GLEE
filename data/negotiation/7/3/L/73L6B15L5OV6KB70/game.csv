"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's try $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to offer a final price of $1,000,000.  This is the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
