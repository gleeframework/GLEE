We're still significantly above John's offer, and have room to negotiate further with Bob.  It's too early to settle for John's price."

Let's see if Bob bites at this offer. It's a significant compromise but still leaves us with a substantial profit over John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but he's incrementally increasing his offers. Accepting his offer of $1,625,000 is a good deal, netting us a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
