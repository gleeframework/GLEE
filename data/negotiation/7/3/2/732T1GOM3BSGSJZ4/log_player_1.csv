Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I think I can push for a better price, considering he values the product at $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,300,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I still need to secure at least $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's settle on this and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on $1,300,000, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. It's getting too risky to keep negotiating. Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a safer option to guarantee a sale and avoid losing out entirely."
