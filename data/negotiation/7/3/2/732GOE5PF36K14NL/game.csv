I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $140? It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  If that's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $145, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",145.0,Alice,5,,
