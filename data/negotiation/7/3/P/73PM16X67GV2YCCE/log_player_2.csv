"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

$20,000 is far above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $16,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
