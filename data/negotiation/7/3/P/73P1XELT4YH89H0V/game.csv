"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, we're not willing to sell the product at $6,000. We're willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price we're willing to consider, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we're not willing to go as low as $7,250. We're willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the best price we can offer, considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
