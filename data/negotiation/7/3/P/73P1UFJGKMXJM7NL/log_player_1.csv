"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a good profit for myself. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent profit and I'm getting closer to my initial goal. There's a risk of further negotiation but I'm not confident I'll get a much better offer from Bob.  Selling to John would net me less, so accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
