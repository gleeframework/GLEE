"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to increase your bid. However, $9,000 is still not enough for me to let go of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Would you consider $9,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a final compromise from my side, and it reflects the value of the product while accommodating your needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement and make this deal happen.",9500.0,Alice,7,
