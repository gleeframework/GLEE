"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $12,000 offer gives me room to negotiate down without going below my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a deal as close to $15,000 as possible. This first offer is a starting point. I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, it eliminates the possibility of a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  My goal is to reach a price closer to my desired range while still keeping the deal open with Bob. I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to entice Bob while not giving away too much ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Appeal to value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired range while still being appealing to Bob. This counteroffer offers a fair price while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than my desired price and the value of the product to me.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **John is still an option:** Selling to John guarantees a higher price, but it eliminates any chance of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  My counteroffer will be a compromise, but I'll be firm in my negotiation, keeping in mind that I can still walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to increase your bid. However, $9,000 is still not enough for me to let go of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Would you consider $9,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a small concession from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much ground. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of logic. 
* **Win-win potential:**  I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement, hoping to motivate Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that time is running out. This offer is a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and the value of the product to me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's offer shows he is willing to negotiate further, and there is still room to reach a higher price.
* **John is still an option:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to that price with Bob, especially with limited rounds left.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I will aim for a price closer to $9,500, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal. I'll need to be careful in my counteroffer as time is running out, and I want to make sure I don't push Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a final compromise from my side, and it reflects the value of the product while accommodating your needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm positioning this offer as my final compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway while also signaling that further concessions are unlikely.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this offer still represents a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning ""making the deal happen,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, implying that further negotiation may be difficult.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's budget. It's a calculated risk, as I'm not sure if Bob will accept. However, I'm confident that this price is still fair and beneficial for me, considering my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely choose to sell to John in the next round, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
