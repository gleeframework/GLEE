"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product is worth $8,000 to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $9,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to his target, there's still a $1,500 difference between her offer and what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get even closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,250, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a new price of $9,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to get the product.  While $9,400 is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and only $400 more than his last offer.  Accepting this offer means he can secure the product without risking losing it to another buyer (John) or having the negotiations go on indefinitely."
