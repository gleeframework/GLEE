Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product for a limited time. I believe it will be greatly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Are you interested?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, and you can always come down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately turned off by the price, you know he's likely looking for a bargain. You can then decide whether to lower the price or simply move on to John, your guaranteed buyer.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John willing to pay $12,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation, knowing you won't be left empty-handed."
