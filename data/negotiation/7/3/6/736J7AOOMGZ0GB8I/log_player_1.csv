I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. I'm aiming to maximize my profits while still leaving room for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for such a significant discount. I will reject his offer and attempt to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to secure a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay this price.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential losses, it's more efficient to sell to John immediately."
