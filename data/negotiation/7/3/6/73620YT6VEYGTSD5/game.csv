"Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell you this amazing product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $8500 price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference. How about we agree on $8750? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8750. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $9250? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $8900. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let's finalize the sale at $9000.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference once again and go with $8950. This way, we both get a fair price and can finalize the deal.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John. I'm willing to meet you at $9000 one last time, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. Let's finalize the sale at $9000.",9000.0,Alice,9,
