Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $6,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and I'm hoping to get closer to $7,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the value and the progress we've made."", ""product_price"": 6800}
