{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I hope to:

* **Encourage negotiation:** Bob might be willing to counteroffer, leading to a win-win scenario. 
* **Secure a good deal:**  If Bob accepts, I'll still be earning more than my minimum. 
* **Position for John:** If Bob rejects, I can easily move on to John, guaranteeing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob. My goal is to find a price that is closer to my value while still being within a range that Bob might be willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm still being polite and friendly, acknowledging Bob's interest while emphasizing the value of the product.  
* **Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:
    *  Is closer to my desired price, maximizing potential profit.
    *  Is still within a range that Bob might find acceptable, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I aim to:

* **Maintain momentum:** Keep the negotiation going without immediately jumping to John.
* **Test Bob's willingness:**  See if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **Increase my chances:** If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price than his initial offer, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than what John is offering.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob again.  I will aim for a price closer to my desired value, but I will also consider the possibility of ending the negotiation with Bob and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, which would be $8,875.  It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,875, a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's last offer ($8,750). 
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the fairness of my offer, trying to make it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer:
    * Is closer to my minimum acceptable price, increasing my potential profit.
    * Still leaves room for negotiation, keeping the door open for Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Hope for Acceptance:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a significant improvement over his initial offer. 
* **Prepare for Rejection:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer once more or sell to John. The decision will depend on how much I want to continue negotiating and how confident I am in my chances of getting a better price from Bob."
