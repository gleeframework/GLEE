"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, which would be $8,875.  It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
