Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? This is a great price for a product that's worth much more. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop the price to $95.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're down to the last couple of rounds, and Bob isn't willing to budge much further. It's not worth risking getting stuck with a price that's far below my minimum.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my desired price, so it's the best option for me right now."
