"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $8000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $9000 for the product. This still represents a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000 to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's split the difference - how about $8750? This would allow me to meet your budget while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
