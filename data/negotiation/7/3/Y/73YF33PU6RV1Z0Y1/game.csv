"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would you be open to that?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",8200.0,Alice,5,
