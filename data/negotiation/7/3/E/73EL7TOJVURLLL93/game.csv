"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm getting closer to my limit.  Would you consider $11,100?  That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",11100.0,Bob,6,
