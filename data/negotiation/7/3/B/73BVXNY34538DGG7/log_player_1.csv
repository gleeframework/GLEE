Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Highlighting that I have another buyer lined up (without explicitly mentioning John or the price) adds pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
