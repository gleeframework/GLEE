{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it'll be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits you'll realize, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, the potential for further concessions and the time investment in the negotiation process make selling to John for $800,000 the more efficient choice."
