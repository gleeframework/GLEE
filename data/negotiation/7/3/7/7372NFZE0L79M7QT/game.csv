"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $110.  This still leaves you a good amount of value, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",108.0,Bob,4,
