"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you consider $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $78, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $82, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $82. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $80, which would be $81. That's the best I can do. Take it or leave it.",81.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm still trying to be responsible with my budget. Would you consider $77?",77.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $77, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm willing to make one more offer: $79. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",79.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. Would you consider $76?",76.0,Bob,10,
