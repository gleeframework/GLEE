"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $850000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I believe the product's value is still significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000.  It's a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $875000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see some more movement from your side. Can you consider a compromise at $875000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
