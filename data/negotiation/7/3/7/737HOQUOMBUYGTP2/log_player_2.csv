"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her valuation of the product. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $78? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer ($85) and my last one ($70). It shows a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
