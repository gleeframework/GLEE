"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $9,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
