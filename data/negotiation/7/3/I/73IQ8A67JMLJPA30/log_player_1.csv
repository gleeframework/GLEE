Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is disappointingly low, matching the product's minimum value to me. While I could try to negotiate him higher, there's a risk he won't budge and I'd waste time. John provides a guaranteed $12,000.
