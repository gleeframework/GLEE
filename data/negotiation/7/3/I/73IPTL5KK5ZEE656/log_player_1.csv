Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum value of $1,500,000, and it seems like Bob is firm on this price. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
