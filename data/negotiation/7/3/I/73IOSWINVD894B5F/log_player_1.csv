Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $400,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure a higher price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 secures you a $300,000 profit above your minimum, leaving Bob with a still-attractive $100,000 gain from his valuation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" helps justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price, but not below $1,000,000.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, mentioning other potential buyers could strengthen your position and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Remember:** Negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer starts the conversation and allows room for counter-offers while ensuring you aim for the best possible outcome."
