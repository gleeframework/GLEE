"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations.  My asking price is $1,150,000, which reflects the significant value this product holds.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John if necessary."
