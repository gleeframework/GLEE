Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer you $750000 for the product.  This still represents a good profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
