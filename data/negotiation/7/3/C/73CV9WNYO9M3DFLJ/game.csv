"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer you $750000 for the product.  This still represents a good profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
