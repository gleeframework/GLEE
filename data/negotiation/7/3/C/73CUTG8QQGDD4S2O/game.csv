"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
