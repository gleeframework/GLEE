Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,500 is more than $10,000, so Bob has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, so I have room to negotiate down if needed. 

I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least get closer to my minimum. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $12,000. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up in his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
