,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $87.50 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Let's compromise at $89. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
