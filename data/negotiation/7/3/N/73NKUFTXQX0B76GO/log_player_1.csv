Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
