"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is still a little lower than what I need to make this work. How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep working towards a deal.  $10,750 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
