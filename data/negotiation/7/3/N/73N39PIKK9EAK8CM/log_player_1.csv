Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to settle for anything less than my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,600,000 is still a good price and above my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing the deal and potentially having to sell to John for less."
