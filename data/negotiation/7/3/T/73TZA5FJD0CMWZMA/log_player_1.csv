"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $1,000,000, which is your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not starting too high, giving Bob space to counter.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired range. You want to maximize your profit, and selling for $1,200,000 would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the product's value to you. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to your desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, I'm still looking for closer to $1,300,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the product's true value to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above your minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Compromise and flexibility:** You're moving slightly towards Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the value to Bob:** You're reminding him of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to meet you halfway. 

This counteroffer maintains a balance between pushing for a higher price and keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,400,000,  $1,250,000 is a good compromise. Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **It's getting closer to my desired price:**  I've already moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, and Bob has also moved up.
* **Time is a factor:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and continuing to haggle might risk losing the deal altogether. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good price while minimizing the risk of losing a potential sale."
