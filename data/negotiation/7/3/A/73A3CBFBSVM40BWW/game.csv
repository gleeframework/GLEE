"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still offers you a significant value. This is a fair price considering the worth of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
