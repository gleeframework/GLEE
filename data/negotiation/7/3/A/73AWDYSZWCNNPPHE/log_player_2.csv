Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept an offer of $890000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value we both see in the product and the financial considerations involved. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  Given that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and the price is significantly lower than buying from John, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on a good deal outweighs the potential savings."
