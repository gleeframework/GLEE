This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties, highlighting the price advantage Bob could get compared to other buyers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
