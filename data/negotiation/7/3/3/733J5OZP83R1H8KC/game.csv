"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from other buyers. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
