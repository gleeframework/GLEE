Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me.  I'm confident he'll find this offer attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $85 just yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $90. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to him and my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer, as it's closer to my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I would prefer to sell for closer to $90, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at this point and avoid any further potential delays."
