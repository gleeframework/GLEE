Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the opportunity for both of us to close a deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and it would give you a decent profit while still fitting within my budget. Let's try to work together and reach an agreement.
