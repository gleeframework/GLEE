"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that can benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the opportunity for both of us to close a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a good price considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a step in the right direction, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and it would give you a decent profit while still fitting within my budget. Let's try to work together and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While we've made some progress,  it's clear that we are not going to be able to reach a deal that works for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
