{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $160, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being polite and framing the price as fair, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is significantly lower than what I need to sell the product. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need.  I'll reject and try to get a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 125}
