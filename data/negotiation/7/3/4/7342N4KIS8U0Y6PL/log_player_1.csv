Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention that the product is ""amazing"" to subtly emphasize its worth without revealing my true minimum. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay more. If he rejects, I can use the information to adjust my subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or no sale at all.  Selling to John would result in the same price, but accepting Bob's offer is a faster and more decisive outcome."
