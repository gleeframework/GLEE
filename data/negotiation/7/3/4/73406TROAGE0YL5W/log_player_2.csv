"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $15000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  While she claims the product is worth $15,000, this is irrelevant. Your goal is to save money. Since you can buy the same product from John for $8,000, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer."
