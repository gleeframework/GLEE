Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,100,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth the price given its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  It's too risky to accept at this point, as I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price of $1,000,000, and it's within a reasonable range.  It's also a good price considering the risk of continued negotiation."
