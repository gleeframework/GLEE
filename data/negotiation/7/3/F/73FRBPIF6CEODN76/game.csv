"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,800,000 to you. To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,600,000. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value you've mentioned.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move things forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price for the product.  However, $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which represents a significant compromise for me. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. To find a common ground, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This offer is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget limitations.  I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
