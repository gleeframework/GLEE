Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting more than your minimum price.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $130.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is still below my desired price point, it's closer to my minimum of $150 and is within a reasonable negotiating range.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate might lead to further price drops, potentially resulting in me selling the product for less than what John is offering.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial decision at this point."
