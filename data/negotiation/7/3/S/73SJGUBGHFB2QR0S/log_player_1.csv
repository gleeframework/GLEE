Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation downward. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it anchors the price high.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you want to maximize profit, you also want to give Bob a reason to negotiate. If he counters, you can always go lower, knowing your minimum is covered by John's offer."
