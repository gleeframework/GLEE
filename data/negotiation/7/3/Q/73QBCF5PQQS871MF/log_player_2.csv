"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for me. I understand that the true worth of this item may be subjective and varies greatly depending on its intended use. With that in mind, I am extending a special offer to you. If you are interested in exploring the possibilities of this product for your needs or desires, I am willing to consider a negotiation. However, to start our discussion, my initial offer for the product is $750000. Please let me know if this is within your consideration range, and we can proceed from there. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $450,000, which is a substantial amount. Even if the product's true value to Alice is higher than $750,000, Bob still benefits by accepting the offer."
