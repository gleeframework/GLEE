Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is unlikely to go higher than $12,000.  It's better to take John's guaranteed offer than risk Bob not budging."
