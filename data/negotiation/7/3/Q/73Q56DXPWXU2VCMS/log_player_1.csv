Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but at a slow pace. We are now at round 6 out of 10, and his latest offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,500,000. 

While we could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll reach $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds. It's strategically safer to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling below our desired price."
