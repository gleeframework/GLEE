"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, and that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
