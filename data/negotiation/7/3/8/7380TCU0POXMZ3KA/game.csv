"Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? That's the midpoint between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's consider $10500.  This compromise allows for a deal that benefits both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is $500 below your last offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",9000.0,Bob,6,
