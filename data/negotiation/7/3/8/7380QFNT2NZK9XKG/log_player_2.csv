"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $950,000.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $900000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and there's still a gap between Alice's offer and that value.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."
