"Round 1

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a final price of $1,125,000.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer in this round aims for a final price of $1,125,000. This is a significant step towards Bob's target price of $1,000,000, while still offering a price that is likely acceptable to Alice. 

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Significant Compromise:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal.
* **Target Price in Sight:**  Bob is now just $125,000 away from his target price.  
* **Emphasizing a Win-Win:** The message frames the offer as a ""win-win"" scenario, highlighting the benefits for both parties.

By taking this approach, Bob can potentially close the deal in the next round while still saving a significant amount of money."
