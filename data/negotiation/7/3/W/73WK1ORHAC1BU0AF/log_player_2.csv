Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is getting closer to your desired price point. At this point, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. If you reject this offer and counter again, there's a chance Alice will walk away or raise her price again. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within your budget and reasonably close to your target price."
