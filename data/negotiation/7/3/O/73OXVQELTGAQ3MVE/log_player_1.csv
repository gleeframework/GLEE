I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  I've made several counteroffers to Bob, but he's not willing to go any higher than $137.50.  Since this is below my minimum price, I'm not comfortable selling it to him. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it makes more sense to sell to him."
