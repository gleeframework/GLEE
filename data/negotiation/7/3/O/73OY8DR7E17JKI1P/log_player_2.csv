"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a decent price, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to stay under his $12,000 budget. While $13,000 is a slight improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still not acceptable. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it's still within my budget. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but $12,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,900 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget limit but still wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,900 is a great price, it's still outside his ideal budget. He should see if he can negotiate a final price of $12,750 or something closer to that in the next round. If that fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,900 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. This is a fair compromise and will allow us to both benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
