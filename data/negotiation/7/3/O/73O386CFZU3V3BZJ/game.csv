"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, given the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $1,100,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from the deal, and I believe it's a reasonable price given the product's value.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
