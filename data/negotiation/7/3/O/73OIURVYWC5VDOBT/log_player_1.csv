Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my minimum value of $15,000 through counteroffers, but I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to secure a sale quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our previous offers. I believe this price is fair, and it gives Bob a chance to secure the product at a price that is still below what it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting too close to my minimum value of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price. It's better to secure the sale with John at $15,000, which guarantees I get my minimum desired value."
