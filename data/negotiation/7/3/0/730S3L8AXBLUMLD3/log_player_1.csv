Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a good deal while also ensuring I get a profit beyond my minimum value of $100.  I'm open to negotiation, but I want to see what Bob's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept $100, as it's my minimum value.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm coming down to $125. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $115 is above my minimum value and gives me some profit. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk further negotiation, potentially losing more money or having to sell to John for $100."
