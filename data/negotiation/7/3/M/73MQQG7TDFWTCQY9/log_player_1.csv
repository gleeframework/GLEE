"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering.  While I agree this is a great product, $13,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It makes sense to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we possibly settle around $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

Bob is inching closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. Holding out for a higher offer from Bob or taking John's offer are both preferable at this point."
