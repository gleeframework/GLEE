"Hello Alice, thanks for offering.  While I agree this is a great product, $13,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we possibly settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  To be completely fair, let's meet halfway at $9,500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
