"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $600,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe your product is of high quality, the price point is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $400,000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point. However, $550,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'd be willing to meet you at $450,000.  This seems like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $520,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for myself. What do you think?",520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience with this negotiation. I'm still very interested in the product, but $520,000 is pushing my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $485,000? I feel this is a fair offer that reflects both of our interests.",485000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $485,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $510,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and the concessions I've made so far. What do you think?",510000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I understand you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $495,000.  This is a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.  Hopefully, this brings us to an agreement.",495000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $505,000, which is just $5,000 more than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",505000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $500,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to pursue other options.",500000.0,Bob,10,
