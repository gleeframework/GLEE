"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum price of $8,000, ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum value of $12,000, giving him a potential gain. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a possible win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, rejecting it makes sense for the following reasons:

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob clearly values the product at $12,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a price closer to $10,000 or even higher.
* **Limited rounds:** You have only 10 rounds, so rejecting an offer that's too low allows you more time to work towards a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, selling to John for $8,000 ensures you don't lose money. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you show you are determined to get a fair price and keep the door open for a more profitable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Compromise:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for you.
* **Reasonable price:** $9,000 is closer to Bob's $8,000 than your previous offer, making it more attractive.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this round:

* **Profit:** $8,500 is higher than your minimum price of $8,000, securing a profit for you.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a slightly higher price is possible, it's not guaranteed. Accepting this offer provides a decent profit with less risk of ending up with no sale.
* **John's offer:**  Remember, John is willing to buy for $8,000, making Bob's offer a better option at this point.

While there's always the temptation to push for more, sometimes securing a solid profit is the best strategy."
