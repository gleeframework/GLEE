"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there though. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,060,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
