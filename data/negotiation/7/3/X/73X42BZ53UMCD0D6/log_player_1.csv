{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I consider the product's minimum value to me. I'm hoping Bob will find it appealing enough to accept, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  It's worth at least $150 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate but not that far down.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $140 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $130 is still too low for me. I'm not comfortable going below my minimum value of $150.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum price I'm looking for."
