"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and gives you a substantial profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
