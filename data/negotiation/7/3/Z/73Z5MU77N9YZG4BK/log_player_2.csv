"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Could you do $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, aiming to see how much she's willing to negotiate. It leaves room for further bargaining if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is a better price, Alice stating it's ""the lowest she'll go"" could be a negotiation tactic. I'll push a bit further to see if there's any flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest price. It shows a willingness to compromise but also maintains pressure to reach a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,800. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $6,800 is a good deal and further haggling risks losing the opportunity. It's better to secure the product at this price rather than risk having to buy from John for $8,000."
