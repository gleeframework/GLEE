"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to securing a better price."
