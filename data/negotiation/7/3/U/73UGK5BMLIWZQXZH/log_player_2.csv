"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it's important to start lower to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Setting an Anchor:** This counteroffer establishes a price point closer to your desired range and may encourage Alice to significantly lower her expectations. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes your interest while making it clear that the initial price is a dealbreaker."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial price. How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price that would still leave you with a significant profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While she came down in price, it's clear there's likely room for further negotiation. You can try to nudge her closer to your range. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer as a backup option provides leverage.  You're not desperate to accept a price above your limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you meet me in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message firmly states your maximum budget while also emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price.
* **Time Constraint:** As you progress through the rounds, introducing a slight sense of urgency can be beneficial.  Mentioning it's your absolute limit may encourage Alice to make a decision."
