"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's talk!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial price. How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price that would still leave you with a significant profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you meet me in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
