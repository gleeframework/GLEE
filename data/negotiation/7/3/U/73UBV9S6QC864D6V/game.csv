"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,225,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,237,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1237500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,237,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'm not going any higher. Can we meet in the middle?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
