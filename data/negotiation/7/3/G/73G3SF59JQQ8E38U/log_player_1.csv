"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while leaving space for counteroffers. I'm also framing it as a win-win situation to make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $95 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98, as a final offer.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
