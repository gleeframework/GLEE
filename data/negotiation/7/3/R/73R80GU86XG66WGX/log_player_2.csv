"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
