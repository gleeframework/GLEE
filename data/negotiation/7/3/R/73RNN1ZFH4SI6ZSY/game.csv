"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we settle on $2,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
