"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your offer. However, I must respectfully decline at this time. I am unable to agree to $8500 due to the value I place on the product. I propose a counteroffer of $9500. This amount reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable return for us. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option for me. Can you think of a better price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
