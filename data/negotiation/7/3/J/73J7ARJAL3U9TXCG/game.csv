"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature and your potential gain, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price.  However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000. That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
