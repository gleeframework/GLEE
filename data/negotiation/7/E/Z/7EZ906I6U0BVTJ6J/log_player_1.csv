Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $150 (my minimum). If the negotiation stalls, I'll simply sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
