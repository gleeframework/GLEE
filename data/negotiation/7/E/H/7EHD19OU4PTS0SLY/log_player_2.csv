"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you directly. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay.  You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This price reflects a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at $1,087,500. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying even more.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is still within your budget and a significant discount from John's offer."
