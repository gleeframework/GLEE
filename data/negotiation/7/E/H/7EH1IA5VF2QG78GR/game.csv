"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'd love to move forward with the purchase at this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $13500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I can do $15000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let's talk turkey!",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering I've already made some concessions. I'd love to hear if you can meet me at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
