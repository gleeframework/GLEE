{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, so you absolutely won't go below that.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without scaring him off. Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiating tactics, you might adjust the price slightly."
