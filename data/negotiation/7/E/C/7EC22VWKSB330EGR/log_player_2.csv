"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could get the product for $150 from John, Alice's offer of $120 is still within your budget of $150 and saves you $30.  It's a better deal than John's."
