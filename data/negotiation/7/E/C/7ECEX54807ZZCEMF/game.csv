"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $11,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $7,500?  That would be a good compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let's try $9,500.  This is a significant price drop and  a fair offer considering what I'm willing to part with it for.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make a deal. How about $8,000 even?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
