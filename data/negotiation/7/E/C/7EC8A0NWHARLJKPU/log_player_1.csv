Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John will buy it for that amount if Bob declines.  This gives Bob a chance to counteroffer, but it also sets a clear baseline for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly to $95, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to drop below my desired range too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low for me.  Since I know John is willing to pay $100, it makes more sense to sell to him rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
