"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
