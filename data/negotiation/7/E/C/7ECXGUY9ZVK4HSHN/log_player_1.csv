Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $100. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm not confident I can reach a price I'm comfortable with. John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed sale."
