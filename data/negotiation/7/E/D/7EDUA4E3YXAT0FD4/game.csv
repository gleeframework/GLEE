"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $1,400,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,375,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also fitting within my budget.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle on $1,390,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
