"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
