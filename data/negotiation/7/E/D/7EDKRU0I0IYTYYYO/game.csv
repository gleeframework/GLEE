"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $700,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $650,000, which is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on.  Let's find a deal that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I'm still not quite there. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can get closer to the sweet spot. I'll make one more compromise, but I'm not going any lower than $675,000.",675000.0,Alice,5,
