"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $700,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite high. I'm going to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $650,000, which is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on.  Let's find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I'm still not quite there. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can get closer to the sweet spot. I'll make one more compromise, but I'm not going any lower than $675,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made a significant concession, and her final offer is very close to my ideal price. It's time to close the deal."
