"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $130 is higher than both your maximum price ($100) and what John is offering ($100).  It makes the most sense to buy from John and get the best price."
