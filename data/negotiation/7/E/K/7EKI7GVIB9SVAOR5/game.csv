"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives you a great deal on a product worth much more.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $150? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",150.0,Bob,4,
