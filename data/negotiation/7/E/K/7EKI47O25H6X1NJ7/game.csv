"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000 or less. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price point?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the offer, I am still not able to meet at $12000. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $9500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll find it acceptable. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer $10000 for the product. I believe this to be a fair price given its current condition and features. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,6,
