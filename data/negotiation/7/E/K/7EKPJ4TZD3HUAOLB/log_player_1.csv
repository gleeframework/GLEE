"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. My starting price is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can negotiate down from there. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A $12,000 price leaves room for negotiation without feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he is interested in the product. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I still have 8 rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob. It's worth exploring further negotiation before settling for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000? That's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows my willingness to find a solution we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a significant compromise by dropping from $12,000 to $9,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm not just throwing out a number.  I'm explaining the price reduction and framing it as a way to reach a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, as Bob may be willing to go up a little bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the compromise, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob is clearly interested and we're getting closer. I still have rounds remaining and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's offer:** John's offer is always a fallback option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Final Offer Tone:**  While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm hinting that this may be my final offer."
