"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000? That's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows my willingness to find a solution we both agree on.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the compromise, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
