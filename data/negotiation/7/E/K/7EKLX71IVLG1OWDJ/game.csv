"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still provides you with significant value and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
