Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
*  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer is attractive to him. 
* This initial offer sets a high starting point for the negotiation and allows me to explore if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value. 

I'm hoping Bob accepts this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further. I'll keep the John offer in mind as a backup if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still significantly lower than my ideal price.
* I am confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer.
* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also maintains a price point that is closer to my desired value.
* It is likely that Bob will accept this offer, as it is closer to his perceived value than his previous offer and still leaves him with a profit. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to further lower my price or accept the offer from John, which is still a reasonable outcome."
