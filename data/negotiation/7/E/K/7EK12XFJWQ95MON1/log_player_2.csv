{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, she clearly states she believes the product is worth $15,000 to you. This suggests she may be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you encourage her to potentially propose a better deal, bringing you closer to your goal of maximizing savings. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
