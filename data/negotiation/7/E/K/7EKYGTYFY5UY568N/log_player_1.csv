{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $119, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might be willing to pay while still exceeding my minimum sale price."
