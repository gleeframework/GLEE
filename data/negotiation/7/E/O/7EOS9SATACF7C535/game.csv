"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both the value of the product and my financial situation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between the product's value and my financial capacity.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'll make another counteroffer: $1100000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued efforts, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest proposal and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline. I am unable to meet at $1100000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to suggest a final offer of $1050000. This represents a compromise that respects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one final counteroffer: $1080000. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
