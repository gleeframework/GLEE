"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also signaling that I'm open to negotiation, to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that is significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also highlighting the benefits for Bob in accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's the best offer I've received so far and it meets my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate will only reduce the price further, so I'm choosing to close the deal."
