Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 seems more appealing than a rounded number like $120, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the price.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at his perceived value of $80 would work, but you'd leave potential profit on the table."
