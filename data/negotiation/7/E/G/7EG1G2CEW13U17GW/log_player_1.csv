Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This product is truly valuable, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum, but it's still not enough. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I'll be able to close the deal with Bob. It's better to sell to John for $1,200,000 and secure the best possible outcome."
