"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential benefits of the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still giving me a reasonable profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his desired price. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if he can get the price down to $12,000 or less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price that considers your need for a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
