"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential benefits of the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still giving me a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is a fair price that considers your need for a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
