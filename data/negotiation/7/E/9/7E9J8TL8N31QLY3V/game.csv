,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",85.0,Alice,5,
