{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, highlighting the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a higher price to maximize my potential profit. I'm also willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $100. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counteroffer. If the negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $110 but still above Bob's offer of $60. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. By counteroffering at $90, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't sell the product for less than $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $90, but still above Bob's offer of $75. 
* **Message:** I'm continuing to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product. I'm also acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price while still being within Bob's perceived value range. My goal is to find a price that both of us can agree on."
