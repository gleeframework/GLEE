"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting that the product is valuable to him, which increases his incentive to agree.
* **Positive and Open:**  The message is friendly and invites conversation, creating a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $150. A $100 offer is still a good deal for him, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Room for Profit:** While $100 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price range with more negotiation.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, I show Bob I'm not desperate and am willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $110, he's getting the product at a significant discount compared to its value to him.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" deal for both of us, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $105 is very close to my desired price range and significantly better than selling to John.
* **Final Offer:** Bob has clearly stated this is his final offer, indicating a willingness to walk away if I reject.
* **Risk of Loss:**  There's a high risk of losing a sale by rejecting, especially with only 6 rounds remaining."
