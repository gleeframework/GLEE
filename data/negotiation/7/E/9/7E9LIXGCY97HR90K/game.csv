,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",105.0,Bob,4,
