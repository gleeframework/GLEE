"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is overpriced at $15,000. You know you can get the product for its true value of $12,000 from John. There's no reason to spend more than necessary."
