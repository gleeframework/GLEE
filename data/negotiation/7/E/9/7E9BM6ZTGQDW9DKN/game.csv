"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $9,000. I'd be willing to go up to $8,200. Can you meet me there?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $8,200 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
