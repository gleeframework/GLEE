{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, which might make Bob more willing to engage. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not explicitly stating this, but my tone leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response to decide my next move:
    * **Accepting Offer:** I'll sell the product for $10,000.
    * **Rejecting with Counteroffer:** I'll evaluate the counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. 
    * **Rejecting without Counteroffer:** I'll either make a counteroffer or consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  He clearly values the product, and I can likely push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but it would be ideal to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target. I will keep in mind that I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to avoid a deadlock with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to be flexible while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I highlight that the price is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the value of the product.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  My message is friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to consider my offer and potentially make another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's Response:** I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.
* **Prepare for More Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer or make another counteroffer. 
* **Consider John's Offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $9,000. I'd be willing to go up to $8,200. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $12,000 threshold. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for a Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding the Safe Option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is secure, but I want to explore all options to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. My goal is to bridge the gap while staying within my acceptable range. I will also be prepared to consider John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $8,200 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer of $8,600 is exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($8,200) and my previous offer ($9,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to see it as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer brings us closer to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) without putting too much pressure on Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate Further:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to decide whether to accept his next offer or make another counteroffer, always keeping John's $12,000 offer as a fallback option.
* **Prioritize Profit:**  My goal is to reach a deal that is as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
