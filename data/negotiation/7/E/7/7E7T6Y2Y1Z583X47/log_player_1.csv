"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup, but I'm confident the product is valuable enough to Bob that he might consider it.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price that's significantly lower than what I value the product at. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a more reasonable compromise while still ensuring I get a profit. I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and finally come to an agreement.  I'm also getting closer to John's offer, so I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1 million, and I'm getting a little concerned that this negotiation might not get me a better deal.  However, I'm going to make one final counteroffer in the next round. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is my minimum price. If Bob rejects this, I will sell the product to John."
