I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to take a look?,9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500 again, as I believe it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $7500 is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $7800. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",7800.0,Alice,5,
