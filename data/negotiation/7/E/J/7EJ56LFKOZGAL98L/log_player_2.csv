"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her maximum value. There's no room for negotiation to save money.  You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door to potentially finding a better deal, even if it means ultimately buying from John."
