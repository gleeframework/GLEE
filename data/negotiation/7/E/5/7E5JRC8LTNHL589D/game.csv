"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10000, but I'm afraid it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet at $13000. I would like to propose $12000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",12000.0,Bob,4,
