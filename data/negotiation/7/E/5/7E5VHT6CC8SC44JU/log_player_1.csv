Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's not the full $120 value to Bob, leaving him room to potentially counteroffer.
* **Is above your minimum:** It's more than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Shows flexibility:** The message indicates you're willing to negotiate, which can help keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is still below my ideal price, it is above my minimum of $100 and the risk of going another round with Bob might lead to a lower price, or even him walking away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
