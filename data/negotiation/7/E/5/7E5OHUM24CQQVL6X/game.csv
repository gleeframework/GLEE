,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $10,500, which is a substantial compromise on my end.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Perhaps we could meet in the middle somewhere?  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
