{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations without immediately needing to sell to John. 

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a price closer to my minimum value of $10,000. If Bob rejects, I can then assess whether his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $9,500. Accepting it would mean taking a considerable loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is showing interest, it's clear he's trying to negotiate a low price. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, making him a reliable backup if negotiations with Bob don't work out. 

I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price, but if his counteroffers stay too low, I'll choose to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope you'll reconsider. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from $9,500 to $9,000, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the offer's fairness.
* **Open communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that balances my desire for a good price with the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,750 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. While it's closer than Bob's previous offer, accepting it would mean a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation isn't going smoothly:**  Bob's offers are consistently too low, and it seems he's not willing to budge much.  Continuing to negotiate with him might prolong the process without any guarantee of a better price.
* **John remains the safer option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price.  It's becoming increasingly clear that getting a better deal from Bob is unlikely.

I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob if his counteroffer is closer to my minimum value. But given his current stance, selling to John seems like the best course of action at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $8,750 is still too far below what I need for this product. I'm willing to go to $9,250 to bridge the gap. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best chance we have to make a deal. Please consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm increasing my offer from $9,000 to $9,250, showing a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining my value:**  $9,250 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Last chance for a deal:**  I'm framing this as a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. This could encourage him to consider a higher price, knowing a rejection might mean losing the opportunity.

This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my side, but it still allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer.  If Bob rejects again, I will likely accept John's offer."
