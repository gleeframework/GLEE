"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope you'll reconsider. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $8,750 is still too far below what I need for this product. I'm willing to go to $9,250 to bridge the gap. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best chance we have to make a deal. Please consider it carefully.",9250.0,Alice,5,
