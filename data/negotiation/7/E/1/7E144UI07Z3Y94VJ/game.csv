"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
