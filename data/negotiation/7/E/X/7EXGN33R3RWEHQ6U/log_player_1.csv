"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states my openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that this is not a take-it-or-leave-it situation. 
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** By highlighting the product's value and potential, I'm aiming to justify the high initial price and create a sense that Bob would be getting a worthwhile deal. 
 
This strategy balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to engage Bob in a meaningful negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'll aim for a higher price in the next round, knowing Bob is seriously interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Are you open to discussing this price point?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've significantly reduced my asking price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price point significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification and Openness:** I'm reiterating the product's value while expressing my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering with $1,450,000, I'm aiming to steer the negotiation towards a final price hopefully above $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer and a good compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  We're now in Round 4, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a much higher offer from Bob.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($150,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later in the negotiation. 
 
While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the gains are unlikely to outweigh the risks of continued negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer now ensures a good deal and a quick sale."
