"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting high, but not too high. I want to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.  I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so this offer gives him a good deal while still leaving me with a healthy margin."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a good profit margin. I hope this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe we can reach a deal that's better for both of us.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also keeping an eye on John as a potential buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer. I'm confident that $1,350,000 is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit."

This offer is very close to my desired price. I'm happy to accept it, as it secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
