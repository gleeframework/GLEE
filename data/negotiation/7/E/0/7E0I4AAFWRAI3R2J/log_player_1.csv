Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could start lower, aiming high initially allows for potential negotiation or a quick sale at a great price.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but less than what John will pay ($150), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice will need to decide whether to lower the price further or proceed with selling to John at $150."
