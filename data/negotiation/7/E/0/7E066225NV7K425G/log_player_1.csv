Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not willing to drop below $9,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're sticking to your price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to drop to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. How about we meet at $8,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, $8,600 is only $400 away from my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing it and ending up with nothing."
