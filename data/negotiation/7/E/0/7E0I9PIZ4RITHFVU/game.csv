"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still give you a great deal on the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial situation, $975,000 is still beyond my budget. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $960,000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",960000.0,Bob,4,
