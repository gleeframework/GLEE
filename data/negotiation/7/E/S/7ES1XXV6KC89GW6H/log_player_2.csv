"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her true value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There are 10 rounds, and buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option, so it's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to continue the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There are still 8 rounds left, and you can always buy from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our respective values and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident that we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above your maximum budget. You have 6 rounds left to negotiate and can still buy from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth continuing to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This price represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer again, but it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You only have 4 rounds left, and the negotiations seem to be slowing down. While you could continue negotiating with Alice, there's a risk that you won't reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you the product and avoids further uncertainty."
