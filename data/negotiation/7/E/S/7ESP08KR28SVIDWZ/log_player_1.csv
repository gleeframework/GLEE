"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm aiming high initially, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high price allows for negotiation and concessions throughout the rounds.
* **Polite and professional tone:**  Building a positive rapport with Bob is important for a successful negotiation. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth to justify the price point. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I want to keep the negotiation collaborative and encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Bob indicating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk losing the opportunity cost of selling to John."
