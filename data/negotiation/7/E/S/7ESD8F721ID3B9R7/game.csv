"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000.  It's the best I can do, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $13,500.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
