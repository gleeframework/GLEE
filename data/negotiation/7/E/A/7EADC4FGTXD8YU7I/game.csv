"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're open to this.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
