"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Cost Analysis:** Alice's offer of $11,200 is only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000. This is a relatively small difference.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate would likely result in further back-and-forth with no guarantee of a lower price. 
* **John's Price:**  John's price of $12,000 is significantly higher, making Alice's offer a more attractive option.

At this point, it makes sense for Bob to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a price that is still lower than John's."
