"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's worth discussing. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. It makes sense to negotiate and see if I can get a better price closer to my $10,000 limit. Buying from John right away would mean missing out on a potentially better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10,500. This still reflects the value of the product while being more accessible to your budget. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still willing to push for a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice.  I appreciate the movement, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,750?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $10,250. This still maintains a fair value for the product while being more accommodating to your financial situation. Let me know if this proposal suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $10,000.  While I might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her not budging and me missing out on John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $10,000 price."
