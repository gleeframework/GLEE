"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I recognize its value, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I can offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
