Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I can offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $900,000 to $850,000, which is a significant move in my favor. While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to my desired range.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
