Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than your $80 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price."
