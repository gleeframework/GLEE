"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",115.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle of $105 and $115, which is $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product is worth $80 to you and I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",108.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,112.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $108 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. Let me know if that works for you.",112.0,Alice,7,,
