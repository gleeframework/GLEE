"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  This will still leave you plenty of room within your budget, and it's a significant step closer to my asking price.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,112,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
