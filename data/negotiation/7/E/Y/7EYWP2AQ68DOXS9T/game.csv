"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $13500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $14250. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $14250. I'd like to propose $13750. Can we meet in the middle again?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think $14000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and what I'm looking to get out of the sale.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13750, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle at $13875. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",13875.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of $13875. I'd like to propose $13500 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13625, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a price that I think is still fair, considering the product's value and what I'm trying to get out of the sale.",13625.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $13625. I'd like to propose $13000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can meet at this point.",13000.0,Bob,10,
