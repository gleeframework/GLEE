Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer ($1,500,000), you set an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely the final price will be closer to your initial offer than if you started lower.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, making it seem potentially even more valuable to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes Bob is motivated by the product's value and potentially willing to pay a premium. If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style or risk appetite, you might adjust your approach.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might offer a slightly lower price to ensure a smoother transaction and future goodwill."
