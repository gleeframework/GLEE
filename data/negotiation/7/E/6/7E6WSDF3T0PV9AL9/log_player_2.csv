"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with your alternative."
