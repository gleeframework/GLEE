"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  While this is above your estimated value, I'm confident its true potential warrants this price."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, providing a reason (even if it's somewhat vague about the ""true potential"") can make it seem less arbitrary to Bob.
* **Leaving Room:** The initial high price leaves ample space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially towards a mutually agreeable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but based on my research and needs, I am proposing a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial valuation, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I can come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's unique features and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  I've made a substantial concession of $200,000, signaling that I'm open to negotiation. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price range.
* **Continuing the Dance:** I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up significantly before considering other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my requirements, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
