Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since Bob values the product at $200,000 more than your minimum, there's room for negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his valuation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Exclusivity:**  Using the phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" can make the offer seem more desirable.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly downward from your initial offer, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
