,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but I'm also open to negotiating further. How about we discuss a price between $1000000 and $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. After this, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to my limit, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is my last serious offer, so please consider it carefully.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $990000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, just like in round 7, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
