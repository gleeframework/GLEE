"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take his $1,050,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'm confident in the product's value and want to ensure I get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while being more agreeable to your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
