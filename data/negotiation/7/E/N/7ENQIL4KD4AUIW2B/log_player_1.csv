Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $65. Bob is interested, and I know the product is worth $80 to him.  I'll counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 75}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $70 is a good price, considering it's still above my minimum of $80. It's a win for both of us!"
