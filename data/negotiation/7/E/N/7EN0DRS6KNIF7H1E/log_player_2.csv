"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable product for less than you'd pay elsewhere, and I'll still make a profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
