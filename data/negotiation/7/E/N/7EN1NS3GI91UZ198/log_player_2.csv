"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $9500. I think it's a great price considering its value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $9,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering your own valuation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9000 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's valuation of $8,000**, but it's a good compromise considering John's price of $10,000.
* **Bob can save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer**, which is a significant amount.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high**, as Alice has already rejected Bob's counteroffer. There's no guarantee she'll accept a lower price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
