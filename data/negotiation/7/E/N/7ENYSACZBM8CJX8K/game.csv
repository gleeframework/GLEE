"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $14,000 for the product. This is the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
