"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start at $900,000. This represents a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous value it brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is far too low.  This product is worth significantly more than that.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being beneficial to you.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
