Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is far too low.  This product is worth significantly more than that.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.
