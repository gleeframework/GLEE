"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
