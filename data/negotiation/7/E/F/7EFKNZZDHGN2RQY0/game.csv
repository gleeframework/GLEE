"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $15000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
