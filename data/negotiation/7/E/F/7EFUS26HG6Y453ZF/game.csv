"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10800. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your previous offer and my original counteroffer, so I'm thinking of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $10200 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a final offer of $10000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
