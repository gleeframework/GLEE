Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This leaves no room for negotiation, but it's the price I need to get to make this sale worthwhile.  If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,100,000.  I'll sell to John to ensure I get a reasonable price."
