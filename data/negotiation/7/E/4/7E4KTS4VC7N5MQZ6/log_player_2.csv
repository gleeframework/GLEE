"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would really benefit you, and I'm asking for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($9,500 > $10,000).**  This means it's not a good deal for you right now.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get the price down by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You can always go to John if the negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no immediate need to take the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Alice's worth:**  $8,500 is only $500 below Alice's worth, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This leaves room for Alice to come up a little if she's willing to negotiate.
* **Staying within your budget:** $8,500 is significantly lower than both your maximum price and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget:**  $9,000 is still within your acceptable range, and much better than buying from John. 
* **Compromise reached:** Alice has moved from her initial price, and you've also moved from your initial counteroffer.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not your ideal price, you could still try to negotiate further if you're really keen on getting a lower price. However, at this point, the risk of losing the deal by pushing too hard outweighs the potential savings."
