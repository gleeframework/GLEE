Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000. You'll save $4,000 and avoid further negotiation."
