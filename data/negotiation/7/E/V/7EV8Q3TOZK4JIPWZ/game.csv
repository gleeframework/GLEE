"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your understanding, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,800 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $8,600? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,700. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,700. Let's split the difference and settle on $8,650. It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal today.",8650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given you a great deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,700, and I think $8,650 is a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $8,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",8750.0,Alice,7,
