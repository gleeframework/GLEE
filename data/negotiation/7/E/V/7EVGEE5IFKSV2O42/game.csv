"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I think $13,000 is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. It's a compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
