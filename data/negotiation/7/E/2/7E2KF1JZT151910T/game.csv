"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we go to $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll make sure to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,,
