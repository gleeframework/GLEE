"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing enthusiasm and highlighting the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially secure a favorable counteroffer. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I have room to negotiate a potentially better deal with Bob in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both my minimum and my initial offer.  Accepting would be a substantial loss.  While his offer shows some interest, there's a wide gap to bridge. I'll counter-offer to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is quite a ways away from what I can agree to.  To be fair, could you consider something closer to $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to keep the negotiation collaborative, so I acknowledge his offer and perspective.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I'm lowering my price considerably to signal flexibility, but I'm still staying well above my absolute minimum of $15,000.  
* **Encouraging Movement:** By suggesting a specific number ($18,000), I'm nudging Bob to make a more significant counteroffer in the next round. 
* **John Still an Option:** While I'm aiming for a higher price with Bob, I haven't ruled out selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000 if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $18,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly inching up, but it's still far below my $15,000 minimum.  While he's expressing a willingness to negotiate, his increases are incremental. I need to signal that a more substantial jump is needed to continue the negotiation with me.  I'll reject this offer, but I'm getting closer to the point where accepting John's $15,000 offer might be the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate you moving your price up.  However,  the gap between our positions is still quite large. To make this work, I would need to see an offer closer to $16,000. Let me know if that's something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's small increases to encourage him to keep negotiating. 
* **Substantial Demand:** I'm making it very clear that his current offer range is too low and that a significant jump is needed.
* **Near Minimum:** My counteroffer is now just slightly above my minimum price.  If Bob doesn't show a willingness to move closer to this range in the next round or two, I will likely accept John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** We are over halfway through the rounds. I need to apply some pressure so Bob understands I'm willing to walk away from the table and accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I also need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now negotiating more seriously, his idea of ""halfway"" is still far below my minimum.  He's consistently shown an unwillingness to move substantially from his initial offer range.  We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident that Bob will meet my minimum in the remaining time. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
