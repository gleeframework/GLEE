"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is quite a ways away from what I can agree to.  To be fair, could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $18,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate you moving your price up.  However,  the gap between our positions is still quite large. To make this work, I would need to see an offer closer to $16,000. Let me know if that's something you can consider.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I also need to stay within a reasonable budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
