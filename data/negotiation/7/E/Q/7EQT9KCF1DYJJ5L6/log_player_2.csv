"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount on its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
