"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that you're serious about negotiating but won't accept a price anywhere near her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its real value to me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is still significantly less than Alice's asking price and your $8,000 walk-away point, it's important to start low to give yourself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  By mentioning you're interested but need a more realistic price, you show Alice you're serious about buying but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $18,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 walk-away point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's room to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:** You still have the safety net of buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your original position. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair offer, bridging the gap between our valuations."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** This counteroffer represents a $2,000 increase from your previous offer, signaling to Alice that you're willing to move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""fair offer"" that ""bridges the gap,"" you maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're still comfortably below your $8,000 walk-away price, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
