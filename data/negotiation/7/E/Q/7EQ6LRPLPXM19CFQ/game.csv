,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its real value to me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your original position. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair offer, bridging the gap between our valuations.",12000.0,Bob,4,
