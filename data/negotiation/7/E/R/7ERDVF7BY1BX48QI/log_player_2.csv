Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's offer:** Alice is now offering $887,500, which is $112,500 less than John's price.
* **The negotiation is likely to continue:**  Alice has been willing to negotiate and has already lowered her price substantially. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's uncertain.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, he risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal. 

Given these factors, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer at this point, securing a significant saving compared to John's offer."
