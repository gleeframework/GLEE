Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation.  I'm willing to continue the conversation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that would allow us to both make a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $900,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll counter Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $887,500.
