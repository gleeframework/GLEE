Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. How about we aim for $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,000, and I believe I can still negotiate with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $10,500.  This is still a fantastic price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price as I'd get from John.  So I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
