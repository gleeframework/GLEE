"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you to make a profit, and it fits within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
