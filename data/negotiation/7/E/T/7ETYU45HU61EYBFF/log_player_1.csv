Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's work together to make this happen.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to make a profit, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price point of $1,200,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you to make a profit, and it fits within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000, this offer meets my minimum price point of $1,000,000. It's important to secure a sale, and Bob's offer allows me to do that while still making a decent profit."
