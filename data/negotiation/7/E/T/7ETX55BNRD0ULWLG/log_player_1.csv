{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) leaves money on the table for you. Offering it at $1,200,000 (your valuation) or higher will likely make Bob reject the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 aims to find a sweet spot:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    * It's still attractive enough that Bob might consider it, especially if he highly values the product's uniqueness. 

This offer allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's even more favorable for you while still exceeding your guaranteed sale price to John."
