You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more money.  Bob has a clear advantage since he knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000.  By rejecting, he can try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, offering $1,050,000. This is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her minimum selling price is $1,000,000. Bob is aiming to get a good deal while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than buying from John and still a decent profit for Alice.  There's not much room for further negotiation, as Bob has already made a fairly aggressive counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal to John."
