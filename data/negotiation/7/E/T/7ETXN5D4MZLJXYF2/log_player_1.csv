Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he may be willing to pay a little more than my offer, especially if he feels the product is truly worth the higher value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above John's offer, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I think this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
