"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your starting price is a bit too high for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is closer to my budget. This offer reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
