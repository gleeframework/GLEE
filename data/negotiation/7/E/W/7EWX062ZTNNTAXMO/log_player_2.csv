"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name] for a price of $1000000. This is a significant discount from what I would receive from another buyer.  The product is worth $800000 to you, so this offers a great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is more than you're willing to pay. Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer."
