"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us in the long run.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,275,000 is still quite far from what the product is truly worth. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,325,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence in finding a solution. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to drop my price just a little more to $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1310000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but no higher. I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options, including buying from John. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
