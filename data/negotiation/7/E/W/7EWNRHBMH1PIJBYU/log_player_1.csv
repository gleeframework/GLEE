```

I'm going to sell the product to John. 

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. It's better to guarantee the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or a failed deal.  John is a reliable buyer and I'm comfortable closing the deal with him."
