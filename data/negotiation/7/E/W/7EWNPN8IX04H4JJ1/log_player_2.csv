"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for only $100. This is an exceptional opportunity considering its true value is $120. Don't miss out on this chance to get a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than John's price of $120, you know you can get the product for a maximum of $120. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of getting a better price, closer to your $80 limit."
