Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
