"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to save some money while I get a price that reflects the product's true value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
