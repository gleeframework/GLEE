Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, aiming high initially allows room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $1,500,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price."
