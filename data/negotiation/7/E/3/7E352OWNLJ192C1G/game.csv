"Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping we could discuss a price that's more aligned with my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects the value it can bring to my business, but it's more reasonable for me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget considerations. While I'd like to accommodate your needs, I must maintain a fair price for our product. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose a price of $875000 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of the product while being more flexible to your current budget. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Dear Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the value the product can bring to my business. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
