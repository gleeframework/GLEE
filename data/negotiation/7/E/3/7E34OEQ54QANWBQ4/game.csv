"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm  sticking with my offer of $1,000,000. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
