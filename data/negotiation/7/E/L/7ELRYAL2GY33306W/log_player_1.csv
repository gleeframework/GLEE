"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly message to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, his message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. It's a great deal for a product you'll love."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Range:**  My counteroffer of $100 is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows flexibility and signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring I make a profit.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** My message reinforces the value of the product and emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, and he's still interested in the product. 
* **Seeking a Better Price:** Rejecting this offer allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $95 is the midpoint between Bob's last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Acceptable Price:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Encouraging Closing:** My message emphasizes fairness and uses persuasive language like ""seal the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
