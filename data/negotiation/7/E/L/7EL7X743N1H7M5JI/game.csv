,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm facing time constraints and have another interested buyer.  If we can't reach an agreement close to $1,300,000 in this round, I'll have to explore that other option.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm serious about this purchase, but only within a reasonable price range. I can offer you $750,000 as a final offer.  If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider my other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
