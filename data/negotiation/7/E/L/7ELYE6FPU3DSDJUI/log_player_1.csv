Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer ($10,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates a bit. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup offer."
