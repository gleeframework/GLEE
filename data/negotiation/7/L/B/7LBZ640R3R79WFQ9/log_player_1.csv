Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, I believe I can get closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000 by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to drop the price to $1,600,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will only lead to a lower price. I'm confident that I can get my minimum value of $1,500,000 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
