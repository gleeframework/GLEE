"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I'm sure you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $950,000 is too far above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
