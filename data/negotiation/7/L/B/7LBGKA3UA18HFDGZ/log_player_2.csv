"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I'm sure you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice is getting further from her product's worth and closer to my maximum price. I need to stand firm or consider buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $950,000 is too far above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```tool_code
Reason: This counter offer puts us closer to the middle ground, but also sets a firm boundary with a potential walk away. This hopefully encourages Alice to accept, or at least come down significantly in her next counter.
