"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,375. I can do $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,5,
