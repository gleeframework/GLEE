Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,375. I can do $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving $3,000 compared to John's offer."
