"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This feels like a fair offer considering the product's quality and benefits.",12500.0,Alice,3,
