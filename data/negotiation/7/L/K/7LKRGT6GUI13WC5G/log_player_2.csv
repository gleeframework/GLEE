# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from what the product is worth to her ($800,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John at $1,000,000, so you have some leverage. 

Alice might come back with a lower offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
