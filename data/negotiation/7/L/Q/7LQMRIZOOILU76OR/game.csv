"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
