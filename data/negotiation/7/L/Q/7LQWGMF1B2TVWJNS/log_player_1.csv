Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, so you'd still be making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's space for him to negotiate a lower price if he wants, but still potentially leave him with a good deal. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
