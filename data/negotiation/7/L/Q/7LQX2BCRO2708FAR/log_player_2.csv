"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While $900,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice, or he can choose to buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still higher than what he was aiming for, it's a fair price considering the value of the product to him and the potential hassle of further negotiations. If he rejects, he runs the risk of Alice increasing the price again or him ultimately needing to buy from John for $800,000."
