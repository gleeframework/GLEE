Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, implying a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm open to negotiation and not immediately jumping to John's offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to sell to Bob for $850,000, it's more advantageous to:

* **Maintain bargaining power:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Explore better options:** This gives me a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not fully accepting his offer, signaling that I still have room to negotiate.
* **Reiterate the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying my counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiations moving forward."
