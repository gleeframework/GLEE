"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and highlights the product's value to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we anchor the negotiation in a favorable range. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potentially lucrative deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. After evaluating its potential value, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees significant value in the product. Rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer keeps the door open for a higher potential profit. We're not in a rush, and John's offer provides a solid backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to part with it for $1,275,000. This represents a significant investment for you, but I believe it will pay off handsomely given the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($25,000) than Bob's initial counteroffer, signaling that we're looking for a price closer to our initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's potential value to justify the higher price and maintain a strong negotiating position. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and our desired price. It keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you see in this product, but based on my analysis, I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 represents a $450,000 profit, which is a significant return.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We've both made concessions, and this offer is a fair compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, there's no guarantee of securing a better offer from Bob. Accepting now locks in a very good deal. 

By accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000, we achieve a strong balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
