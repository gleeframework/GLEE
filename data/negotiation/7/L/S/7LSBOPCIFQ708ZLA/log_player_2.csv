"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $13500.

I believe this price reflects the quality and value it brings to you. Looking forward to your response.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than Alice's desired price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I would like to propose an offer of $13000 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's budget. However, Bob can still secure the product for a lower price from John.  Since Bob's primary goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most financially advantageous option."
