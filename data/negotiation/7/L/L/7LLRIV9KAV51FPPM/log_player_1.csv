{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob since he values the product at $150. This gives you some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can reject Bob's offer. Although $100 is better than selling to John for $80, you can likely do better. You are confident the product is worth more to Bob and you can still increase your profit by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal and ensures I can make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a proposal of $105 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a fair compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $80, and it's close enough to your counteroffer of $110. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while avoiding further negotiation that might risk losing the deal entirely."
