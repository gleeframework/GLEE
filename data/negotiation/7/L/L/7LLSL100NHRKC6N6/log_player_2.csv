# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I understand its worth stands at $15,000. My goal is to maximize the return on this valuable asset while ensuring it finds a home where it can truly make a difference. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a substantial saving compared to its market value. I look forward to discussing how this product could benefit you further. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($12,000 vs. $8,000). This suggests room for negotiation. 
* While you'd be getting a discount compared to John's price, it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're a serious buyer but also price-conscious. There's a good chance she'll counter with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
