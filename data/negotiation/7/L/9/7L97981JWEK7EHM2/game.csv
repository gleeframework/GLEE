"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $132.50? That's the best I can do.",132.5,Bob,4,
