Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below John's standing offer of $120. It's worth seeing if we can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between $140 and your offer, making it $117.50?"",
""product_price"": 117.50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer!  I could maybe stretch to $100, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has hit his maximum price, which is still less than John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob.  It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
