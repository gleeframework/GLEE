"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between $140 and your offer, making it $117.50?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer!  I could maybe stretch to $100, but that's my absolute limit.",100.0,Bob,6,
