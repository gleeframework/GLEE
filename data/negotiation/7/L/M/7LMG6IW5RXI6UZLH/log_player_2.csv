"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $100. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high demand and unique features of the item. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $100, which is a good price.
* However, you can still potentially get a better deal. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can then buy from John for $120, which is still within your budget.
* This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the lowest possible price."
