Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $140? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $120 before our 10 rounds are up. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
