"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, $170 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $140? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $115? That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
