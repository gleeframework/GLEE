This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to move forward with the other buyer.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and introducing a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer. While her price is getting closer to our ideal, it's unlikely she'll budge much further, especially with a potential backup offer. Accepting her current price would mean overpaying by $25,000.  John offers a guaranteed price at our maximum budget, making it the most financially sound decision."
