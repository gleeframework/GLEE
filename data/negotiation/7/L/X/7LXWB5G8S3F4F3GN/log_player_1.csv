Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation while still positioning the product as high-value. 
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Aiming for a price of $1,150,000 gives us a good buffer while still being potentially appealing to Bob if he's willing to stretch his budget.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantially lower than both our desired price and his known valuation of the product. Accepting this would mean a loss of potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates there's room to meet somewhere in the middle. By rejecting and countering, we can aim to close the gap. 
* **Security of John:** We have the fallback option of John's offer, which guarantees us our desired minimum price. This allows us to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've significantly reduced our asking price from $1,150,000 to $1,075,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We've moved closer to Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, increasing the likelihood he'll see this as a serious offer. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** The price is still substantially above Bob's initial offer, ensuring we maintain a healthy profit margin.  We're aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $950,000? That's a substantial sum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob has increased his offer, but the change is incremental.  This suggests we might be stuck in a slow negotiation process.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round we are not exploring other opportunities or solidifying the deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and potentially even a better outcome than a drawn-out negotiation with Bob might yield.

**Next Steps:**

While rejecting Bob's offer, it's crucial to convey a sense of urgency and our potential move to another buyer. This could prompt Bob to make a more competitive offer in the next round or lead us to accept John's offer if no significant progress is made."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I need to be transparent: I have another buyer ready to close the deal at a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one final opportunity to meet a figure of $1,025,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to move forward with the other buyer."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This message communicates that this is our best and final offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The 24-hour deadline introduces a time constraint, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially make a more serious offer.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** By mentioning the other buyer (John), we signal to Bob that we have a strong alternative if he doesn't meet our requirements.  This leverages Bob's potential loss aversion. 

**Outcome:** This strategy puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can:

1. **Accept the offer:**  A win for both parties.
2. **Make a significantly improved counteroffer:** Potentially leading to a faster negotiation. 
3. **Let the offer expire:** We move forward with John's offer, securing our desired minimum price."
