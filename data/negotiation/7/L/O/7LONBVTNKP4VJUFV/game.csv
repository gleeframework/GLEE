"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $600,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, and $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $725,000?  That's a significant step from my last offer, showing I'm serious about making a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.
