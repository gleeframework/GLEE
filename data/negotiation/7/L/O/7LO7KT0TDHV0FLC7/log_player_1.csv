Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $700000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round. I still have time, and I don't want to settle for a price significantly below the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $750,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $725000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I only have 4 rounds left, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $740,000. This is a fair compromise considering we both want to reach an agreement. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 740000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $740000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $720000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've only got two rounds left and Bob is still refusing to go higher. I'm not sure if he's truly interested in the product or just trying to negotiate a really low price. With only two rounds left, I'm better off selling to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
