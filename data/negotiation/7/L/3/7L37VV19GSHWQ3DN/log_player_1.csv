"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""unique potential"" and ""true worth,"" I'm aiming to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus from just the monetary value.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, I'm signaling my willingness to discuss the price, demonstrating flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy seeks to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This represents a significant discount and is a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit, but I believe there's room to secure a higher price from Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation and offering a starting point. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by recognizing Bob's offer and thanking him for his engagement, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Firm but Flexible:** While I'm making a significant reduction from my initial offer ($250,000), I'm still holding firm well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a middle ground, encouraging Bob to make a more substantial counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a considerable price difference from my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob's offer is now above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  He increased his offer by $200,000, indicating potential for further movement. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, aiming to secure a more advantageous deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are making progress and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value it brings while recognizing your investment."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I want to acknowledge the progress made and create a collaborative atmosphere by pointing out the positive movement in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $300,000, a significant drop, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Justification:** I'm framing this price as a balance between the product's inherent value and Bob's investment, appealing to his sense of fairness.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether."
