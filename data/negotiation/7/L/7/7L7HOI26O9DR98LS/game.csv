"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
