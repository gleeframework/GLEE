"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,000,000.  There's no incentive to accept her offer because you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to consider if you can find a better deal elsewhere."
