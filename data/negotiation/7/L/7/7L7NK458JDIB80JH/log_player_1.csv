{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't sell yourself short.
* **It's not unreasonably high:** It's important to balance your desired profit with Bob's potential willingness to pay. 
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:**  Building rapport and demonstrating confidence in your product can increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's important to remember that you're trying to maximize your profit. There's a chance you can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  You're prepared to sell to John for the same amount, but it's worth exploring if you can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price if you're serious about acquiring it. How about $1,400,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price. At this point, you've already rejected his previous offers, and the negotiations are getting close to a stalemate.  While you could try another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and you'll be forced to sell to John for the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a slightly better deal than selling to John."
