"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge or might even raise her price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice might walk away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy for Bob. It saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John and secures the product within his budget."
