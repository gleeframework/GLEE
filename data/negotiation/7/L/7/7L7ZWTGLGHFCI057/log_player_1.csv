"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price of $14,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
