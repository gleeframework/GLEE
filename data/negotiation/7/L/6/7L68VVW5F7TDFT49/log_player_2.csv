"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us!  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $10,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $11000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still within Bob's budget.**  The price is $11,000, which is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **There is limited room for further negotiation.**  While Bob could try another counteroffer, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, especially since her initial offer was already a good deal for Bob compared to John's price.
* **Accepting avoids the risk of losing the deal.**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a fair price and avoids any further risk or negotiation."
