{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming for a price between those figures maximizes potential profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals the product's worth while acknowledging his valuation might be lower. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant benefits"" subtly reinforces the price point without directly stating ""it's worth this much to YOU"".

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly, but remain firm on a price that secures a substantial profit for you."
