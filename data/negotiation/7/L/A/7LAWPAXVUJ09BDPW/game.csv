"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we try $1,000,000? That's a significant investment on my end but reflects a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept that low of an offer.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself, and this is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
