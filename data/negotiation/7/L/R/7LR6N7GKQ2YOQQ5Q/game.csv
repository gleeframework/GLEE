"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $165? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least that much for the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about $140? That's a good price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $140 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer of $165. How about we try $157.50? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise.",157.5,Alice,5,
