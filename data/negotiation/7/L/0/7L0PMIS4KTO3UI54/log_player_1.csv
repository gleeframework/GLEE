# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I'm able to place on this product. Let me know what you think.
