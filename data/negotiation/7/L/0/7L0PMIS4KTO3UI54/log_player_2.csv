"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer as Bob can buy the product from John for a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob is better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal.  He can also use this opportunity to understand why Alice is so resistant to lower prices. This could give him valuable information for his next counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects the maximum value I can realistically assign to this product at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is enough for the product's value. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,300,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  It's risky to keep negotiating, especially considering Bob has a guaranteed option of buying the product from John for $1,000,000.  

Given this certainty, Bob is best off taking the safe option and purchasing the product from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further risk or uncertainty in the negotiation with Alice."
