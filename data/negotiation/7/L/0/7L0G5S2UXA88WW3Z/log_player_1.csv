Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your understanding. I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000. To be honest, my absolute top limit is $1,100,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

While getting $1,300,000 would be ideal, Bob has signaled this is his absolute limit.  It's better to accept the $1,100,000 offer now than risk him walking away and getting only $1,200,000 from John."
