"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to the right buyer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price, taking into account the market conditions and the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
