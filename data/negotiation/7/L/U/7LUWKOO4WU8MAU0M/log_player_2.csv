Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than my initial expectation, I'm willing to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the product's unique features and potential. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground.

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, and I'm starting to get the feeling she's not going to budge much further.  I'd rather avoid further negotiation and just go with John's offer. It's a bit higher than I initially hoped, but it's still within my budget and I'm confident I can get a good deal."
