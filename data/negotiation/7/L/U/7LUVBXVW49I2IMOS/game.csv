"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I really like the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot to you, so let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $109? I'm willing to compromise to make this deal happen.",109.0,Alice,5,
