"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, which I understand is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  I think that's a fair deal that allows me to benefit while still recognizing the product's worth.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $950,000? That feels like a solid compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,025,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  Let's try to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,075,000.
