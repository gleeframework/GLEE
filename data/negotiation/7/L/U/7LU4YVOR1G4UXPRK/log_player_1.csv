Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe this offer is attractive enough to encourage Bob to accept, but allows me to potentially earn more if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, but still keeps the price higher than his offer while showing I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, but if not, I'm prepared to continue the negotiation until we find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While I'm still hoping to get a better price, I'm concerned that we're getting into a back-and-forth that could drag on.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum and guarantees a sale."
