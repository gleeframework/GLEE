Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Anchoring:** Offering $120 first sets a high ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. While $80 is his actual value, he might be willing to go above that if he perceives the initial offer as a potential bargain.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
