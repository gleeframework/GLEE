Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $11,000 for the product? I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests.

You're still within your budget with Alice's offer, but it's still a bit more than you'd like to pay.  You can try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your $10,000 target."
