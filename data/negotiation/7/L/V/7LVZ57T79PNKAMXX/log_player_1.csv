Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm subtly suggesting that if Bob doesn't act, he might miss out, even though I have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects this initial offer, I have the security of John's guaranteed purchase at my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit without the risk of losing the sale entirely."
