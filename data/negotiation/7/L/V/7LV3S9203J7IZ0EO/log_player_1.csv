"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000 for this round. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price of $2,250,000 (significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value) leaves room for negotiation and anchors the discussion at a higher point.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""for this round"" implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate in subsequent rounds.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how far apart our valuations are.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, I gain significantly.
3. **Set Negotiation Ground:** Even if he rejects it, we'll have a reference point for further negotiation.

Importantly, I'm aware I have the fallback option of John, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is his perceived value of the product and significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's too early to walk away. I'll use the remaining rounds to negotiate and explore if Bob is willing to increase his offer significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product extends far beyond your initial assessment. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000 for this round. This offer reflects the true worth and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm signaling flexibility by reducing my price by $400,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, aiming to shift Bob's perception and justify a higher price. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer of $1,850,000 is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price, giving me room to negotiate further.

By gradually reducing my price while emphasizing value, I aim to guide Bob toward a more reasonable offer without conceding too much too quickly.  I'm aware that time is a factor (10 rounds), and I'll continue to evaluate my options, including the offer from John, as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, I'm still not able to go above $1,200,000 at this time. It's a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I need to signal that his offer is still too low while showing a willingness to negotiate to avoid a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,650,000.  This offer reflects a significant concession from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by another $200,000, a significant amount that shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this offer represents a compromise on my part. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By making a significant move, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to respond in kind. We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation.

I'm still above my $1,500,000 minimum and aim to meet somewhere in the middle.  Bob's responses will determine my next move, including potentially shifting tactics or considering John's offer more seriously if progress stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While he's showing more significant increases, I need to hold firm and signal that we're nearing a critical point in the negotiation.  I'll counter with an offer close to my minimum to test his flexibility and willingness to close the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing a point where we need to decide if this deal is possible. I'm willing to make a final significant move to show my commitment to working with you. My final offer is $1,450,000.  This is a considerable compromise from my original price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my ""final offer"" to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my price to $1,450,000, which is only slightly above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 
* **Justification:** I'm reminding Bob that this offer is a significant move from my initial ask, highlighting the compromise I'm making.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can choose to accept a price closer to his target, or we risk a deadlock, at which point I'll likely take John's offer to avoid wasting further time."
