Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have room to start with a significantly higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus to the perceived benefits rather than just the price tag.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy allows you to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum desired price."
