"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering how much you'll be able to benefit from it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get a better price closer to her $8,000 value."
