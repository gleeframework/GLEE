"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is my final offer, as I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900. Can you meet me there?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident in the value of my product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll be forced to consider other options.  What's your final decision?",10000.0,Alice,7,
