"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, offering this amount leaves space for me to potentially meet Alice somewhere in the middle if she's willing to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** I need to keep in mind that I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice came down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high.  I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price or I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I had in mind. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a significantly lower price.  If you're able to consider an offer closer to $10,000, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may have to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Pressure:** By mentioning that I have another option at a lower price, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to consider a more significant price reduction.
* **Slight Increase:** I increased my offer slightly to $10,000, showing Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her current offer.
* **Balance:** I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from Alice if she's unwilling to budge on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued conversation. I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I did aim for a higher price initially, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects the true value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $14,000 is her final offer. 
* **Too High:** Even with the price reduction, $14,000 is still significantly higher than my $8,000 budget and the $8,000 I can get the product for from John. 
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with, especially since she's unwilling to go lower. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
