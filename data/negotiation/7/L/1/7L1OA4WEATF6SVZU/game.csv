"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out.  $150 is a bit out of my budget for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $150 and $135. How about we try $142.50?",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $142.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $138?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",138.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $138 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between $138 and $135. How about we try $136.50?",136.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $136.50 is getting close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $135?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.",135.0,Bob,6,
