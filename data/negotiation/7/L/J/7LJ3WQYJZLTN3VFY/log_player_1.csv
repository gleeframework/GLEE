Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open the door for a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  If he rejects again, I will seriously consider selling to John."
