"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob! I'm glad you like the product. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
