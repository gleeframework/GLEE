Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and still ensures a profitable outcome.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John will buy the product at Alice's minimum price provides leverage. Alice doesn't *need* to sell to Bob, so she can afford to aim high initially.
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" framing:** This language subtly implies value and scarcity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price."
