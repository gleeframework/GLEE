"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, and he still has time to buy from John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford right now. How about $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has a few rounds left and can try to negotiate further. There's always a chance Alice will come down more, and he shouldn't be afraid to push for the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to pay $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $12,500, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make one more concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is round 7, and Bob only has three rounds left.
* **Negotiation is stalled:** Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,000, and Bob is unwilling to go higher than $12,500.
* **John's offer is safe:** Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget, eliminating any risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice. 

While Bob may be able to squeeze out a slightly better price from Alice, the risk of the deal falling through is too high with only a few rounds left. It's a smarter decision to secure the product from John."
