"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $900,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise in the next round. There's still a chance to get a better deal."

While $850,000 is close to John's offer, I'm not willing to give up so easily.  I'm still holding out hope that Bob will come closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."

At this point, Bob has essentially matched John's offer. There's very little room for further negotiation, and continuing to haggle might risk losing both buyers.  I'm going to accept John's offer and close the deal to secure a guaranteed profit."
