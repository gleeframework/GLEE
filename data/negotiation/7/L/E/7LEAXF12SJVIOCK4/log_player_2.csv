"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you a deal. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can move to negotiate a lower price or proceed with John's offer and save a considerable amount."
