"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your budget constraints, we believe the value of our product justifies a higher price. We would like to counter your offer with a price of $850,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to our initial valuation, while also reflecting the value we place on the transaction. We hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Alice,3,
