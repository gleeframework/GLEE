"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $110 is cheaper than John's $120 price, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. You're aiming for the best possible deal."
