"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
