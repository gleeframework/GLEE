"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
