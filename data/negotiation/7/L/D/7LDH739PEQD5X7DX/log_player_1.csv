"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming to capture as much of the potential profit as possible.  I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to establish a good rapport with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to assess the situation and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and hoping to persuade Bob that my offer is fair. My goal is to inch closer to my minimum price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While we're getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I still have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. How about $1,000,000?  This is my minimum price, and it still represents a significant value for you. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This time, I'm making a firm offer at my minimum price. I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get for the product and appealing to his desire to close the deal.  This is a crucial point in the negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're down to the wire with only 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to budge any further.  It's not worth the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer."
