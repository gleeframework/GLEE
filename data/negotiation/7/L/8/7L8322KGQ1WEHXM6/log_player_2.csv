"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice and $120 to you. Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?

While Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's price, you can still try to negotiate further. You've shown you're willing to pay up to $105, and Alice has shown flexibility.  A counteroffer might get you a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
