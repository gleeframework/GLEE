Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $11500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Bob has offered $11,500. I can do better, so I'll reject the offer and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about $12,500? That's still a great value for you, and it gives us both a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I can get from John.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
