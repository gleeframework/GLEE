"Alice, your initial offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $850,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
