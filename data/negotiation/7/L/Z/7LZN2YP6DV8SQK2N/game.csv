"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,400?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",10400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go up to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $10,600. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",10600.0,Alice,5,
