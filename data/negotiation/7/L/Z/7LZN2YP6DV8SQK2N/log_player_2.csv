"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. It's above his target price of $12,000. He can try to negotiate with Alice and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $12,000 limit. Bob should reject and try to negotiate further. He has time and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,400?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go up to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $10,600. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he's received so far and it's still within his budget of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
