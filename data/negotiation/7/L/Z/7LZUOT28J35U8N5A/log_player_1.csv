This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's perceived value of the product.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
