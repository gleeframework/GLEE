"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can aim for a better deal.  He has a maximum budget of $150, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $122.50 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. He has a few more rounds to work with, and he doesn't want to give up on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $120? This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your asking price and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}
