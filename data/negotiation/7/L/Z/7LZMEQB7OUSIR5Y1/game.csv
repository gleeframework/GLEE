"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? This would give us both a good deal.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $120? This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your asking price and within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
