Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.  If Bob is genuinely interested, I hope this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and I believe $125 is a fair price.  Continuing to counter-offer might risk losing the sale altogether."
