"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The initial offer from Alice is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move that will likely force Alice to reconsider her price. I'm aiming to establish a lower baseline for negotiations while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also considering that Alice might be willing to go lower to secure a deal, as she rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe there's still room for a better price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're nearing the middle ground and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer at $625,000 is still a good deal, saving me a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  There's always a risk that Alice might counter with a higher price again, but the potential for a worse deal outweighs the potential for a slightly better one with the limited rounds remaining."
