"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll see what John has to offer.
