{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 8 with only 2 rounds remaining. Bob's offer of $10,700 is getting closer, but it's still below my ideal price.  I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a better price in the next two rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe bet, and guarantees me a decent profit."
