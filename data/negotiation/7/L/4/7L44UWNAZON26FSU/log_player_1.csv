"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant amount for Bob, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good return on my investment. I'm confident that with 10 rounds, we can arrive at a mutually agreeable price.  However, if Bob isn't willing to budge, I can always go with John's offer for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a fair offer that leaves room for both of us to be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is still slightly lower than I'd like, it's a good offer considering the limited rounds remaining.  I'm  accepting Bob's offer. It's a good outcome, considering the risk of continuing negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is only $80,000 higher."
