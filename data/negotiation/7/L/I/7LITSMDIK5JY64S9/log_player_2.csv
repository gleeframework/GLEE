Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, but I still think $750,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'm willing to meet Alice halfway between $750,000 and $950,000, which would be $850,000.

{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers. It's a great price for a product that will bring you significant returns.
