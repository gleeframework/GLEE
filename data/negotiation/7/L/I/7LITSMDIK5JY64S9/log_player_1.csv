"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to your endeavors. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting at my minimum ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially secure a deal closer to my asking price. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and provides a strong starting point for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is always an option, I still have ample rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is considerably below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I lowered my price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  By reiterating the product's inherent value, I aim to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception.

This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a couple more rounds to see if I can get closer to $900,000.  If Bob doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers. It's a great price for a product that will bring you significant returns."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession, Firm Stance:** I decreased my price by $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise, but I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning other interested buyers (even if hypothetical) might incentivize Bob to act quickly and accept this offer.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage Bob to make a decision this round.

I'm balancing getting closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my $900,000 target. If he rejects this, I'll likely take John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob hasn't budged from his $850,000 offer, even after I presented my ""final offer"" and introduced the idea of competition. It's unlikely he'll go higher. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
