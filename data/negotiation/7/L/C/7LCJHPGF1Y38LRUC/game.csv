"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This still gives you a great value and ensures I get a fair price. ",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground.  While I appreciate you coming up to $8,800, I'm really not willing to go lower than $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for well below what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,900.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
