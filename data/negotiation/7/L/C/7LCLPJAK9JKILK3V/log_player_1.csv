Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $150, but John guarantees that price.

Offering the product at $140 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob gets a $20 gain ($140 price - $120 value).
* **Your Profit:** You make a $10 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
