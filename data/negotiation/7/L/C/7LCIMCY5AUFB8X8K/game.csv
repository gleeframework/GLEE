"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand the product's value may seem a bit high at first glance, but I assure you it's worth the investment.  How about we settle on $17,000? That's a significant price drop and a fair offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
