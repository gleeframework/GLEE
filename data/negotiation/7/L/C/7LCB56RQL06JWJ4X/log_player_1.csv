Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a sense of the value I place on the product. 

The strategy here is to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A high starting price gives the best chance of getting a price closer to my ideal.
* **Allow for negotiation:** The offer isn't unreasonable, leaving room for Bob to counter.
* **Set a clear baseline:**  The price establishes my starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, there's no reason to settle immediately.  

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob clearly values the product, but may be willing to pay more. 
* **Gaining information:** Rejecting allows me to see if Bob is truly willing to walk away, or if he's just testing the waters. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** A counteroffer gives me control and the opportunity to steer the negotiation.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This allows me to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm willing to compromise, which can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This prevents the deal from stalling. 

By playing it strategically, I can increase the likelihood of getting a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

My counteroffer of $1,400,000 reflects a compromise, showing Bob that I am willing to negotiate. 

Here's the thinking behind this counteroffer:

* **Reasonable compromise:** It's significantly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable price point.
* **Testing the waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's true interest and how much he's willing to pay.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counteroffer keeps control of the negotiation in my hands. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to come back with a higher offer or at least push him to accept my price. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer, but I believe I can secure a more favorable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested in the product. A few more rounds of negotiation could yield a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I keep control and can counter with a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  A quick acceptance now might leave money on the table, especially if Bob is willing to go higher.

My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current price, keeping the negotiation moving. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's worth the effort to try and squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

My counteroffer of $1,350,000 keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating my willingness to compromise.

Here's the strategy behind this offer:

* **Strategic compromise:** It's lower than my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's latest proposal. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true negotiation range. Is he willing to go higher?
* **Maintaining momentum:** It keeps the negotiation active and prevents the deal from stagnating.

While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to raise his offer or accept my price, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **The price is close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer more, $1,300,000 is only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it's unclear if there's much more room for negotiation.  
* **Time and risk:**  The longer we negotiate, the more time I'm losing.  There's a risk that Bob might lose interest, or a better opportunity might arise for me with John.

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to be realistic. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and allows me to move on. I can always use this experience to improve my negotiating strategies in the future."
