"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This gives you a great price, while still allowing me to get closer to my desired value. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,275,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. Let's split the difference again. I'm offering $1,312,500.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,306,250?",1306250.0,Bob,6,
