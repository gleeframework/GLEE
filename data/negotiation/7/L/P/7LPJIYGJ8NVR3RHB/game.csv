"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,750. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.
