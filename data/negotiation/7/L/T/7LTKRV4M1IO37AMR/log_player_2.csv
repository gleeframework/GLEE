"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and Alice is offering it at $100, there's no immediate gain in accepting her offer.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or getting a better deal from another seller."
