{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value, mentioning ""its value"" hints that the price is not arbitrary. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Bob doesn't need to know about John yet. Revealing you have a guaranteed buyer might weaken your position. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will reveal if he's willing to pay above the $12,000 or try to negotiate down.
2. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts, you earn more. If he negotiates, you have room to reduce the price while still staying above your minimum.
3. **Maintain a strong position:**  You haven't shown all your cards yet, keeping you in control of the negotiation."
