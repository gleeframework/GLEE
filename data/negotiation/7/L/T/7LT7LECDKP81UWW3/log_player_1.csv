With only three rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I'm not confident that I'll be able to reach an agreement with Bob before the rounds run out. Selling to John guarantees me the highest price, so I'm going to choose that option."
