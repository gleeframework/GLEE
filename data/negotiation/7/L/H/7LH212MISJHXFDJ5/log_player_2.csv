"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $85? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $80? That's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to her own value for the product ($80). 
* It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her walking away, forcing you to buy from John for $100.
* Accepting at $80 secures you the best possible price."
