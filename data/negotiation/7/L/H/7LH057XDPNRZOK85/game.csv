"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we do $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $13,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
