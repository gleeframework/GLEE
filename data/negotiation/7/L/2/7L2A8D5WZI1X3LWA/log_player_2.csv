"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is closer to your maximum value, it's still not ideal. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation to potentially get a price closer to your $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 90}

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to your desired price, and signals that you're serious about purchasing the product if Alice is willing to compromise."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to your maximum value, it's still not ideal. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of getting a better price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're willing to meet halfway, but are still firm on your maximum price.  It also signals that you're getting closer to your goal and may be willing to close the deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is close to your maximum price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds remaining and you can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
