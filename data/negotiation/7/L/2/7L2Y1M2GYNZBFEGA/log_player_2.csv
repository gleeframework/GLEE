"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. 

There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate down to a price closer to her own valuation of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me and your desired selling price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $13,500 is a good compromise, saving Bob $500 compared to John's price and leaving Alice with a decent profit above her valuation.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject and stick with her current offer, forcing Bob to either pay more or buy from John.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
