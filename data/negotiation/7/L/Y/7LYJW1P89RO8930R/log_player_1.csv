{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $115 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($20) while still ensuring the price is attractive enough for Bob to accept. 
* **Backup Offer:** If Bob rejects, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
