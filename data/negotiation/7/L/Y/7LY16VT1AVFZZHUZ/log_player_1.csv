Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.  I'm willing to push a bit further since Bob seems genuinely interested."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still hesitant at $1,800,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and aligns with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** $1,600,000 is a strong offer and exceeds my minimum price by $100,000. While I could try to push for more, it's getting riskier. Bob is clearly engaged, and this price ensures a profitable deal without the risk of losing him as a buyer."
