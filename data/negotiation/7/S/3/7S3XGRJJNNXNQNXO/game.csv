"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you're asking is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a good price, but I'm still not sure I can meet you there. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  To be honest, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
