"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. How about $13000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $13500? This is a fair compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I really want to make this deal work.  To be fair, and to get this done, I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $12200? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12200.0,Bob,8,
