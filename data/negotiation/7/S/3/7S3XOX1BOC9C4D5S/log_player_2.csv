"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to share the value with you. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. Would you consider purchasing it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above your maximum price point.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you wanting to share the value, but $110 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which would still be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussion, how about we aim for a price closer to $105? This would still allow us to share some of the value while keeping it reasonable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or ending up paying the full $120 to John. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
