"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to share the value with you. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. Would you consider purchasing it for $110?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you wanting to share the value, but $110 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which would still be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussion, how about we aim for a price closer to $105? This would still allow us to share some of the value while keeping it reasonable for you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
