"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open. By starting high, I leave room for negotiation, but I'm also setting a strong starting point.  I'll be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I'm also aware of John's offer, which provides me with a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I have several rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm also aware of John's offer of $12,000, which provides me with a safety net. I'll be strategic with my counteroffers to maximize my chances of getting a good deal, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $10,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer but represents a significant compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and positioning my counteroffer as a win-win situation. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm taking a step towards Bob's offer but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not willing to settle for too little.  I'm also keeping the communication positive and focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, I'm not yet ready to accept it. 

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I have several rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can achieve a better outcome.  However, I'm also aware of John's offer of $12,000, which gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer!  $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while remaining firm in my negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a final negotiation point that is within a reasonable range of both our expectations. By offering a price in the middle, I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't budge significantly. John's offer still provides me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $9,900?  That's the best I can offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,900 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offers, it's still lower than I'd like to sell for. I have several rounds left and still believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm aware that John is willing to buy the product for $12,000, so I have a strong safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through. I will focus on finding a price that is fair to both of us while ensuring that I earn a satisfactory profit."
