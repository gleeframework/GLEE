"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the significant value this product brings, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
