"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is impressive, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go.  If that's agreeable to you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
