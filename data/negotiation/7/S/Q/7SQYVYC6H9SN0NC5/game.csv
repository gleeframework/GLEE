"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
