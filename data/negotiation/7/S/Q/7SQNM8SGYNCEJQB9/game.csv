"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal considering its potential value.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects that more accurately.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's meet halfway.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
