Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This ensures that even if Bob negotiates a bit, you're still likely to get a better price than John's standing offer of $80."
