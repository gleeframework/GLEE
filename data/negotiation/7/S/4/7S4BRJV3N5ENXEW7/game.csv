"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This is a generous offer, so let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $11,000?  That's about as high as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go.",15000.0,Alice,5,
