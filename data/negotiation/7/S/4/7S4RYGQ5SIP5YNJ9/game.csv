"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've put into the product and the potential benefits it can bring to you. I hope you'll consider this offer and let's finalize the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
