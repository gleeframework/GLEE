"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong anchor price well above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and makes us appear less desperate to sell quickly.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the product in a way that justifies the high price, even if Bob doesn't fully see it yet. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing,"" we signal that we're open to discussion and counteroffers.

**Important Note:**  While we have the John backup offer, revealing it would weaken our negotiating position. We want Bob to engage without feeling like there's no pressure on our side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $2,300,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. There's still room to negotiate and aim for a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, I believe the product's value exceeds your current offer.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise while acknowledging the product's true potential."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still significantly above Bob's offer, aiming to keep the negotiation closer to our target price range.
* **Value Emphasis:** We continue to emphasize the product's ""true potential"" to subtly nudge Bob's perception of its worth upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. However, his current offer is still below your guaranteed sale price with John. We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,850,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're aiming for a compromise by roughly splitting the difference between the previous offers ($2,000,000 and $1,400,000). 
* **Highlighting Concession:**  By stating it's a ""significant reduction,"" we emphasize our willingness to be flexible and incentivize Bob to meet us closer to our price.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  We're presenting this price as a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to view it positively and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's offer now matches your guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **""Maximum"" Statement:** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to go any higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a higher price risks losing Bob and settling for the same amount with John. Accepting now secures the known good outcome."
