"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer is quite far from my valuation.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This reflects the true value of the product.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents real value, but so does staying within my budget.  To be frank, $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,537,500?",1537500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that.  While $1,537,500 is closer to the mark, I can't accept that price.  Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to go down to $1,725,000. This is my final offer.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,725,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to $1,500,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,612,500?",1612500.0,Bob,6,
