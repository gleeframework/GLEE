"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to introduce you to this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1500000 for this exceptional item. Is this something you'd like to discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This aligns with my maximum purchasing power and allows for potential negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product and willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee of getting a better deal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget."
