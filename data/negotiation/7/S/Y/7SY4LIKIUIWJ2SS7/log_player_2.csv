"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than the $12,000 you'd pay to John.  While you'd save more money by getting it for closer to Alice's value of $10,000, this offer still allows you to save $500 compared to John's price."
