Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,250,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive a later offer as a ""deal"" even if it's still above his initial valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation. While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, starting a dialogue that can lead to a mutually beneficial deal.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob is turned off by the initial high price, he might walk away. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you're not risking losing the entire sale."
