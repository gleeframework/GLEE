Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm confident I can secure a better price with further negotiation.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, which would guarantee my desired price, but I'll continue negotiations with Bob for a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $13,250, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. This gives you a good deal and allows me to avoid selling to John for a slightly lower price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
