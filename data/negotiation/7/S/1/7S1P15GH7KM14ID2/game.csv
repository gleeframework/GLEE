"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $775,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Could you consider coming down to $700,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $725,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. $725,000 is getting close, but to be honest, I need to be at $710,000 to make this work. Do you think there's any way we can make that happen?",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'll offer you the product for $720,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",720000.0,Alice,7,
