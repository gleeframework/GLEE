It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $720,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Downside of Continuing:** While we might be able to push Alice a tiny bit further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of her walking away. If that happens, we're stuck with John's much higher price. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal."
