"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $95. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really hoping to keep it under $90. Would you consider $88?  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $92. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping to close this deal, but $92 is still a bit above my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $90, we can finalize this purchase.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,6,
