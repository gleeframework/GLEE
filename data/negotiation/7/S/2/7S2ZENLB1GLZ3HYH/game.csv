"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still a bit over my budget at $95. I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $91, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",91.0,Bob,6,
