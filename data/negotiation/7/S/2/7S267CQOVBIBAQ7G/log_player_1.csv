Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
