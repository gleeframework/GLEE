"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500?  That's still a great price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
