,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value you place on the product, which is $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. My counteroffer is $11000, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
