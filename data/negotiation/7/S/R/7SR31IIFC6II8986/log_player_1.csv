Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this offer is strategic:

* **Maximizes Profit:** We're aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize your profit. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Exceeds Your Minimum:**  The $140 price ensures you'll make more than selling to John ($120) if Bob accepts."
