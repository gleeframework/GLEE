Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer is a bit higher than what you'd get from John, giving Bob a small incentive to buy. However, it's also significantly lower than the value the product holds for him, potentially leading to a deal.  This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the possibility of securing a higher profit than selling to John."
