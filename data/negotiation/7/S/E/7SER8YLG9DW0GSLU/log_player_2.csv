"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While buying from John for $80 is an option, it's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price, and you could potentially save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating.  $70 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  Accepting the offer at $75 saves me $5 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal entirely.  It's a good balance of saving money and ensuring a deal."
