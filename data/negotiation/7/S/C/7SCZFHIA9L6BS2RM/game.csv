"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand you're looking for a lower price, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, and I'm willing to throw in some additional considerations to sweeten the deal. Can you reconsider and meet me at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
