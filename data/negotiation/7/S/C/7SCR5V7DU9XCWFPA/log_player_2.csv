"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $9,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than the price John is offering, and it's closer to Bob's desired price range.  There's a good chance that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price is not worth the gamble.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking a worse outcome."
