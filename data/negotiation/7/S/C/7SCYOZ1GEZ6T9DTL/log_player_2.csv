Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. I am proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique value it holds for you based on your requirements. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
