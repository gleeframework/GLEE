Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $110? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $100.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
