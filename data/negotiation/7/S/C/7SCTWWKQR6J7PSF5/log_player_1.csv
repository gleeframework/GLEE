"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a significant discount for Bob, leaving him with a profit margin of $10. I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room for me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still far below my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It gives Bob a better deal than my initial offer, while still leaving me with a profit margin that's better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is better than selling to John for $100. We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
