Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This information is crucial for setting your initial offer.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming to maximize your profit.  Even if Bob negotiates you down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, who's ready to buy at your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This knowledge empowers you to confidently stand firm if Bob doesn't meet a price that works for you. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's perceived $10,000, potentially influencing his decision-making."
