Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price of $16,000, which is significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific about its features. This creates a sense of intrigue and encourages Bob to engage further.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate.  

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I am prepared to negotiate down towards $12,000. However, I want to explore the possibility of securing a higher price first."
