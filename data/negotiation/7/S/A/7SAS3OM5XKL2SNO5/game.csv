"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'd like to know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the product's unique features. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the price you initially offered. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you reconsider your price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go back to my initial offer of $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $1200000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
