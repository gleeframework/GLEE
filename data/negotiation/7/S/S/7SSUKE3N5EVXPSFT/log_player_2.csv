"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested, but if you decide to pass, I've already got another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, and you're aiming to spend no more than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John as your backup option."
