"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's also the possibility that Alice might be more flexible than she initially stated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While the product is of interest, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Would you be open to that? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit closer to my desired price point but still leaves room for negotiation. I've used a friendly tone and acknowledged Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a significant improvement from her initial offer. This price is within my budget and very close to my desired price point. It's a good deal considering the value of the product and my other option to buy from John for $10,000.  It's best to accept this offer before the negotiation drags on further."
