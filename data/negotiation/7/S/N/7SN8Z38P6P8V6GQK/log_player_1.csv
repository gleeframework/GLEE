``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for bargaining.  It also highlights the value to Bob.  This will hopefully encourage him to counteroffer and begin a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not going to accept it.  It's worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering your value for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $6,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

While $6,500 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer again to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 8000}
