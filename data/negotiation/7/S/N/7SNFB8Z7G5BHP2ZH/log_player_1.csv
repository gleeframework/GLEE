Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and willingness to negotiate. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the value it offers but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer $700,000; I believe this reflects a fair price considering the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below our minimum and John's guaranteed offer. We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000?  This price acknowledges the value you see while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. To make this work, I can increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe it's a fair deal given my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached his maximum offer, which is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. There's no point in further negotiation. Accepting John's offer ensures we get a fair price without further risk or delay."
