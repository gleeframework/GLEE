"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the value proposition further.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and willingness to negotiate. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the value it offers but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer $700,000; I believe this reflects a fair price considering the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000?  This price acknowledges the value you see while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. To make this work, I can increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe it's a fair deal given my budget. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
