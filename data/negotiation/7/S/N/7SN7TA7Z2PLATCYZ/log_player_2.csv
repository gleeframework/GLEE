"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

Let's start with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a decent price for me, and it gives us some room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate a better price.  Let's see if we can get a little closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'll offer $9,500. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, and hopefully, it's a price point Alice might be willing to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price limit. At this point, it makes sense to accept the offer and avoid any potential risk of further negotiation.  If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I could end up paying $10,000 for the product from John anyway.  $10,500 is a reasonable price, and I'd rather secure the product now."
