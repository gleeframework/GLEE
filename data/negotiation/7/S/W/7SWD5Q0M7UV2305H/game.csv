"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its true worth.  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings, and it allows me to secure a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to your business.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
