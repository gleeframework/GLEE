"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a lower price. You have room to negotiate, and potentially get the product for less than $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still above your preferred maximum. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get the product for a price closer to your target.  Rejecting allows you to attempt to get closer to your $1,000,000 goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate!  I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $1,000,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to purchase the product within my limit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make one more offer to try to find a compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being stubborn and only willing to come down a small amount, it's not enough to get to your desired price. You have a solid alternative with John offering the product for $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might cost you more time and still result in a higher price than John's offer."
