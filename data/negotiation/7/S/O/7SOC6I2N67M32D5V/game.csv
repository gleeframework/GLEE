"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have a bottom line, Alice, and I respect that.  How about we try $12,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it would be beneficial for both of us to close the deal now.",12000.0,Bob,6,
