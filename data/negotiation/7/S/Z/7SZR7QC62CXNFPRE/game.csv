"Hey Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $15,000.  What do you think about that?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $20,000 might have been a tad optimistic. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,250? That feels like a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16250.0,Bob,4,
