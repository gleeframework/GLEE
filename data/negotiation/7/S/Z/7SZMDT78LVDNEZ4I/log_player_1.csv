"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly hinting at the product's value to Bob, even though I don't know the specifics. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $110 price point allows for some back and forth without immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum price of $100. I'm not willing to sell for that price.
* **Negotiation Space:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $100 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob to encourage him to see the value in the product. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (being closer to my desired price) to make it seem more logical. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum price of $100.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  I've already made two concessions. It's unlikely that Bob will come up to my desired price, and further negotiation might waste time.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. 

At this point, it's more efficient to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
