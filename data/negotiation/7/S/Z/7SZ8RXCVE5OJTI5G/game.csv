"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Would you be open to that?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, so I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $8,000.  Would you consider $8,200?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're pushing hard for a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $8,300, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8300.0,Alice,5,
