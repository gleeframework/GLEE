"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. My price is $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $115, which is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and open the conversation in a positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's sticking to $105, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell the product, and I know that John is waiting in the wings to buy it for $120.  I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $105, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference.  How about $107.50? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $107.50. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my asking price with Bob, I've reached a point where I don't think I can get a better offer from him.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
