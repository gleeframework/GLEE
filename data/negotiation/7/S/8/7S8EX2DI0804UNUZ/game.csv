,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $105, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference.  How about $107.50? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $107.50. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer.",105.0,Bob,6,
