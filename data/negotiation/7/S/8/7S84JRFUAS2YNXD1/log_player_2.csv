We're still in a good position to negotiate.  Alice is coming down in smaller increments, suggesting we're getting closer to her lower limit. I'll try to nudge it down further."

Alice is really trying to hold that $10,000 line. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window, and I think we can push her just a little bit further."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I've been considering your offer carefully.  To be honest, $10,000 is about the most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is firm but fair.  We're sticking to our budget and sending a clear signal that this is our limit.
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning we're ""ready to close the deal today,"" we add a bit of time pressure, encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Leaving Room for John:** There's still a slight chance Alice won't budge. We're prepared to walk away and go with John if needed."
