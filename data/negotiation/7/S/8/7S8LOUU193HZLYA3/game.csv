"I'm sorry, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to pay any more than $10750. I think we've gone back and forth enough, and I'm going to have to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to go talk to John and see if he's willing to sell the product to me for $10000. If not, I'll come back to you and we can discuss further.",10750.0,Bob,10,
