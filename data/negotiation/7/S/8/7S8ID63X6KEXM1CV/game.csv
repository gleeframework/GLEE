"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
