Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($100) as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $80 gives you a starting point. Offering a price slightly above this might entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that.

By offering the product at $95, you are:

1. **Above Bob's Valuation:** Making it potentially attractive to him if he sees enough value.
2. **Below Your Guaranteed Sale:** Still ensuring a profit if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario of Bob accepting and you maximizing your profit."
