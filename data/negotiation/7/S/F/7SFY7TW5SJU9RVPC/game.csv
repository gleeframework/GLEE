"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a very fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 is too far below its true value.  Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
