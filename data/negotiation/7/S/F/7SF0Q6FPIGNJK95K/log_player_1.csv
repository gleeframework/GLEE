Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value ($80).
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""special price"" to make the offer more enticing. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information about Bob, you might choose a different starting price or message."
