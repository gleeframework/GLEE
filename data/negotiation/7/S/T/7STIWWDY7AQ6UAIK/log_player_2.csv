"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, there is no financial benefit to accepting either offer. You might as well reject Alice's offer and then buy from John, as it achieves the same outcome."
