"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's well below my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's much closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while still being significantly below your initial price.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
