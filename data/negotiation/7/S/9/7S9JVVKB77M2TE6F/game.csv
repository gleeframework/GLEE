"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
