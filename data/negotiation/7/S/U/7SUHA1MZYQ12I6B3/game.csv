"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make sure you're getting a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering $9750.  This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,7,
