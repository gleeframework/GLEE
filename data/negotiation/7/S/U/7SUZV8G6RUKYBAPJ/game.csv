"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $95. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little above my budget though.  How about $92? This is my final offer, and if we can't make it work, I'll have to go with another option.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $92 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $94. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",94.0,Alice,5,
