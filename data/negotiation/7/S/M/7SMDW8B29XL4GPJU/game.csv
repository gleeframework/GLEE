"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? That seems like a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,,
