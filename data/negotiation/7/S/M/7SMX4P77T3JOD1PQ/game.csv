"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.
