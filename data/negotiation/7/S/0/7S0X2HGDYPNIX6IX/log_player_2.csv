"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering. Since you're willing to pay up to $150, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is closer to your desired price, you're still willing to pay less.  There's still some room to negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $92 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $88? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $95. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering the product for $90.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the effort.** You've already gone back and forth a few times, and continuing to haggle might only waste time. 
* **The price is a good deal.** You're saving $60 compared to buying from John. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting the offer at $90 is a good compromise and ensures you get the product at a price you're happy with."
