"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $92.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $92 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $88? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $95. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
