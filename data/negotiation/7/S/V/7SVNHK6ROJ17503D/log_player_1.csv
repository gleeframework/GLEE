Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still staying within a range that's very profitable for you. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message strikes a balance between confidence in the product's value and avoiding an unreasonably high price that might scare Bob away without a counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have crucial information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond the provided context."
