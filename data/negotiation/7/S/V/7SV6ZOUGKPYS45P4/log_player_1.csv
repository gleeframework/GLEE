"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum.  This allows for negotiation while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price point. I will try to negotiate a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $11,250.  This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that is still above my minimum while making a concession to Bob's offer. This could potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10750 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I will continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,750 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm sticking to a price above my minimum, but showing flexibility by offering a small reduction. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10875.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm not ready to sell for anything less than $11,000, so I will counteroffer again.  However, with only 4 rounds left, I need to consider the risk of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm not sure if we can reach an agreement at this point. If you're not willing to go any higher, I might need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm trying to apply some pressure by suggesting that I might have to move on to John. The goal is to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer or come up with a more appealing offer, as the deal is getting risky with fewer rounds remaining."
