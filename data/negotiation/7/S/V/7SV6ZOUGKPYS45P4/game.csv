"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $11250.  This would be a win-win for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10750 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you with a reasonable profit.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10750 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10875.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you think?",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. I'm willing to come down to $11000, but I'm not sure if we can reach an agreement at this point. If you're not willing to go any higher, I might need to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
