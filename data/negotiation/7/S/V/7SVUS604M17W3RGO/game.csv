"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that could bring significant returns for your business. I'm confident this price is fair, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still provides a fair return for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to make a profit while still closing the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is simply not enough for me to make this deal work. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $890,000 for the product.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's finalize this and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
