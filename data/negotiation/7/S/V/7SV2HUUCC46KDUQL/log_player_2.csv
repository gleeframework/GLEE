"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. Would you consider purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, even if it means risking a deal with Alice.  There's a chance she'll accept a lower counteroffer, and even if she doesn't, you can still buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial solution. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to offer the product for $140. I hope this price aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is still within my budget and a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept this offer than to risk another round of negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Alice altogether.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm not sure I'd be able to get a better price, and I risk ending up buying from John at $150."
