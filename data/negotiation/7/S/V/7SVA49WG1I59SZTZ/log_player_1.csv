"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This is to encourage negotiation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $13,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there at $13,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $13,250 is above my minimum price of $12,000 and a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds.  It's also a better deal than selling to John for $12,000."
