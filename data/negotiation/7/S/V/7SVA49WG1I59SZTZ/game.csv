"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
