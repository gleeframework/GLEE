Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $20,000? "", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I still believe the product has more value and I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's try to find some common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $14,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $14,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $14200.  If we can meet in the middle there, I think we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my target of $15,000, $14,200 is a good price, and it's likely we're close to a deal. There's a risk if I reject his offer and we go through more rounds of negotiation, I might not be able to reach a higher price. I'd rather secure the deal now and avoid the possibility of losing out on a sale."
