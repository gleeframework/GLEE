"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $20000? ",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. ",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's try to find some common ground here.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $14000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $14500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $14200.  If we can meet in the middle there, I think we can close this deal.",14200.0,Bob,6,
