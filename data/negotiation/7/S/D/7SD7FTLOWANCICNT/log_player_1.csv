Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer of $7,500 to Bob. This is a reasonable price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him, and I'm trying to make a profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is $7,000, which is lower than my initial offer of $7,500. However, it's still a decent price, and I'm not willing to go below $7,200.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer of $7,200. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer of $7,150. This is a slight increase from my previous offer of $7,200, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 7150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is $6,800, which is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I've already rejected offers of $7,000 and $7,150, and I'm not going to start selling for less than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a new counteroffer of $7,100. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at a price that's closer to my minimum.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,600.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is $6,600, which is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I've already rejected offers of $7,000, $7,150, and $7,100, and I'm not going to start selling for less than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and decide to sell the product to John for $8,000. I've had enough of negotiating with Bob, and I'm willing to take the guaranteed sale to John.
