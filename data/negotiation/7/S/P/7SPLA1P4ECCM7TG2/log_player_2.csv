You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming for a price closer to $80, and $100 is too high.  The next round will give you a chance to make a counteroffer."

While $95 is closer to your goal, it's still a bit high. You have more rounds to negotiate. Rejecting this offer will give you the opportunity to try a counteroffer closer to your ideal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $90?  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn, and the price is still too high for you. You've already been through 4 rounds of negotiation, and the offer is not getting any closer to your ideal price.  It's time to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $80."
