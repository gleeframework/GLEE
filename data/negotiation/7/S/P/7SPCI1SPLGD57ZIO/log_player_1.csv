Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $80. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get a little more, $80 is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. It's important to know when to take a reasonable offer."
