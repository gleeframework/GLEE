"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows us to see if Alice will counter with a price closer to our $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while also staying within our budget. We're aiming for a price that's attractive to Alice while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to our target, we can likely still get a better price. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we have several rounds left. By rejecting this offer, we keep the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're proposing a price that's halfway between our last offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that we're serious about finding a compromise and getting a deal done. The middle ground is often a good starting point for reaching an agreement."
