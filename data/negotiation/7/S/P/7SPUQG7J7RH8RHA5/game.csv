"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your offer carefully. While I understand the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price closer to what I feel is fair. How about $800000? I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $800000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
