"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will be well worth it for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant price reduction, but I'm confident you'll find the value of the product justifies this investment.  Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $875,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a little below where I need to be.  I'm prepared to come down to $912,500. This compromise reflects the value the product brings and offers us a chance to finalize this deal.  Let's work together to find common ground.",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $912,500, but I'm willing to try. I'll meet you halfway between $900,000 and $912,500, which is $906,250. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",906250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $906,250 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $910,000. This is a small step, but it brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",910000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $900,000. I've made a significant concession already, and I believe this is a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,10,
