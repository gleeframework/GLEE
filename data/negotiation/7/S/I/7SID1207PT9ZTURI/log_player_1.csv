"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll also see how Bob reacts to my message and adjust my strategy in the next round accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? This would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is now within my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
