Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can start significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Markup:** A 50% markup (offering it at $2,250,000) aims to capture a significant portion of the product's value to Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price confidently, aiming to influence Bob's perception of its worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is. A very high offer might make him walk away without attempting to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This initial offer is just the first step.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
