Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** I want to maximize my profit, while still keeping Bob interested.
* **Logic:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John. This means I can aim for a price close to Bob's valuation, knowing I can still secure a good deal with John if Bob declines.
* **Offer:**  By offering $1,400,000, I am giving Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for myself. This price is likely attractive enough for Bob to accept, given his valuation, but also allows me to walk away with a good deal if he rejects."
