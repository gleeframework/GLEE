"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point. You have room to negotiate and potentially get the product for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $10000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is within your budget and a decent compromise.  While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of her, there's a risk of losing the deal completely. It's a good deal for both of you, and it saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John."
