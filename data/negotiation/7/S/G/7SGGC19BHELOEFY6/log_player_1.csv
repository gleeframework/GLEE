Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000).** This makes it appealing to him and encourages him to negotiate. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You can likely do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
