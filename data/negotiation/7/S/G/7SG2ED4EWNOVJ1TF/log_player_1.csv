Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely need at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, you have leverage. You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but low enough that he might see it as a reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It positions the product as valuable and suggests you have other buyers (which is true, even if it's just John). The ""limited-time"" aspect adds a bit of pressure.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a starting point for negotiation. It's:
    * Above Bob's value by $150,000.
    * Below your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this initial price, you can gauge his seriousness and potentially lower it slightly. However, never go below your $1,500,000 minimum, as you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
