"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with your backup option and save a significant amount of money."
