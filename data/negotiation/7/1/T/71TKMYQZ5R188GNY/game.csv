"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is closer to your valuation and allows for a more agreeable price for me.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
