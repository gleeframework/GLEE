# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Let me know if that works for you.

Alice is starting at a reasonable price, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if I can get a slightly better deal before accepting."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,000? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still willing to push a bit further. I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and $10,750 is a good price.  It's not worth the risk of her going up to $11,000 again or  losing the deal altogether by pushing further."
