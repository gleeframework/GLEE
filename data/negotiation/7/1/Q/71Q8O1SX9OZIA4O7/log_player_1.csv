This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also leaves a healthy margin for Bob, making the offer attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
