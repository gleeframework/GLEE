"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,250. It's a compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $8,250. Buying from John at $8,000 saves money and avoids further negotiation."
