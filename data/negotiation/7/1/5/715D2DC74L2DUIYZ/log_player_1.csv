Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $6,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle on $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant purchase, and I want to find a price point that works for both of us.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to drop to $11,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're invested in this product, and I am still interested, but $11,000 is pushing it.  My absolute final offer is $7,500. If you can't do that, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

**Reasoning:**

Bob has barely budged in his offers, indicating he's unlikely to significantly increase his price. Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
