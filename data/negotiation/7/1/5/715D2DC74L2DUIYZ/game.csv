"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $6,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant purchase, and I want to find a price point that works for both of us.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to drop to $11,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're invested in this product, and I am still interested, but $11,000 is pushing it.  My absolute final offer is $7,500. If you can't do that, I'll have to consider my other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
