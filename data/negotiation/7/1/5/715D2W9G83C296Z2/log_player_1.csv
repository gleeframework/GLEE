Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, so that's my floor.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Finding the sweet spot:**  I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a significant amount more than my minimum, but still leaves a good amount of profit for Bob.  It's likely to be appealing to him as he's getting a good deal.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal.  It's highly likely Bob will accept, as he's still getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of losing the product to someone else."
