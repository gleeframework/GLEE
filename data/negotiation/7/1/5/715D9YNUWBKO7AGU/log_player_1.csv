Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at the maximum value for Bob, giving him no immediate incentive to counteroffer. However, it leaves room for negotiation if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is still a significant amount, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $800,000.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still too low.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower offer.  It's best to secure the $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk."
