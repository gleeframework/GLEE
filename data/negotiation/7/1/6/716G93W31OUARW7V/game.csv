"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for its worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a fair price for this product. However, $1,125,000 is still beyond what I can currently afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it allows for a profitable outcome for you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer. However, I'm still limited in what I can pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a significant step closer to your price and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
