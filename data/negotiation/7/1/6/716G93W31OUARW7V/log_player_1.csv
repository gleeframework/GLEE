Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a fair price for this product. However, $1,125,000 is still beyond what I can currently afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it allows for a profitable outcome for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer. However, I'm still limited in what I can pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a significant step closer to your price and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,090,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a $90,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer. Closing the deal now secures a good profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging this out can be unproductive and lead to a stalemate. Accepting shows goodwill and a desire to finalize the deal."
