"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $975000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.

"I understand that you're willing to pay a premium, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $975000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit.
