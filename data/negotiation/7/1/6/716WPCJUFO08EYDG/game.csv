"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product. However, $1,200,000 is higher than my initial budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also ensuring a reasonable margin for myself. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we understand your position, we need to maintain our minimum price for the product to ensure a fair return for our investment. Therefore, we would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. This price still reflects the high value of the product and allows us to cover our costs and profit margin. We hope this proposal aligns better with your budget and looks forward to your response.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
