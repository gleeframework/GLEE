"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
