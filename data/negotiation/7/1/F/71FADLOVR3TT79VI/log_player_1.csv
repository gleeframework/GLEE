Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum desired value. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue myself. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I put pressure on Bob to make the first counteroffer. This gives me more information about his budget and willingness to negotiate. I'll then adjust my offers based on his responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the fact that I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired value of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price.  

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still below John's offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while reminding Bob that I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows him I'm not willing to settle for a low price, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value but still potentially appealing to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. I'm hopeful that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, as he knows I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum desired value.  

**Strategy:**

John is offering a price that meets my minimum requirements, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better outcome. It's more efficient to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
