"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I'm confident that's a fair price that we can both agree on.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13,000?  That's a good midpoint between our last offers, and hopefully a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
