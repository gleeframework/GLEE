Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This offer reflects its true worth and potential ROI.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals the product's high value.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at the product's desirability and Bob's potential to benefit from it. 
 
**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Ideal Scenario:**  Bob accepts the $1,300,000 offer, netting a profit beyond the guaranteed sale.
* **Acceptable Scenario:** Bob negotiates, potentially leading to a sale above $1,500,000.
* **Backup:** Bob rejects the offer, and I proceed with the guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000."
