"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a great price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. It makes more sense to counteroffer Alice or just buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though she's come down to $16,000, it's still above his budget. He can get the same product for $10,000 from John.  It makes more sense to counteroffer Alice again or just buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He's already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it seems like they're not going to meet in the middle. It's better for Bob to buy from John at this point and save himself the further negotiation."
