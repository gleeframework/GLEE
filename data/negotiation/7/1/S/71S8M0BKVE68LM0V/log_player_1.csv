Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I start the negotiation with Bob significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I start high, I don't want to completely discourage Bob. The offer of $950,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers.
* **Confident language:**  The message uses positive and confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
 
**Goal:** The ideal outcome is for Bob to accept the $950,000 offer. If he tries to negotiate down, I have room to maneuver while still staying above my minimum selling point of $1,000,000."
