Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, but still puts me in a good position to get a decent price. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the process. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but my product is worth significantly more.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must respectfully decline the $1500000 offer. I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, though it's getting closer. I'm not yet ready to settle for this price, so I will make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering you the product for $1,425,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. I am willing to consider $1400000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, so I'll counteroffer again.  I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still just a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,450,000.

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially end up with a lower offer.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if I want to try again with Bob."
