"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but my product is worth significantly more.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1500000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must respectfully decline the $1500000 offer. I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1350000 is still below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering you the product for $1425000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still just a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1450000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
