"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you're willing to pay. Let's discuss how we can make this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  This allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product to both parties, I am prepared to accept $10,800 for the product. This price reflects the product's worth to me while also accommodating your budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $10,800 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000. 
* **It's a good deal compared to John:** This price is $1,200 less than buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be pointless:**  Bob has already moved closer to Alice's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away, leaving Bob with the more expensive option of buying from John."
