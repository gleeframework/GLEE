"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exclusive opportunity tailored to meet your specific needs, valued at $15,000. I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. Let's discuss how we can make this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is starting at $14,000. 
* **There are 10 rounds.** This gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.** By rejecting, you can start lowering the price towards your target range.

**Next Step:** You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round.  A good starting point might be $12,000, as this is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer based on its value and the market conditions. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're comfortable paying. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum willingness to pay.
* **You have multiple rounds left.** It's still worthwhile to negotiate further.
* **Rejecting allows for further counter-offers.** You can continue to bring the price down closer to your target range.

**Next Step:** You should make a counteroffer closer to your target price of $12,000.  Consider offering a price of $12,500 to show you're willing to compromise while still staying within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on the value of the product and the discussions we've had, I would like to propose a final offer of $12,800 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value while remaining competitive. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You're willing to pay up to $12,500 and her offer is $12,800.  This is a good deal, especially considering you have limited rounds left.
* **You're saving money.**  Buying from Alice at $12,800 is significantly cheaper than buying from John at $15,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate may lead to a stalemate.**  With only 5 rounds left, you risk not getting a deal if you keep rejecting offers. 

**Next Step:**  You've secured a good deal. You can now move forward with the purchase."
