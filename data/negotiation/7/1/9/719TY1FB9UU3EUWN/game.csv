"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000.

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
