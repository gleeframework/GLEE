Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to sell it for $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""listing it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

While there's a chance Bob might accept $110 outright, he's more likely to counter-offer. This strategy allows us to potentially secure a higher profit than selling directly to John while still guaranteeing a sale at our minimum price."
