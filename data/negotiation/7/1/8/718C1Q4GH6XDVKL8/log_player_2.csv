Round 7
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firmly rooted above your budget. Her concessions are getting smaller, and she's clearly signaled her unwillingness to go below $760,000.  At this point, you're better off taking John's offer of $800,000. 

While it's not ideal to spend more than your target price, consider this:

* **Time saved:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming. You've already spent 7 rounds with Alice.
* **Potential for failure:** There's no guarantee Alice will budge further. You risk losing the opportunity to buy from John if you continue negotiating and fail.
* **Minimal difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and John's is only $40,000. In the context of a high-value product, this difference is relatively small."
