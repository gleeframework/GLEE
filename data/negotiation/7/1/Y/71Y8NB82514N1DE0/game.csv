"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you want to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,062,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,062,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,068,750? This feels like a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1068750.0,Alice,5,
