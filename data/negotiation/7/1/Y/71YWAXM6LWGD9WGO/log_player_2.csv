"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to own a product that's worth exactly that amount to you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full value. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. You have no incentive to accept Alice's offer since you're not saving any money. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her later or explore other options."
