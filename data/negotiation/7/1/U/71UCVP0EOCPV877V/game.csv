"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1600000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1700000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that the product's value to me is not as high as you think it is. I'm willing to go down to $1500000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1650000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not going any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1600000. However, I'm not willing to give up on the product's true value just yet. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1680000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1680000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1600000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it's not at a price I'm comfortable with.",1600000.0,Bob,10,
