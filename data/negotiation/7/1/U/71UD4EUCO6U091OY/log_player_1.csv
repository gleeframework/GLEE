Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. It's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a decent profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still keeps the price closer to what I want. I think Bob will be happy to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than what I can get from John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid any further back and forth. It's a reasonable price, and I can move on to other things."
