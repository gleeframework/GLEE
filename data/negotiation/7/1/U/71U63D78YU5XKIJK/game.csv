"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to stay a bit higher.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
