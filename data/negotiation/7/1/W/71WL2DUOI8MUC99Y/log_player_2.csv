Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer $825,000.

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, it's getting risky. She's made it clear this is her bottom line. Accepting at $825,000 secures a decent discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's backup price."
