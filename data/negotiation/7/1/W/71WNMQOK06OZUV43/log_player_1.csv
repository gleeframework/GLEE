"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get close to my minimum value while still leaving room for negotiation.  This initial offer is aggressive but leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I will counteroffer and continue to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for me and closer to a realistic compromise.  This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not desperate to sell and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but not by much. I want to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. $1,000,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a price Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a deal that doesn't benefit me.  I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer of $975,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but I also want to make sure I get as close to my minimum value as possible.  This is likely my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
