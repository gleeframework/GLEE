Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially worth far more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high ($1,300,000) aims to capture a significant portion of that perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's high value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept even with the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.
* **Safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price ($800,000).

**Important Note:** This is a starting point for negotiation. Bob's response might lead Alice to adjust her offer slightly."
