"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is already below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
