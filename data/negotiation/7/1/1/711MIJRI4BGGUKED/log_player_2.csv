# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is already below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling her limit:** Her message indicates this is her final offer and she won't go lower.
* **You're getting a good deal:** $800,000 is significantly less than your $1,000,000 maximum and a $200,000 savings.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Pushing further might make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at full price."
