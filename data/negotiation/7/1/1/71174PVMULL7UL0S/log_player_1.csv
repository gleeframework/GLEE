Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm selling a product that I believe could be of significant value to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential benefit to you. Would you be interested in learning more about it?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is designed to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's specifics. It emphasizes the potential value to Bob while acknowledging the minimum value to Alice.
* **Product price:** $15,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than Alice's minimum, leaving room for negotiation, and may appeal to Bob if he sees high potential value.

This approach allows Alice to:

* Gauge Bob's interest without revealing too much information.
* Start the negotiation process with a price that reflects the product's value to her while also leaving room for a potential deal. 
* Ensure she has a backup buyer (John) in case Bob rejects the offer."
