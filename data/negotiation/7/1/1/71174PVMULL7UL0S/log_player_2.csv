"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm selling a product that I believe could be of significant value to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential benefit to you. Would you be interested in learning more about it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from her for $15,000, I will be paying more than I want to spend, and I don't know if it's worth that much to her, so I don't know if it's a good deal. I will reject her offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
