Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Offering $130 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially settling at a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I won't accept anything less than $150, as that's what I can get from John.
* **Negotiating is worth it:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price. There's a chance I can get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $130 to $120. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I have other options (selling to John) and that I am willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $120 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **Possibility of a higher offer:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance he might increase his offer, or I might be able to find a compromise closer to my target.
* **Not rushing the decision:** I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise by lowering the price to $115. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **Close to Minimum:** $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm not yet at that point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm reminding Bob that I have the option to sell to John.  This keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer."
