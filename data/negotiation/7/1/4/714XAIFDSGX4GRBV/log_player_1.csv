Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm ready to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $14,000, or at least $12,000 to make it worth my while."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $12,750? It's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12750 is getting closer to my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and go up to $12500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $12,000 and closer to my target of $14,000.  It's a win-win, as Bob gets a good deal, and I get a decent profit."
