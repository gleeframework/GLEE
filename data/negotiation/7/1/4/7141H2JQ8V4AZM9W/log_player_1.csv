I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay given the product's value to him.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if needed, but I'm confident that this initial offer will spark a productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more acceptable price."

I'm countering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's initial offer while still staying above my minimum. I'm confident this price is fair and will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired selling point."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite enough. I'm willing to continue negotiations, but I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a price that works for both of us."

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob that I am flexible and willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough to close the deal, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been negotiating for a while, and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer is still below it.  I've made several compromises, but it seems like we might be at an impasse.  Rather than continue this negotiation, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000. It's important for me to get a price that reflects the true value of the product, and I'm happy with this outcome."
