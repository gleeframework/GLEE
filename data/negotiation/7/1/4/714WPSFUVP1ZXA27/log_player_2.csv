Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to push for a lower price risks jeopardizing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the product at this price than to potentially lose it by being too aggressive."
