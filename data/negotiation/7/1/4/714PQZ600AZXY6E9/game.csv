"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $95. That's a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $102. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $98 for it, which is very close to your asking price. Let's make this happen.",98.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $100.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",100.5,Alice,7,
