Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but below her minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob values other aspects (e.g., convenience). 
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:** By positioning it as a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob first, Alice creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially swaying Bob.
* **Justification:**  While not stating its worth to her, Alice subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the price by mentioning ""great deal for the value."" 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving Alice with the desirable alternative of selling to John at her minimum acceptable price."
