Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially even more so than mine. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product.  Its potential value far exceeds that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $825,000?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth countering again to try and reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now at the point where John's offer makes more sense than continuing to haggle with Bob. By offering $800,000, we're giving Bob a final chance to meet our minimum acceptable price. If he rejects this, we'll take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your offer, so I'm proposing $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still not meeting our minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we're unlikely to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 now outweighs the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
