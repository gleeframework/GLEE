Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still room to secure a better deal with Bob. We're making progress."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  Let's close this deal -  I'm willing to accept $1,187,500. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1187500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference again, showing willingness to negotiate but also drawing a firm line.  Adding ""final offer"" adds pressure for Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
