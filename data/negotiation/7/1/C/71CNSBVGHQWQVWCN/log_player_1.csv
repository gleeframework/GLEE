Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob away.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know how valuable it can be for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great value proposition for you."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing value and exclusivity.
* **The Price:**  $1,125,000 secures you $125,000 above your minimum, while Bob still saves $75,000 compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill."
