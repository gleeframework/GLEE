Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is very close to my desired price range.  There is a risk of further negotiations dropping the price, and with only a few rounds left, I feel it's best to secure this deal."
