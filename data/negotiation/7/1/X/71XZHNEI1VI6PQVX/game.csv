"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I do have other potential buyers who value this product at a higher price point. To be fair to both of us, I can only let it go for $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. If you're truly motivated to sell, I'm willing to offer $11,500.  This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
