Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I do have other potential buyers who value this product at a higher price point. To be fair to both of us, I can only let it go for $16,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

This is a tough one! Alice is pressuring with a ""final offer"", but it's still above your budget. There's a chance she'll come down further, especially since you're willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. If you're truly motivated to sell, I'm willing to offer $11,500.  This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  We acknowledge her position but stand firm on our budget limitations.
* **Small increase:** The $500 increase shows we're trying to meet her halfway but not caving in completely.
* **""Final offer"" tactic:** By using the same language, we signal seriousness and potentially prompt a more genuine response. 
* **Time pressure:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit, and Alice might be more willing to compromise rather than risk losing the sale. 

We're still in a risky position, but this strategy aims to strike a balance between pushing for a better deal and potentially losing the negotiation to John's guaranteed price."
