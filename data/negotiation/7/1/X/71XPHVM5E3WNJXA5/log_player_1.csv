"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, we anchor the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While we want to maximize profit, we also need to consider the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John. Starting too high might scare Bob away before real negotiation begins.

This first offer is a strategic starting point. We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his maximum budget. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, we have room to negotiate.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John's offer in mind as our safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about we settle for $1,750,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** We want to signal that Bob's offer was too low. This counteroffer, while lower than our initial price, is still considerably higher than Bob's, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Justification and Compromise:**  We're highlighting the product's value while framing the counteroffer as a compromise to keep Bob engaged.
* **Maintaining Distance from John's Offer:**  While we're lowering our price, we're staying far enough above John's offer ($1,500,000) to allow for further negotiation without jeopardizing a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant profit over his initial offer and a good deal overall.
* **Time Value:**  We're now in Round 4, and while we have time, each round carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Exceeding John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 avoids potential delays or complications that could arise from switching buyers.

By accepting Bob's offer, we secure a favorable outcome and avoid the risks of continued negotiation."
