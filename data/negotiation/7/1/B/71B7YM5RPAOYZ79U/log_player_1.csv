Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

``` 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I have 9 rounds left and can still get a better price or sell to John for my desired amount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to make sure I don't lose out on a better deal with John. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I still have time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. With 4 rounds remaining, I can still push for a higher price or decide to sell to John if negotiations stall."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given the value of the product, I can only go down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,425,000. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of time.  With only two rounds left, Bob is unlikely to increase his offer significantly. John is offering my desired price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John is the best option to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
