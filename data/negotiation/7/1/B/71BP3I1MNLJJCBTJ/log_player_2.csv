"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You have a budget of $12,000, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant step, but it's still within your budget. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but are also looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $9000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down a bit further. It's better to keep trying for a lower price than to settle now, especially since you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it down to $9,200.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate your commitment to a deal while pushing for a lower price.  By suggesting a compromise ($9,200 is the midpoint between $9,000 and $9,500), you are showing Alice that you are serious about reaching an agreement and are willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $9400.  It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still worth pushing for a bit lower.  You have a few rounds left, and there's still a gap between her offer and your ideal price. It's better to continue trying to negotiate and potentially get a better deal rather than accepting now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,400 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,300. It would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway and are serious about closing the deal.  You're pushing for a price just below her last offer, which indicates that you're genuinely interested in reaching a mutually acceptable price. This could be a good point to close the deal if Alice is flexible."
