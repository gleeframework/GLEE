"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. That's the highest I can go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
