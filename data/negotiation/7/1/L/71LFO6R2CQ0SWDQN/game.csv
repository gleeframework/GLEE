"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to sell.  I'm interested, but  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value I know you see in this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a little hesitant.  Would you be willing to come down to $11500? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
