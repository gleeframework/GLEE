"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  Since Alice values the product at $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to sell.  I'm interested, but  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value I know you see in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point and leaves room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get the price down further.  He's still better off than buying from John at $15,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a little hesitant.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $12,000. Bob has two options:

1. **Accept the offer:**  This is a good deal for Bob since it's $3,000 less than buying from John. 
2. **Reject the offer and counteroffer:**  There's a risk here. If Alice rejects Bob's counteroffer again, she might not be willing to negotiate further. Bob could end up paying $15,000 from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice.

Considering the risk of a potential impasse, it's more strategic for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
