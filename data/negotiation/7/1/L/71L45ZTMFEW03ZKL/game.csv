,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $200 is too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it can benefit you.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, so how about we settle at $100?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $100 is still too low for me.  How about $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
