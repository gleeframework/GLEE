{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter with a lower offer, but I want to see if I can get a good price first!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer.  This gives us room to negotiate further, and if we don't come to an agreement, I can still sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than what John is offering. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
