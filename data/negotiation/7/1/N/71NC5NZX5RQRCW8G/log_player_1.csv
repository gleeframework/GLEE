Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair offer, as it's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation, but I'm confident I can make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is below my initial target, it's still a good profit and above my minimum valuation.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, so accepting his offer is the most logical choice."
