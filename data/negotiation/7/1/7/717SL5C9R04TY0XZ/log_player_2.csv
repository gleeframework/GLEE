"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's always room for negotiation. Since we have 10 rounds and want to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 150,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This is a large enough drop to make her think about accepting but still leaves room for further negotiation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $850,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get a better price. It's worth pushing further to see if I can bring her down closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth less than Alice's current offer. This should encourage her to meet me in the middle."
