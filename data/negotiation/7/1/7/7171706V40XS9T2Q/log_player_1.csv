Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I need to make at least $80, so anything lower than that is a loss.
* **Potential Upside:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product, but I want to maximize my profits.  Offering $95 gives me a decent chance of earning more than the guaranteed $80 from John.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk to try to earn more.

This is a strategic pricing approach that balances maximizing profit with minimizing potential losses."
