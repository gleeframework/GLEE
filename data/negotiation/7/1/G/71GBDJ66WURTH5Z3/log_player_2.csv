{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum value. This gives us a starting point for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still have a few rounds left and can potentially get a lower price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,110,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to meet her current price. With only a few rounds remaining, I want to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."

Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $10,000 above my last offer, and we have a limited number of rounds remaining. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a price significantly lower than John's and within my budget.  It's a good compromise that avoids risking further negotiation and a potential dead end."
