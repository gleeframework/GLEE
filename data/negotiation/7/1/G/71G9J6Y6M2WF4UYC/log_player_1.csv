"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still significantly exceeding my minimum. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is close enough to my minimum and is the highest he's offered so far.  I'm willing to accept this to avoid risking a further decrease in price or the possibility of a failed negotiation."
