"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $1025000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1040000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this out.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1040000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1030000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about exploring other options, including buying from a competitor.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
