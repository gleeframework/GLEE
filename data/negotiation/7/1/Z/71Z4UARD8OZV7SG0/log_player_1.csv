Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below your $800,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than your fallback option (John at $800,000) but still attractive to Bob, considering his $1,200,000 valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing your potential earnings while ensuring you secure a good deal."
