"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I can see you're willing to pay a decent price, so I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
