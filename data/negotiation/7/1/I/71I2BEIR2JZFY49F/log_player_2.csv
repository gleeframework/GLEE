# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance she'll come down further, and I'm not eager to pay $95 when I know I can get it for $80 from John."
