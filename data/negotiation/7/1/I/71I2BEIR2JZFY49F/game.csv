"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $90?  I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
