**Reasoning:** 

It's clear that Alice is not budging much on her price. She rejected our offer of $100, which is our maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, the best option is to cut our losses and buy from John for $100, ensuring we stay within our budget."
