"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $9800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I can do $10200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
