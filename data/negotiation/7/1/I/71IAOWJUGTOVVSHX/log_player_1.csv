Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but could we work something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we try $12,000?  I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 is the best choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $12,000 is still a profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. A quicker sale is often better.
* **Uncertainty of Negotiation:** There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob, even with more rounds. 

Therefore, accepting the $12,000 offer ensures a reasonable profit without unnecessary risk."
