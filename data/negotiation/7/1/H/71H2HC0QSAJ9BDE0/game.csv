"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. However, I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to make a deal at $700,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and would be a fair compromise for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $700,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",850000.0,Alice,5,
