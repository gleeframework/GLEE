Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. However, I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to make a deal at $700,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and would be a fair compromise for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $700,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you get the product at the best possible price."
