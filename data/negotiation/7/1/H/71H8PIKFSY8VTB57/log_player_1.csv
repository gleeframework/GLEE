I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it's also realistic given Bob's potential value for the product.  I'm hoping this will make Bob think seriously about the deal without immediately rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price and leaves little room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make more money, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm worried that further negotiation will either drag on endlessly or result in an even lower offer from Bob.  Selling to John ensures a quick and clean deal at a price that's acceptable to me."
