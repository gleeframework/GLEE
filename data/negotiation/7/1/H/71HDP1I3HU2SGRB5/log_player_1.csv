Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation significantly increases your chances of a successful sale while maximizing your profit. Aiming for a price around $1,200,000 leaves a comfortable margin for Bob while securing you a substantial profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about Bob's position would be beneficial for refining your negotiation strategy."
