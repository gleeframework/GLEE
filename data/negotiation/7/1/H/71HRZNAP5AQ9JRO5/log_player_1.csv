Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my desired price point and I'm worried if I keep rejecting he might walk away.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
