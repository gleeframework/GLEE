Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $1,300,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to allow for negotiation room. 
    * Still substantially lower than John's offer, ensuring Alice makes a significant profit even if Bob negotiates down.
* **Confident Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high initial price. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
