{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000.**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500 right now.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $10,750. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be close to your minimum price, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my range.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to go up to $10,900. This is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,400. If this doesn't work out, I'll have to consider other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.** 
* **You only have 3 rounds left.  The negotiation is getting tense, and Alice is making it clear she's close to walking away.**  
* **It's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to get Alice down to a price you're comfortable with.**

At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John, even though you'll pay a slightly higher price. You're guaranteed to get the product, and you avoid the risk of losing the deal with Alice altogether."
