"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm comfortable with, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,500, which is a good compromise.  You can get the product for less than what John is selling it for, so it's a good deal."
