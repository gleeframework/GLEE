"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This would allow us both to make a decent profit and finalize the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
