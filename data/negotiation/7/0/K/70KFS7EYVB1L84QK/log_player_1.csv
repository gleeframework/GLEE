"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for more. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob, as he's shown willingness to negotiate. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the same amount."
