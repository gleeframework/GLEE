"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high, at $10,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and has a high budget. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering lower prices. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of not finding a higher price within the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation."
