"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a better alternative with John who is guaranteed to sell you the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John at your desired price point."
