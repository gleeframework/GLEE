"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a better option: buying from John for $1,000,000. It's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and explore a counteroffer that aligns with your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You've already established that you're willing to pay $1,000,000.  John offers the product at this price, making it the most financially advantageous option. Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but it risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at a guaranteed price."
