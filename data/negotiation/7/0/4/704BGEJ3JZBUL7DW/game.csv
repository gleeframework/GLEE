"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $135?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $132?",132.0,Bob,4,
