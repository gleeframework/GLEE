{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a higher price than the product's minimum value to me ($1,200,000).
* **Realistic expectation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my minimum price, but still reflects his interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **High enough to be attractive:**  $1,175,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to his value assessment. This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Emphasizing value:**  The message reiterates the product's value for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring it.

**Strategic Considerations:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, I'm aiming to secure a deal while still getting a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fallback on John's offer if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This seems like a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that we are both motivated to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for quick closure:** Accepting Bob's offer will lead to a quick and efficient transaction.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or an even longer negotiation process.
* **John's offer is a backup:** Even if I accept Bob's offer, I can still rely on John's offer for $1,200,000 if something goes wrong.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point. It minimizes the risk of further negotiation and secures a sale that's reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price."
