"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This seems like a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that we are both motivated to close this deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
