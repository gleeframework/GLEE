Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown a reluctance to move closer to my price point. While she might budge a little more, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000.  I can get the product for my maximum price from John, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
