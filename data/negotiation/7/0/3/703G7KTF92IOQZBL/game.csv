"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer for this round.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
