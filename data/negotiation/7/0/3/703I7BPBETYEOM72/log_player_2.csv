"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and save money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we meet at $112? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, and $112 is a reasonable price considering the value of the product. It's still cheaper than buying from John, and I'm confident that I can't get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy with this price and want to finalize the purchase."
