"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't agree to $1,300,000.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 and I might as well go with another seller. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we have a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
