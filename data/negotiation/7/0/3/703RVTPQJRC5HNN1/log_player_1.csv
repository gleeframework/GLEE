Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a good starting point.**  It's more than Bob values the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and optimistic.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **I'm not afraid to walk away.**  I know I have a backup buyer in John, so I can afford to be firm on my price. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's value, I'm increasing my chances of securing a deal with him while still getting a good price."
