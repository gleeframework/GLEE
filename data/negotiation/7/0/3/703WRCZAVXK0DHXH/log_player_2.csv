"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way above that. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, he's still better off trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum price. This counteroffer is a significant step up from his previous offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, securing a better deal. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again is high, and Bob might end up with a worse deal. It's more practical to secure the product from John."
