I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum right away. I believe there's still some room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit and shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value and even lower than what John is willing to pay.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose a sale. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
