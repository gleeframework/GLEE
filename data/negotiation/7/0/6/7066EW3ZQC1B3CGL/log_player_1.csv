Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,400,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.
