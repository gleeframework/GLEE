"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
