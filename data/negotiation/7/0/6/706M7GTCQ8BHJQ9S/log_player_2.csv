"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, $750,000 falls significantly short. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if she will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
