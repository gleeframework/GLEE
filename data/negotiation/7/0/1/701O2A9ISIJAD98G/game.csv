"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you, and this price reflects its value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is a good price for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $800000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
