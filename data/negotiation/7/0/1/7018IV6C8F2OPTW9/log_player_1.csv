"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price I believe represents a fair value for both of us.  I'm asking $1,500,000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions it as a unique opportunity.
* **Encouraging consideration:** I encourage Bob to think carefully about the offer, hoping to spark his interest and potentially avoid an immediate rejection. 

**Note:**  I'm aware that there's a risk of losing Bob as a buyer with such a high starting price. However, the potential for a higher sale price outweighs the risk in my eyes, given my option to sell to John for $1,200,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. Considering my budget and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm not in a rush to sell and have a safety net with John's offer.  By rejecting this offer, I can attempt to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to come down to $1,400,000.  Considering the unique features and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but not going all the way to his price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's unique features and potential to justify the price. 
* **Positive outlook:** The message aims to keep the negotiation amicable and create a sense of shared value.

**Rationale:**

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's offer without compromising too much on my own desired price. By holding firm at $1,450,000, I'm demonstrating my seriousness while still leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've done some research and think we can find a common ground. I'd like to propose a price of $1425000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm still in a good position, as I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.  

**Rationale:**

While I could accept this offer and secure a sale, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,440,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1440000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not conceding fully. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position.
* **Focus on value:** I'm continuing to reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** The message remains positive and aims to build a sense of consensus.

**Rationale:**

I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price but still provides a reasonable margin of profit.  With only five rounds left, I want to ensure a sale without significantly underselling myself. This counteroffer is a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best approach to maximizing my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After reviewing our previous discussions, I believe we can reach an agreement. I would like to propose a final price of $1430000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,430,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only four rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John if I reject this offer and continue negotiating. 

**Rationale:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the chance of reaching a more favorable price with Bob is decreasing.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative option:** I have a secure alternative with John's offer of $1,200,000, which gives me confidence in my decision.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer in this round is the most logical choice to maximize my potential earnings while minimizing risk."
