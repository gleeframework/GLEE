"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need a significantly lower price to make it work.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $9,000 at this point.  It's my absolute final offer, and I hope we can find common ground. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
