"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price that allows you to make a significant profit, and it's still well above what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I believe this price point would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $1,000,000? This would still give you a good profit margin while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While $1,000,000 is an improvement, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns better with my financial constraints while still allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll come down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get closer to my desired value. Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,
