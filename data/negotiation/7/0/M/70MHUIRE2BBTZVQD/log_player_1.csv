Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm assuming Bob is likely to counter-offer, so I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to achieve a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $13,000 is a fair price that's closer to my initial goal and still higher than what I could get from John.  It seems like further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, so I'm accepting to secure the deal."
