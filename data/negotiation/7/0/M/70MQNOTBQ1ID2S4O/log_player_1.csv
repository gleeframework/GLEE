"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible. This price is still a good deal for Bob, as he values it at $8,000. I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my asking price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price closer to my preferred price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than my asking price in round 1 and more than his offer in round 2. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not at my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in hopes we can find a compromise before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a midpoint that's still favorable to me while potentially making Bob feel like we're both making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to consider. I've reached my limit on how much I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident that John will give me my minimum asking price, so I'm going to sell to him."
