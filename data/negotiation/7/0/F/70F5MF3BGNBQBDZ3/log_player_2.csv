You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $110 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider that price?

$110 is a good price, and it's still within your budget. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential price increases from Alice."
