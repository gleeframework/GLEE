"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($800,000).  Rejecting this offer sets you up to get a much better deal."
