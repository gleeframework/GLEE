"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm open to negotiation, but still aiming for a profit.  $150 is a good middle ground and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly below my preferred price, but it's better than selling to John for the minimum. With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation."
