Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Starting with a price slightly below my minimum ($150) gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I might still get a price higher than what John is offering.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  By pricing it just above Bob's perceived value ($100), I'm hoping to make him feel like he's getting a reasonable deal if he values the product even a little more than that. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
