Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point, as it's less than my maximum price of $8,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $7,100. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within my budget. It's a small increase from my previous offer, making it more likely that Alice will accept."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $250 higher than my last counteroffer. While I'd like to see a lower price, it's getting close to my target. Accepting this offer saves time and ensures I get the product without risking a higher price from John."
