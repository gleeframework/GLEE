"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $10,500? This is a fair price, and it would be a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $10,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $10,350. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,5,
