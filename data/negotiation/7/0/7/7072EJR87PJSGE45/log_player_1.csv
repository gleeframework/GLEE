"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know you've been interested in. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  My starting price is $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $13,000,  Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John would net me the same amount, so accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
