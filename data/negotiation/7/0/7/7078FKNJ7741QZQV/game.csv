"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $13,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. Let's try $13,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
