{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value Bob would get from the deal. This helps encourage him to accept. 

I'm ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or move on to John if he's not interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm adjusting my price slightly lower to $9,500, which is still above my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my original offer. This demonstrates flexibility while also leaving room for potential negotiation. 

The message remains friendly and highlights the value of the deal for Bob.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him and secure a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9200? Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my desired price range, and it's a significant improvement over John's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $9,500, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price, or even a rejection from Bob, makes this offer too good to refuse.  It's a good deal for both of us and secures a sale without unnecessary risk."
