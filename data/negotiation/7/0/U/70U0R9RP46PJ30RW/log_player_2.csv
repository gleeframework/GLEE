"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I believe it's a valuable addition to any collection or business. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no incentive to negotiate. You can get the product for the same price from John."
