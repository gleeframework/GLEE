"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $13,000 if possible. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you consider $13,500? This would be a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a fantastic deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending below $13,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $12,800? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,4,
