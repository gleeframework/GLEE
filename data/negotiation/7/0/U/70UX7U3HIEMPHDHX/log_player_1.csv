Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,620,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,620,000 is only $20,000 less than my last counteroffer. It's a good price considering the limited rounds left.  While I'd prefer more,  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's lower offer."
