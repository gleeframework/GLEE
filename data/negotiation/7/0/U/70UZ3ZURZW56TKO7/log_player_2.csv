"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still quite a bit more than Alice's valuation. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but it's still above her valuation of $800,000. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation and should encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you'd ideally like to pay. There's still a good chance Alice will come down further with another counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice rejected your previous offer of $850,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise â€“ it's higher than your last offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  This should hopefully encourage her to come down to a mutually agreeable price."
