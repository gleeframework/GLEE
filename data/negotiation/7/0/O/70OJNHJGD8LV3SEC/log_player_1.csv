Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 90}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. Since I'm willing to sell the product for at least $80, I'll consider Bob's offer. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up on potentially getting a better price.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. Here's a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 87}

I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle or come down a bit more in price. If not, I'll be ready to sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's counteroffer of $87 is a bit higher than my initial offer of $85, so I'll try to meet him in the middle. Here's my next counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 86}

I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob, but if not, I'm still willing to negotiate further or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $83 is getting closer to my minimum price of $80, but I'm still not sure if I want to settle for that. I'll consider my options carefully.

Since I'm willing to sell the product for at least $80, I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. Here's a new counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 82}

I'm hoping Bob will come down a bit more in price, but if not, I'll be ready to sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's offer of $83 is still a bit too low, but my latest counteroffer of $82 was a bit too high. I'll try to find a middle ground. Here's my next counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 81}

I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob, but if not, I'm still willing to negotiate further or sell to John for $80."
