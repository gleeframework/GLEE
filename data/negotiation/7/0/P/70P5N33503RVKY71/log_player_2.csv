Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $100 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $115, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you

While I could try to haggle Alice down a bit further, it's getting risky.  She might not budge much from $115, and I'm already saving a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially miss out."
