"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than John's price of $150, Bob can likely get a better deal. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $130 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $135 is a fair compromise, and it's still below John's price of $150.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John.
* **No significant savings:**  While a lower price is always better, the potential savings from further negotiation may not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
