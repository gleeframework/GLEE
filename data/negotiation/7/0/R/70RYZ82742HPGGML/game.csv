"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and provides a good starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
