"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $1,500,000. This is a significant difference, and it's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and provides a good starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
