Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer, as he perceives he's getting a good deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I know you'll see its value. I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:**  The offered price is just below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, making it attractive.
* **Messaging:**  The message is concise, positive, and hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:**  Bob may counter-offer. Alice needs to decide if she's willing to negotiate further or stick closer to her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Is there a time constraint? If John's offer might expire, Alice may need to factor that into her negotiation with Bob."
