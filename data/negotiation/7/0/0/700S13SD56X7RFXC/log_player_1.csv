Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than what I'd sell to John, but leaves room for negotiation, recognizing Bob values the product more. It allows me to potentially earn more while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is exactly what I offered him in the first round, so it's a good deal for me.  I don't want to risk him walking away entirely, or further lowering his offer.  Accepting ensures I get a good price, just below what I believe the product is worth to him."
