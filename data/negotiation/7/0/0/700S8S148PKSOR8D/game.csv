"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the immense value it will bring to your endeavors.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects the product's value and enables you to make a profitable sale.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay firm at $890,000. This price accurately reflects the value and potential this product offers. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
