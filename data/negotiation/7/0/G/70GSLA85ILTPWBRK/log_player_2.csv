"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a fair price for it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $17,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000 and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John directly."
