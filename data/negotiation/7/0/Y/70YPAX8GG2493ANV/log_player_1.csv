Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still being a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to try to get a better price from him before resorting to selling to John."
