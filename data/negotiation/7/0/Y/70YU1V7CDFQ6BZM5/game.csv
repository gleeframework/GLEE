"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1500000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to make a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is still beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm getting closer to where I want to be, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer you $800000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
