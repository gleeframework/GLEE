# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. It's worth exploring the possibility of getting the price down before resorting to buying from John at a much higher price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to make a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is still beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
