"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While your offer is tempting, I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,112,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,112,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $1,062,500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
