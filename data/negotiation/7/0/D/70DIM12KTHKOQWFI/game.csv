"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,165,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1,190,000. It's a small step closer to my price, and it could be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1190000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $1,180,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
