"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $85 is closer but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Let's split the difference.  How about $90?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.**  This is still a bit more than you'd like, but it's getting closer to your ideal price.
* **John is selling the product for $100.**  This is a worse deal than Alice's current offer.
* **Negotiation is a give and take:**  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further.  Accepting the offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
