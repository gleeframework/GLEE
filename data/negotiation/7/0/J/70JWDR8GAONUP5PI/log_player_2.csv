"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's better to try and save some money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate and we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only $50,000 more than what John is selling the product for.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially losing the deal isn't worth it for a small savings. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price."
