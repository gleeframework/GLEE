"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $125 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $135 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me at $130? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and $130 is a good deal. It's significantly better than selling to John for $120 and still gives me a decent profit."
