,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $135 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me at $130? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",130.0,Bob,4,
