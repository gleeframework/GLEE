,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only go as high as $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is still a bit too high. I can offer you $11,000, which is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
