"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm aiming for a price around $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to try negotiating with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He can try to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
