Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This gives me a chance to see if Bob is willing to pay my value. If he isn't, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd rather sell to him than John, $80 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is still above Bob's offer, but a bit closer to what he's willing to pay. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach a deal, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is still a good deal for me.  It's better than selling to John for $100, and it seems unlikely that Bob will offer more."
