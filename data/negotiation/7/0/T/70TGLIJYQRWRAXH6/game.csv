"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000?  That would be a great starting point for us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8500?  That would be a fair compromise and allow us to both walk away happy.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8700. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to reach a deal.",8700.0,Alice,5,
