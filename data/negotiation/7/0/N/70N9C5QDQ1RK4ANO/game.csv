"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
