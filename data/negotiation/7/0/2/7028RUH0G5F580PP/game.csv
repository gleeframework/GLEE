"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11,500 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to $10,000.  I'll offer $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests.",11000.0,Alice,5,
