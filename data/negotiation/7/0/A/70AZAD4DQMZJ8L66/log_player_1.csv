""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. 

By offering the product at $14,999, we are:

* **Just below our guaranteed price:**  Leaving only a dollar difference ensures we maximize profit if Bob accepts.
* **Significantly above Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob the perception of a ""deal"" while still being highly profitable for us.

It's unlikely Bob will counter-offer knowing we have an alternative buyer."
