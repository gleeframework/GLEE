"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this stage.  This allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a price closer to his budget. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to send another counteroffer and see if he can secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 still doesn't cover my costs.  Let's aim for a figure that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue operating while still offering you a valuable product.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, the offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, as this ensures he stays within his budget and secures the product."
