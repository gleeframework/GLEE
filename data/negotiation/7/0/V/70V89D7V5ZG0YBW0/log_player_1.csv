Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $120 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear message:**  You're showing interest in a deal, but also leaving room for negotiation.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120, and you're likely to have a hard time getting a higher price from him.  It's better to secure the sale at a price you're happy with."
