"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This gives us both a bit of wiggle room and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is halfway between our last offers.  Let's try to make this work!",11000.0,Bob,4,
