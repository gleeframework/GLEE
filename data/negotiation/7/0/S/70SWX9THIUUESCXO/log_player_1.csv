Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This still leaves a little room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
