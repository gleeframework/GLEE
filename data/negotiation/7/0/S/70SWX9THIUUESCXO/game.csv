"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This still leaves a little room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  Unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $10,500.  That's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think, and we can explore other options if this isn't workable.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a compromise from my previous offer.  This is my final counteroffer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
