"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $77.50 is still a little too low for me.  How about $82.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. How about we try $79.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",79.5,Bob,6,
