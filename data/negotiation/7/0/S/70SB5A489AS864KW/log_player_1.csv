{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation. It's a price higher than my minimum, but it's still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counteroffer and us to potentially find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $60, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $77.5 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $77.50 is still a little too low for me.  How about $82.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. How about we try $79.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $79.50 is close to my minimum, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
