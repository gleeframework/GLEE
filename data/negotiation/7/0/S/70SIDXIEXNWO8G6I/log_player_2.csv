"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice.  You have a lot of room to potentially get a better price than $1,000,000.  $950,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a good price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $925,000, which I think is a very competitive price considering its potential worth to you.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but $925,000 is still too high.  Let's try to push her down a little further with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. While I agree the product has potential,  $925,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value I'm seeing. Let's keep this negotiation going and see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $900,000 is still too high. You can probably squeeze out a little more in the next few rounds.  It's worth trying to get a better price than what John is offering before you go to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle at $885,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm hopeful you'll see it the same way."", ""product_price"": 885000}
