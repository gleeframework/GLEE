"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a good price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $925,000, which I think is a very competitive price considering its potential worth to you.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."",
""product_price"": 925000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. While I agree the product has potential,  $925,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value I'm seeing. Let's keep this negotiation going and see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is incrementally increasing his offer.  We still have room to negotiate before hitting John's offer, so the risk of continuing is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Adding a touch of finality can encourage Bob to act quickly. This offer balances a strong return with the understanding that dragging out the negotiation might not yield a drastically better result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle at $885,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm hopeful you'll see it the same way. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and is now above our safety net of $800,000. Accepting at $885,000 locks in a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
