(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he has a fixed budget of $12,000, he should start by offering the lowest possible price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This counteroffer sets a clear boundary and establishes Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is trying to get the best price possible while staying within his budget. Offering $15,000 is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer of $18,000.  This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but still wants a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $16,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering again, aiming for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still trying to get the best price possible while staying within his budget. Offering $15,500 is a compromise, showing Bob is willing to negotiate further while staying within his budget. This approach demonstrates Bob's commitment to reaching a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $16,000 is close to Bob's preferred price point, but it's still above his budget. At this point, the negotiation is going back and forth, and it's uncertain if a deal can be reached that benefits both parties. It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John at $12,000, saving him $4,000 compared to Alice's offer."
