"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and encourages him to counter.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the deal as being good for both of us, highlighting the win-win potential.

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer for $120, which provides me with a safety net.  I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** I'm aiming for at least $120, and while $90 is closer, it's not enough. 
* **I have a backup option with John.** This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I'm not at a point where I need to settle. I'll continue exploring if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, still aiming to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm adjusting my price downwards to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the deal's value for Bob, emphasizing the win-win aspect.
* **Progress Towards Agreement:** I'm trying to create momentum towards a deal by closing the gap between our positions.

**Note:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind.  If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I can always switch to John.  However, I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and would like to propose $93 for the product. This still saves you some money while bringing us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and each round gets us closer to the point where selling to John becomes more appealing.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer doesn't preclude future deals with Bob. It shows flexibility, which could lead to better partnerships down the line.

While $93 is not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise that secures a sale without jeopardizing the potential for future deals."
