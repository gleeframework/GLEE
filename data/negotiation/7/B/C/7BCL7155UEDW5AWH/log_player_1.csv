Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to pay $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $140 is still outside my budget.  How about $100? That's a good compromise and  I'm sure it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100.  This product is worth a lot more than that!  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  That's my top price, and I don't want to go any higher.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge past $100.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Accepting $150 from John ensures the best possible outcome for Alice at this point."
