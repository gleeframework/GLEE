"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to pay $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $140 is still outside my budget.  How about $100? That's a good compromise and  I'm sure it would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100.  This product is worth a lot more than that!  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  That's my top price, and I don't want to go any higher.  Let's see if we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,
