"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I can't disclose specifics yet,  I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000. This is a price that allows both of us to benefit, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous potential it offers.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While she claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth that much to you.  It's better to reject her offer and go with John's guaranteed price of $800,000."
