"I appreciate the opportunity to acquire the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the  $1,200,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,050,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my financial constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
