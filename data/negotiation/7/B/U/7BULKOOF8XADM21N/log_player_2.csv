"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, you can likely get it for less. You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to ensure I get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

``` 
Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good deal. It's still less than what you'd pay John, and it's close to your last counteroffer.  It's worth accepting and avoiding any further back-and-forth."
