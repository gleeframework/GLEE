{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I can come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $8,000."
