"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum value. This is to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm increasing the price a bit, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  This leaves room for further negotiation, but keeps the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. I've already rejected his offer twice, and selling to John is still an option, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
