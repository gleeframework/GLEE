"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
