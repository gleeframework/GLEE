Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and will allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.

Alice has met your backup price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to get it lower, or going to John.  This secures the product at the best possible price."
