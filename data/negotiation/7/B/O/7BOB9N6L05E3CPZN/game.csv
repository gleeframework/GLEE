"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price of $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  Let's aim for a compromise that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the price I'm willing to go up to. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
