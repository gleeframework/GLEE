,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a stretch for me.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal right now.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and offer $130. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth it for you to get it.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm firm on $120.  Let's close this deal.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can both move on.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $127.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth it for you to get the product.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really pushing my budget at $127.50.  To make this work, I need to stick with my last offer of $120.  It's a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll agree it's fair.",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $120. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $125. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth it for you to get the product.",125.0,Alice,9,
