"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you at $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is valuable, which might make him reconsider his initial assessment. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute maximum to allow for potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I want to see if I can get a higher offer from him before resorting to selling to John.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counter-offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counter-offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's worth to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and upbeat to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:**  While I'm coming down, the price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I've already made a significant concession.  There's still a chance Bob might come up slightly higher in the next round. 
* **Time is on my Side:**  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I don't want to settle too quickly if a better offer is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my offer.  I'm happy to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $10,150. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, making me seem reasonable.
* **Fair Price:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message is now focused on closing the deal, adding pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Small Concession:**  The offer is just slightly higher than Bob's last offer, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even with Bob's offer getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing to John:** I'm aware that I have only 4 rounds left, and if I don't reach a satisfactory price soon, I might need to sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer slightly.  I want to see if I can push him a bit further before making a final decision."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to make one final concession, and come down to $10,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's my last offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This is my last offer, signaling that I am serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the price, hoping to sway Bob towards accepting.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message is focused on closing the deal, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.
* **Small Concession:**  While I'm making a concession, it's a small one, showing that I'm not willing to give in entirely. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is high.
* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is more than what I can get from Bob at this point.
* **No More Room for Negotiation:** There's not enough time to continue negotiating with Bob, and he's already stated this is his final offer. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than risk losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
