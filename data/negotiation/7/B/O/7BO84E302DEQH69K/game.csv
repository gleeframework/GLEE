"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my offer.  I'm happy to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $10,150. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider it?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to make one final concession, and come down to $10,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's my last offer.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,8,
