"Alice, I'm happy to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $105?  It's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is just a few dollars more than my minimum price. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
