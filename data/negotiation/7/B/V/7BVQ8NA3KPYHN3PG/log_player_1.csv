{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts by setting a high price ($120) but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's potential counteroffer.  It also frames the product as ""amazing"" to subtly boost its perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This is the maximum I am willing to pay given my budget constraints. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's also the same price I could get from John.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
