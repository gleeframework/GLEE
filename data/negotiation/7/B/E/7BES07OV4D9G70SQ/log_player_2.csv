"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $125 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you prompt her to potentially offer a lower price. If her next offer is still above your liking, you can always go with John as a backup."
