"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it will be a real asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, but that's still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
