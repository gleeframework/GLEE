"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a relatively low counter-offer.  This does a few things:

* **Establishes a bargaining position:** It signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal and not simply going to accept a price close to their initial offer. 
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** Her response will give me an idea of how much she's willing to budge.

Even if this offer is rejected, it gives me room to negotiate upwards in later rounds while still staying below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $120?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a great deal! Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, meaning we are getting it for the absolute lowest price she's likely willing to go.  There's no need to negotiate further."
