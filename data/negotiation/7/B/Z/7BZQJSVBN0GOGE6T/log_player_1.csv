Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $1300000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'd like to throw in a condition. If you're willing to sell the product for $1300000, I'd like to negotiate a longer warranty or some additional support for the product. This would make the deal more attractive to me and justify the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer to negotiate further and get closer to my initial goal, I'm running out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer with the added condition of a longer warranty or support for the product secures a good price and potentially adds value to the deal."
