"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is too high.  I'm only interested in paying a price that reflects the product's value to me, which is around $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my starting point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While the product holds significant value for you at $1,200,000, its potential impact and unique aspects justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both our positions.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This price is fair for both of us considering the value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I've received interest from other potential buyers, however, I value our interaction and believe we can still reach an agreement.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,400,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
