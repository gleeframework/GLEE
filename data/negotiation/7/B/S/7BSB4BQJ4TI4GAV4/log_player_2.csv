"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,050,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is substantially lower than Alice's opening price.  While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By aiming low, I signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a fallback option, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still $50,000 higher than John's. I'll hold firm and see if she's willing to go lower. There's little risk in rejecting this offer as I have John's price to fall back on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  If you'd be willing to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** By revealing John's offer, I'm creating transparency and a sense of urgency. This signals that I'm serious about John's offer as a viable alternative.
* **Fairness:**  Matching John's offer isn't unreasonable and positions me as a fair negotiator. 
* **Simplified Decision:** This counteroffer gives Alice a very clear choice â€“ match the price and close the deal or potentially lose the sale."
