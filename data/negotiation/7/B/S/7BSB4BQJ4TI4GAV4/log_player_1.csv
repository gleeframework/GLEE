Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the benefit to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.  This increases the likelihood of a successful deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm using this as a safety net. I'll only switch to John if the negotiation with Bob completely fails. 
* **Bob's Potential Counteroffer:**  I'll need to carefully consider any counteroffer from Bob. I'm aiming for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation and a potential for a better price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not ready to accept John's offer yet. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll carefully consider Bob's potential financial constraints and try to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Maintain Value:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate but also maintains the value of the product for me.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll get by purchasing it. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation. I'm prepared to consider a counteroffer from Bob, but I'm confident this price is fair and represents a good deal for both of us. 

**Key Points:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup. 
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counter with a price closer to $1,250,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  If you'd be willing to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant profit for me.
* **Time is Money:**  Bob is ready to close the deal today. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids potential delays in negotiating further.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, the potential time and effort involved in dealing with him (and the possibility of further negotiation) makes Bob's offer the more attractive option at this point.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk and time commitment associated with further negotiation."
