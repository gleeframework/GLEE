Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,200 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it is still above your target of $8,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'd like to propose an alternative. I can offer you a small concession by including a premium service package with the product, which typically costs $200. This way, the total value you'll receive is still higher than my initial offer, and you'll get additional benefits. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,300, including the premium service package. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $8,300 is just slightly above your target price of $8,000, and it includes a premium service package worth $200. This makes it a good deal considering you still save money compared to buying from John."
