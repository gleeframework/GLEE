"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. 
* There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, indicating a potential for a lower price. 
* I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. 
* While there's a possibility of negotiating further, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach an agreement. 
*  To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John for $800,000."
