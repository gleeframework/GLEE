# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that is fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, and I believe you'll be happy with the purchase. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
