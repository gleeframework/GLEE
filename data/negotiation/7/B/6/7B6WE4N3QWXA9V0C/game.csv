"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I think this price is more reflective of the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I think this price is more reflective of the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I still believe $1,050,000 is too high.  To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and puts us very close to a successful deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your last offer, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $1,050,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this price still reflects the product's true worth and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
