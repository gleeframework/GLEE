Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he wishes, while still ensuring a substantial profit for you (and potentially more than John's offer).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of that value."
