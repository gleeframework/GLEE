"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an investment that holds immense value and can significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its worth to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value and what others are willing to pay, aiming to ensure mutual satisfaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, while John wants $12,000.
* **The price is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so $10,000 is a good deal. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
