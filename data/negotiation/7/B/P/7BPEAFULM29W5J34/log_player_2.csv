# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100.  You should try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $92? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still do better than $92.  You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $88 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting the offer is the best option. You've gotten the price down to $90, which is within your budget and a good deal.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get stubborn and you'll end up paying more or having to buy from John at $120."
