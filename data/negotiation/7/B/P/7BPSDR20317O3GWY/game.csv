"Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm initially offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  $12000 is definitely closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  This would give me a little more room to work with while still being a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. How about we compromise at $13000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
