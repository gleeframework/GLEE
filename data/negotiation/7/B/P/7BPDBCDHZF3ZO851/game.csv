"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm really not comfortable going any lower than $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other offers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
