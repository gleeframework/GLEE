"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price above my minimum but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his estimated value to secure the product.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want, I am not willing to sell for that price.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by negotiating. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not by much.  This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's original offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly higher than his initial proposal, but still well below my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I believe I can still get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob. We are nearing the middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm dropping my price a little more, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's above Bob's offer. It's clear that we're both willing to compromise, and this offer shows that I'm taking his counter-offers seriously.  I'm confident that we can find a deal in the next few rounds."
