"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $12,000 would be a loss.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, I'm only able to pay $9,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to accept that price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has offered $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $10,000. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John instead."
