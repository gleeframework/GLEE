"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value, I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's desired price point while still leaving Alice a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will either reject further counteroffers or that Bob will end up paying the full $15,000 to John. Accepting the offer at $13,500 ensures Bob gets a good deal with less risk."
