"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing price to Bob, while still ensuring that I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $125, which is a good price considering it's getting closer to my desired profit. Accepting this offer ensures a better deal than selling to John, and there's a chance that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price."
