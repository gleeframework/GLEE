Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle closer to our desired price. 
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, a faster sale to Bob might be preferable for cash flow reasons, even if it means a slightly lower profit margin. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations.
* We're balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer against the potential for a higher profit."
