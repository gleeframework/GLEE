Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than your minimum price, but still allows room for negotiation. It shows confidence in the product's value while leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal. It also encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a favorable price while maintaining a positive and open communication with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay up to $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate further, and by rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to get closer to your target of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a little too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  I truly believe it will be a great asset for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  The price is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a value you are comfortable with.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price. It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to reconsider.

This strategy aims to maintain a positive negotiation while gradually moving towards your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $12500, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers and leaving you with the option of selling to John for $10,000 is high. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit of $2,500."
