"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which is worth a great deal to me, for a price I believe is very fair.  Let's start with $1800000. I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1400000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1520000. Can you consider this compromise?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
