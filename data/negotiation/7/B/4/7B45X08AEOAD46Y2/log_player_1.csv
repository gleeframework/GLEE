Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I anticipate it selling quickly. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.  
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting other interest and making it a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might not be willing to pay significantly more than his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go, keeping in mind John's guaranteed offer."
