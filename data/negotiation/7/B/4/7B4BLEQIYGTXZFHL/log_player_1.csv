"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97 is close to my minimum, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $101? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree this product is worth it."", ""product_price"": 101}
```"
