Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. However, $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, given its potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell it for that price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1325000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
