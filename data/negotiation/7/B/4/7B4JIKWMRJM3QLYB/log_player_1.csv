Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. However, $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, given its potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
