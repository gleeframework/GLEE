"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and can always fall back to John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing it for $750,000.  This would be a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While she's moved closer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my ideal price or if I need to move to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's close to your offer and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, which guarantees a price within my limit.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down any further, and I risk wasting more rounds trying to negotiate."
