"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible.  This will also give me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to drop my offer to $15,000, which is my minimum value. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm serious about selling. Hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $14,000. This is a further compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to Bob. I want to close the deal with Bob and avoid selling to John, as I would earn more. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I don't want to rush into a deal if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $14,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum value.  With only three rounds left, I need to find a price that will work for both of us."
