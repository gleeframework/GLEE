"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your offer.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my research, I believe a fair price for this product would be around $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell. There are still 8 rounds left. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? This is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and the condition of the product, I believe $110 would be a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up from his initial offer of $100, and I'm getting closer to my target price.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I could potentially get a better price, but it's getting late in the game. $110 is a decent offer and better than selling to John for $100."
