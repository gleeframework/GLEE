Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations on the higher end, leaving room for compromise. This starting point is ambitious but still below Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,100,000, there's a good chance Bob will negotiate, but we're still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remember that we have John as a backup buyer. This allows us to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing we have a fallback option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still a considerable distance from our initial offer and closer to Bob's perceived value.  We have room to negotiate further and try to meet somewhere in the middle. 

By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about getting a fair price while still leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows Bob we're willing to negotiate but also reinforces the product's value.
* **Strong Position:**  $1,000,000 is a strong position. It's a significant profit margin above our minimum and still a good deal for Bob considering its worth to him.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By countering, we keep the negotiation moving forward and demonstrate our interest in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we settle on $950,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit, well above our minimum selling price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer from this point.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now brings in the money sooner, which is generally advantageous. 

While we could push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer isn't worth the potential reward at this stage. Accepting $950,000 represents a successful negotiation."
