"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,300,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the market value of similar products.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
