"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this point. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might seem steep, Bob. However, this product is truly top-quality and worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we both value this product, but we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $150, my absolute lowest. This is a fantastic deal for something of this quality.",150.0,Alice,5,
