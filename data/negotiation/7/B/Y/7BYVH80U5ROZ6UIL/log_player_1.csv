Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd find very useful.  I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This can make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter. If he does, I can then adjust my price depending on his offer and how determined I am to sell to him. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup. If negotiations with Bob don't work out, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is far below my minimum of $15,000, and even significantly lower than the value of the product to me. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unreasonable, it opens the door for further negotiation.  I can counter with a more reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit. 
* **Selling to John is the backup:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is a bit too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to drastically lower my price.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $9,000, he's getting a good deal considering the product's worth to him.
* **Moving Forward:** The message suggests that this offer is a good starting point for finalizing the deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll see if Bob accepts this counteroffer. If he doesn't, I can either counter again or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That would be a good deal for me and still a decent price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still space for negotiation. I can make another counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **Minimizing risk:**  I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my minimum.  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer once more. I will aim for a price that is closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still quite a bit below what I need for this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter:** This is likely my last counteroffer before selling to John. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a solution.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that $8,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language and expressing confidence that this is a fair price for both of us.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $15,000."
