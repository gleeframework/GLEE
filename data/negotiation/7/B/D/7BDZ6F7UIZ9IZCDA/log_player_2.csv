"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the maximum you are willing to pay is $120 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the best option to accept the offer.  There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
