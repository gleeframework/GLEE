"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a reasonable price considering Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you've expressed and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've expressed and the value you've expressed as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,500,  it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is preferable to risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal."
