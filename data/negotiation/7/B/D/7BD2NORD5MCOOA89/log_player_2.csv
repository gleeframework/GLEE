"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. You have a clear upper limit of $10,000, so rejecting the initial offer and attempting to counter-offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong opening move, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  I'm assuming that the product is likely worth less than $5,000 to Alice,  and this counteroffer gives her room to compromise while still getting a better deal than selling to John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting and counter-offering again, I can potentially get a price even closer to my desired range, potentially around $3,500.  I'm also leaving some space for Alice to accept a compromise, as she's clearly not willing to sell for my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from $3,000 to $3,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still staying within my budget.  The goal is to find a middle ground between our initial offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and closer to my preferred price, there's still a possibility of getting it lower. I'm going to continue to counter-offer, hoping to meet in the middle at a price around $4,000.  With 5 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $4,000. This is a significant move, indicating that I am willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a lower price than Alice's last offer. With only four rounds left, I want to close the deal but need to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price of $4,000.  With only three rounds remaining, it's not likely I'll be able to negotiate much lower.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for less than John's price while still leaving room to potentially counter-offer in the remaining rounds if Alice changes her mind."
