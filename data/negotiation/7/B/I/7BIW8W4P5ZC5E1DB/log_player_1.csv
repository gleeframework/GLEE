Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
