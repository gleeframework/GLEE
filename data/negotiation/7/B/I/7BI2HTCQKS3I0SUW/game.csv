"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for your product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. Let's find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
