"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $78. Let's see if we can make this work.",78.0,Bob,4,
