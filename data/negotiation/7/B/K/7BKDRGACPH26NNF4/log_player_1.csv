"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my desired price and his perceived value. There's room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,000 is a good step, but it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While it's still below my initial target, $11,000 is a reasonable price and a significant profit over John's offer.
