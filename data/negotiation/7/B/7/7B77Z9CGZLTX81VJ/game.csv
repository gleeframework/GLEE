"Hello Alice, I appreciate the unique opportunity you're offering with the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I believe this reflects a fair valuation based on market standards and the potential benefits. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for this product. It's unique, and I'm confident its value will be realized in the market. To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and the potential return on investment, I would like to propose a price of $1250000. This price seems to strike a balance between our interests and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm looking for. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1650000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer and should allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we are close to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm grateful for your latest offer, Alice. It shows your flexibility and commitment to finding a solution. Given the value proposition and considering my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and could lead to a successful transaction for both parties.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
