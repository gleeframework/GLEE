,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about buying this product.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500 to make this deal work.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal.",12250.0,Bob,6,
