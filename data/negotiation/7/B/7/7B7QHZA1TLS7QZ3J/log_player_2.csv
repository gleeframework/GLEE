Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no point in risking further negotiation.  You'll get the best price by buying from John."
