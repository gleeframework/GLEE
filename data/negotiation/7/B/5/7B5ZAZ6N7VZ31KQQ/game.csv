"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and $900,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,025,000.  This reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is as high as I can go.  If you're unable to do that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
