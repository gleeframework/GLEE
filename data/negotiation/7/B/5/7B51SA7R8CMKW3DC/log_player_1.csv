"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above what Bob values the product at.  It's important to start high, but not too high, to avoid immediately ending the negotiation.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, which could make him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I could accept and secure a sale, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for a lower price this early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but this is my final offer.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* The message emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget, hoping to find a compromise.
*  I'm positioning this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000.  I'm still a bit outside my budget.  How about $825,000? This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but I'm still not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  There are still six rounds left, and I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $825,000 is tempting, I'm still committed to a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to go down to $840,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm countering with a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm flexible but not desperate.
* The message highlights the ""true value"" of the product to reinforce its worth.
* I'm emphasizing the ""significant concession"" to make my offer seem more attractive. 
* I'm focusing on the compromise aspect to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your commitment to the value of the product.  $840,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $830,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $830,000 is just $30,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we are in round 6 of 10.  Considering the potential for further negotiation breakdowns, and the option to sell to John for $800,000, accepting this offer seems like the best strategic move. 

It's a reasonable price, secures a sale, and minimizes the risk of further negotiation failures that could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
