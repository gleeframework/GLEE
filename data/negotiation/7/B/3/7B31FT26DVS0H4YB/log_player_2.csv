# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it would be a great addition to your operations.  Consider this my best offer, as I have another buyer lined up for $1,200,000 if you decide to pass. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
