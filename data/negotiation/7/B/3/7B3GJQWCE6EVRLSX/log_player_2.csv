"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you don't know the product's true value, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's still early in the negotiation.  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate and Alice is willing to come down.  There's still room to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
