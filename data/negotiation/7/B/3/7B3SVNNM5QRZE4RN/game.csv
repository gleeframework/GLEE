"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,800,000 for this to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
