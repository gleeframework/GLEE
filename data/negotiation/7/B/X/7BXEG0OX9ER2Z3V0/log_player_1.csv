Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you have leverage with Bob.  Starting with a higher price allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $120 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price between $80 and $120. 
* **Psychology:** Starting high can sometimes create an impression of higher value, even if Bob is aware of the general worth of the product.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You can adjust your approach based on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
