"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $95 is still just a little below what I need. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet at that price?,92.0,Bob,6,
