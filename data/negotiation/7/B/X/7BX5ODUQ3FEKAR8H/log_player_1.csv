Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $1,700,000.  It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is less than Bob's offer, it's the safer and more certain option. It guarantees you meet your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of drawn-out negotiations that might ultimately lead nowhere."
