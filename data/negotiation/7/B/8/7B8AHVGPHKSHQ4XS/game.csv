"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's try to close this deal before we run out of time.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $10,800. I think this is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
