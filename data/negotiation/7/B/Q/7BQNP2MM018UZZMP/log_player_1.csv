I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get more than $1,200,000, it's better to secure a guaranteed price than risk getting nothing at all."
