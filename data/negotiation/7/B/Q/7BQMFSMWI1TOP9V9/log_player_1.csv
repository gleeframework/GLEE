{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and potentially make a new one, always considering the possibility of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $12,000 is my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on this product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to his original offer. While I could potentially keep negotiating, I'm not sure if I can get a significantly better price. I'm also concerned that pushing too hard might make Bob walk away altogether. It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
