"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more in line with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $7,000?  That's a significant price difference and would be a good deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
