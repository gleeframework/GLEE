I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my desired price point, and I'm confident we can reach a more advantageous agreement. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,025,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my minimum acceptable range, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
