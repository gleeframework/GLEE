"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a significant counteroffer, showing Alice he's serious about negotiating.  $11,000 is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for further negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He wants to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to his target price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price. By offering $12,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product, but that he won't go any higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
