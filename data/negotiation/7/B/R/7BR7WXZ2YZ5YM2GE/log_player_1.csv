"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'd accept, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could sell to John for the same amount,  there's no benefit in doing so at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
