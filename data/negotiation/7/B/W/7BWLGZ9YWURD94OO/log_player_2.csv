You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer might be tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice (she might lower the price) or you can simply proceed to purchase from John at your desired price point."
