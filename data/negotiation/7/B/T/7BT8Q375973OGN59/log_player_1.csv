Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still allows me to make a profit. 

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, and hopefully, Bob will be agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, this is a good deal.  It's only slightly lower than my last counteroffer, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'm confident I can make up for this small difference in other ventures."
