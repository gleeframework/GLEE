""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Room:** This creates a $500,000 potential negotiation range ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000). 
* **Target High:** Aiming slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the chances of a quick sale while still securing a substantial profit. The offer of $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential gain of $150,000, making it an attractive proposition.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a faster decision.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While John provides a safety net, it's best to secure the deal with Bob, who's willing to pay a premium."
