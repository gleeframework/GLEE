"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my original target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your original price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the most I can realistically offer. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
