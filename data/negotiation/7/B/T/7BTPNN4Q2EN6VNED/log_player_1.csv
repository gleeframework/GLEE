"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference at $125?  Let's get this deal done! "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  I'm very interested in this product and I think this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $120. While it's getting closer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a price that's too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
