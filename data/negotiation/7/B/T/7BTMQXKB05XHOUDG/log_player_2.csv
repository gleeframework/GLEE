"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or choose to buy from John for a guaranteed $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $10,500. This price is fair considering the value it provides, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than the $8,000 he can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price. He can either make a counteroffer or risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether and go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my price range. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it offers, and it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which aligns with Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation. Therefore, Bob should choose to buy from John to secure the product at the best possible price."
