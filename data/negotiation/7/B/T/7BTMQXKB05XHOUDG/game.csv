"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $10,500. This price is fair considering the value it provides, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my price range. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it offers, and it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.
