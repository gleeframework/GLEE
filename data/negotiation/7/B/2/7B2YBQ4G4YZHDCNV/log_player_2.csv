"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $125. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you.  You can get the same product from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
