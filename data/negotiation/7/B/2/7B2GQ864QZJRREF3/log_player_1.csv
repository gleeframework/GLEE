"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'll be very interested in it.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's initial interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer shows interest, there's still room for a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a great price for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. 
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but not giving away too much. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.
* **Still room for negotiation:**  $7,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I have a few rounds left.
* **Potential for better offer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  John's offer of $8,000 is a good safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting more from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference and go with $7,600?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 7600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product again, subtly emphasizing that my price is still reasonable.
* **Positive and direct:** I'm keeping the message positive and direct, making it clear that I'm open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have four rounds remaining. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:** John's offer of $8,000 gives me a solid fallback if I can't get a better deal from Bob.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $7,500."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $7,400 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects its value, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 7400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that we're getting closer to a deal, encouraging Bob to finalize the purchase.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept my offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing that both of us stand to benefit from a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay within 3 days of receiving the product, which is a faster payment schedule than usual. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only two rounds remaining, and Bob hasn't budged much.
* **Unfavorable offer:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Guaranteed income:** Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, which is a safe and secure outcome.
* **Risk of lower offer:** If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a risk he'll counteroffer with a price even lower than $7,000, resulting in a loss for me. 

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to sell the product to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the potential risk of getting a lower offer from Bob."
