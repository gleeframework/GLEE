(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's significantly over your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm starting with the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Alice might reject this offer, but it establishes my baseline and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,400,000 is still too expensive. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I can offer a price closer to my maximum budget and see if Alice will meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, but I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a compromise, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still within my acceptable range."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,250,000 is still above my comfortable range. I believe we can still negotiate a lower price. By rejecting this offer, I can keep pushing for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly. I believe there's still room for further compromise. $1,050,000 is a reasonable middle ground that shows I'm serious about buying the product but still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly above my desired price point.  I'm committed to seeing if I can negotiate a lower price and get closer to my budget. With only a few rounds left, I'm not going to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm getting close to my limit.  I'm increasing my offer again to show Alice that I'm serious about buying, but $1,100,000 is my final offer. This is close enough to my budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept. If she rejects, I will have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice's offer is still above my desired price point. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to pay. It's better to take a guaranteed deal with John at $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget, rather than risking another round of negotiation that could end up costing me more."
