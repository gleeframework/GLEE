Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering the product at $12,000, we're gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, ensuring we don't lose out if Bob rejects the initial offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your minimum price or John's offer. In a real negotiation, information is key, and Bob might have his own strategies and information."
