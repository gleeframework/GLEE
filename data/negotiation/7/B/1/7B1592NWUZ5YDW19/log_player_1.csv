I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a decent margin while also being potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While I'm happy with $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $9,000 as a compromise. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'd rather sell to John for $8,000 than risk going lower and ending up with less."
