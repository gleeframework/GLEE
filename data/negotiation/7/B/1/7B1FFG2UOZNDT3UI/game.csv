"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,92.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  I'm still not comfortable with that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.75? It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",88.75,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,95.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $88.75, which would be $90.625. Let me see if we can make a deal at this price.",90.625,Alice,5,,
