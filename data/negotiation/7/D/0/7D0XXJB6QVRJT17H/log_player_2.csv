It's always best to start by rejecting the initial offer and seeing if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate. You're still within your 10 round limit and John's offer is a strong backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to push the price down, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,012,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still struggling to justify $1,012,500. Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,050,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is still unwilling to go down to your target price.  Since you've already had 6 rounds and John is offering you the product at your target price, it's best to go with John.  You'll save $50,000 and avoid further negotiations."
