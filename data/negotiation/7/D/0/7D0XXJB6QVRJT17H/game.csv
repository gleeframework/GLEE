"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to push the price down, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,012,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still struggling to justify $1,012,500. Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,050,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
