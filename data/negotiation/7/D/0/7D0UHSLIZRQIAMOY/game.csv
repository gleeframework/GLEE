"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while providing you with a valuable asset. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
