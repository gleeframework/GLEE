"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he can get a better deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to foster a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I explicitly state my willingness to negotiate, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while providing you with a valuable asset. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell at a significant loss.
* **Reasoning:** I explain my reasoning for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and my need for a fair profit. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I use language like ""bridge the gap"" to emphasize my willingness to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can find a price closer to $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your latest offer. It's getting closer, but I need to ensure I can recoup my investment. How about $1,450,000? This price acknowledges your perspective and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's settle on this and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a continued willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I use language like ""settle on this"" and ""finalize the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I briefly reiterate my need for a reasonable profit to justify the price.
* **Time Constraint:**  While not explicitly mentioned, I'm aware of the limited rounds and aiming for a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the negotiation we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John at a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is my goal. It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
