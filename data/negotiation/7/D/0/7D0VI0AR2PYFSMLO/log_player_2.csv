"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $115. It's a good offer, but I can likely get it for less.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant price reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still going to reject the offer. I'm confident I can get it lower, and I don't want to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

I'll increase my offer slightly to $107. It's a small step up from my previous offer, but I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $108. This is only $3 over my ideal price, and I've already rejected a couple of offers.  It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of either her getting more stubborn or me running out of rounds and having to buy from John."
