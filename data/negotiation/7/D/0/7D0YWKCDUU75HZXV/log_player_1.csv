"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,600,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $1520000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,520,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,520,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,580,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1580000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced $1580000 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $1550000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,550,000 is a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is not a good option at this point, as I can secure a higher price from Bob."
