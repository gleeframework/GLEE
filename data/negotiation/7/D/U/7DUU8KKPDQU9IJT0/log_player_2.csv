"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is far too high for his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,000,000 is still more than he's willing to pay.  He can continue to negotiate with Alice, as he's getting closer to his goal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid wasting any more time."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept the offer.  $950,000 is still within his budget, and he's getting closer to his desired price.  He has no guarantee that he'll get a better offer in the next round, and he's already spent several rounds negotiating.  It's a good deal for both parties."
