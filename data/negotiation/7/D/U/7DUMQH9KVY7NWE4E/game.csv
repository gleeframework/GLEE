"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's not even covering my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you accept this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
