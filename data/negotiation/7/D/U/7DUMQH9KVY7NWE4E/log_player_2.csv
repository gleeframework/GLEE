Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to reject her offer and counter with a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's not even covering my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target. I'm going to try to negotiate further.  I'm not going to buy from John yet because I'm hopeful we can reach a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, but it's getting close. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'll buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you accept this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
