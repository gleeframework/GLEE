Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $900,000 is too low, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's not even covering my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer and propose $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll see if I can negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you accept this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While I'd love to get more, the risk of losing the deal entirely is high.  It's best to accept his offer and close the deal."
