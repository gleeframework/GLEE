"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in something that provides a significant return. I'm happy to consider your product at $700000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the return on investment, but I believe this product has tremendous potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820000. This price still reflects its true value, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $820000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to land closer to $750000. This price allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us while ensuring the deal is beneficial for both parties. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $780000. This price is still a good value for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the potential in this product.",780000.0,Alice,5,
