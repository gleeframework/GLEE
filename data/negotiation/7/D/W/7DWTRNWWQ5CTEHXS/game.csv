"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,
