"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Bob has a maximum budget of $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 saves him $1,000.
* **Alice's offer is still within Bob's budget:**  The price of $14,000 is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy for Bob, as it allows him to acquire the product while saving money."
