{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $170.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $150. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my $150 target, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $145. This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
