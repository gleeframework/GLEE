"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to stick to my budget. My final offer is $800,000.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
