Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it might seem excessive, it establishes the product's potential value in Bob's mind.
* **Negotiation Room:** The high price leaves ample room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, leading to a back-and-forth that could still land you a price significantly higher than his initial valuation.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This strong fallback position allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and are willing to negotiate. If you need to sell the product quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing price to Bob might be a better approach."
