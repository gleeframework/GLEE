{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential negotiation while still securing a profit. 
* The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" and ""discount"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* This strategy aims to get Bob to accept the offer.  If he rejects it, I can still negotiate further while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close a deal, I can't afford to lose that much money. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's a compromise that could potentially be accepted.
* **The message:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal, but reiterate the need for a price that covers my costs. I emphasize the ""substantial discount"" to make my offer seem more appealing.

This strategy aims to:
*  Secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
*  Keep the negotiation moving forward without losing the chance to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted by the idea of closing a deal, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can secure a better deal.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price point. If it fails, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $950,000 doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's the best I can do.  If you're still interested, please let me know."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This is the last possible price I'm willing to accept before selling to John. It's a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.
* **The message:** I emphasize that this is a ""final concession"" and ""the best I can do"" to create urgency and make Bob feel like he has to act.  The tone is still respectful, but firm.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.** 
* **Potentially get Bob to accept the offer, knowing he's close to his budget limit.**
* **Offer a clear ""last chance"" to avoid the risk of losing the deal to John.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Considering that:

* I've already made several concessions,
* Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,""
* There's a risk of him walking away and me losing the deal entirely,

It's in my best interest to accept the offer. While I'm not getting my full asking price, $1,000,000 is a substantial profit and a much better outcome than losing the deal altogether or having to settle for John's lower offer."
