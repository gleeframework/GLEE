"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. Would you like to accept or make a counteroffer?",180.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $155. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $140 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,145.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $145.",145.0,Alice,5,,
