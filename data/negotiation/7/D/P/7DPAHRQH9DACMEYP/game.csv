"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay  $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your potential profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,600,000 represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000,  which represents a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see we are getting closer.  While $1,150,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 to close this deal quickly. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
