Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Showing confidence by starting high can help you secure a good price.

Keep in mind that you'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either counteroffer or move on to John."
