"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) to give myself some wiggle room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $150 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $150. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's exactly halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving away the product for a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $162.5. I would like to offer you $155 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is a good deal for me.  While it's not the ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and avoids further negotiation.  I'm also running the risk of Bob walking away entirely, so accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
