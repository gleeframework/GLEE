"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120.  Since Bob can get the same product from John for $100, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
