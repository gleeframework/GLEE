{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate and get a better price.  $600,000 is a significant amount of money, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down closer to my ideal price. I'm assuming Alice might be willing to negotiate, and this counteroffer should make her realize that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is a good price, it's still quite high. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further, given her previous counteroffer. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. This middle ground might be more appealing to Alice than my previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price range, and we're now only $50,000 apart. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  I'm confident that I can save more money in the long run by acquiring the product from Alice.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
