Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to pay $78 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5

Alice's offer is just above your price range. It's not worth continuing to negotiate for a small difference. You can get the product from John for $80, which is your maximum budget."
