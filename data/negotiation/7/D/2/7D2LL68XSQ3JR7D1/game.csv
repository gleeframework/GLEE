"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you and my initial offer.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to pay $78 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",78.0,Bob,4,
