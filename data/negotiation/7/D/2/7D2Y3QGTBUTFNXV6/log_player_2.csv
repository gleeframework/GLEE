"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are only willing to pay up to $800,000, so you should reject the offer and make a counteroffer.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. Could you consider a price of $1,000,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than your budget. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical choice. You have a good chance of getting a better price through continued negotiation."
