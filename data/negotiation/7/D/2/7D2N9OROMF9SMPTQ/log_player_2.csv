"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to Alice's perceived value. This aggressive initial offer might lead to a quick agreement, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still attempting to get a better price.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between his desired price and Alice's last offer. This keeps the negotiation moving without risking a complete breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower, and there's always a risk of her walking away from the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a further increase or losing the deal completely."
