Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, making that your absolute floor.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a strong chance of securing a sale above your minimum, maximizing your profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes limited information about Bob's negotiating style and no time pressure.  Depending on the context, adjustments might be necessary."
