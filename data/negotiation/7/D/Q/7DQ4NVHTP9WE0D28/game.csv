"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal happen. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we're both seeing in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
