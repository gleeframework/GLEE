# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,300,000 is far above his maximum budget of $800,000. He needs to counteroffer and try to bring the price down."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $800,000."
