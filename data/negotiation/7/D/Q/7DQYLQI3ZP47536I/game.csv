"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $550,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a reasonable return on my investment. I can offer the product to you for $500,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",500000.0,Alice,5,
