# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  It's worth more than that to me, but I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
