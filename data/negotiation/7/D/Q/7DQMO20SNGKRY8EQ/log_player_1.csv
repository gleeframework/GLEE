Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob sees the value at $1,500,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.  Any price within this range could work.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed sale with John, giving you a strong position.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to maximize your potential profit. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to give more negotiating room.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly less aggressive approach.

**After the Offer**

Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Have a strategy for concessions.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob won't meet a price above your minimum, you have John as a safety net."
