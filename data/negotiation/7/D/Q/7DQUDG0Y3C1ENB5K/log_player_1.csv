"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is simply unacceptable.  I'll counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I believe this price is a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is not a price I can accept.  I will counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, and I'm hoping it will finally be acceptable to Bob.  I'm also starting to run out of time, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is becoming a more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  To secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further rejections, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
