"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, reflecting the significant value I know this product holds. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value of this product for your business.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,212,500? This price is a fair reflection of the value this product will bring to your business, and it allows us both to move forward. Let me know what you think.",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,212,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something under $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,190,000 to finalize the deal?",1190000.0,Bob,6,
