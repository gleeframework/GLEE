Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1.5 million?** I'm aiming high, hoping to maximize my profits. 
* **The risk:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. 
* **The backup:**  However, even if he does, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1 million. This means I'm taking a calculated risk with the potential for a significant reward. 

I'm hoping Bob values the product at more than $1.5 million, but I'm comfortable with the backup option of selling to John."
