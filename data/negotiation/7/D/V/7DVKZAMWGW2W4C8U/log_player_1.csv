Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price. How about $110?  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $110, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to buy.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him, which might incentivize him to accept.
* **Strategy:** This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. It's a good starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can always go with John for $80."
