"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can potentially save money by negotiating.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have, but it's not the best deal.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This starts the negotiation process, aiming to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into creating it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a good deal.** It's still lower than your fallback option of buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.** You could end up paying more or losing the deal altogether.
* **Accepting the offer secures a good price.** This ensures you get the product while saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
