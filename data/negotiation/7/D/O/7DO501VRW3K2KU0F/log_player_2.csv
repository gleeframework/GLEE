"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  $12,000 is still a lot more than the product is worth to Alice. He should try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to get a better value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price.  $11,000 is still above the product's value to Alice. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to reach a price closer to $9,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for the compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is a good deal for him.  He can get the product for $10,500, which is significantly less than what John is selling it for.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his offer and he might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price."
