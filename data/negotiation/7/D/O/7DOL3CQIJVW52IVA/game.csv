,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $105 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's make this happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $100. That way we both get something we're happy with. ",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's try $97. It's a fair price for both of us, and it will help us close the deal.",97.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned here. I really want to make this deal work, but we're getting closer to my bottom line.  $99 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. ",99.0,Alice,7,
