Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement on price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my reach.  I can offer up to $800,000 for this product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he is unwilling to budge beyond his valuation of $800,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer. Accepting his final offer represents a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut negotiations short and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
