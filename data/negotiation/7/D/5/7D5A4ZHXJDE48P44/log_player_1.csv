Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand he's interested,  $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below a certain price point."

I'm selling the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, his final offer is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John."
