"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I see the value in the product, $13,000 is still too high for me. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the movement.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still can't justify $11,500. My final offer is $10,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
