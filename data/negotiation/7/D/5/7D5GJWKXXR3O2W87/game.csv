"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm looking for a price that reflects its value. I'm starting at $1,750,000.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped,  I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. How about $1,400,000? This would still be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,300,000. Would that work for you?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. However,  $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up slightly to $1,350,000? This would be a good compromise, and a fair price for this valuable product. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
