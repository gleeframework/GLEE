Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider a deal that could be beneficial to both parties."
