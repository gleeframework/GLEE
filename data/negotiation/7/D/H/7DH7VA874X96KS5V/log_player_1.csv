Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $12,250 is better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
