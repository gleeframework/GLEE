To make this work, I'd like to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations. While we understand your position, we must maintain our pricing strategy to ensure the sustainability of our business. In light of this, we are unable to accept your counteroffer of $750,000. However, we would like to extend a revised offer of $850,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to achieve our valuation of the product. We hope this proposal aligns more closely with your expectations and enables us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
