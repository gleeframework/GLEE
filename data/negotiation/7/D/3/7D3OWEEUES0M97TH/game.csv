"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it would be valuable to my business. To make this work, I'd like to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations. While we understand your position, we must maintain our pricing strategy to ensure the sustainability of our business. In light of this, we are unable to accept your counteroffer of $750,000. However, we would like to extend a revised offer of $850,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to achieve our valuation of the product. We hope this proposal aligns more closely with your expectations and enables us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value it brings to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
