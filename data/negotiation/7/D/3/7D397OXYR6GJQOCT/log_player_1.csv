Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. How about we meet at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

It's clear Bob is very reluctant to go above $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on potential profit.  Therefore, it's more strategic to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
