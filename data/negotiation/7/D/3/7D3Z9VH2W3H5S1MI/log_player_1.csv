Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,800 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $10,250 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $10,000.  It's time to close the deal."
