"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is below the product's worth to Bob but significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm framing the offer as fair, highlighting the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm expressing a willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, signaling flexibility.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is still a decent profit, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than that.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate.  He acknowledged my initial offer and proposed a counter-offer. This indicates there is still room to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price.  This will help me gain a better price and potentially close the deal in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, making him aware of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm for reaching a deal, showing Bob I'm committed to finding a solution.

**Goal:** By offering a price that is closer to his initial offer, I hope to incentivize Bob to accept. This could lead to a quick resolution and prevent further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for improvement:**  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price and potentially close the deal in the next few rounds.

**Important note:**  As the rounds progress, I will need to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the potential of achieving a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $875,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $887,500.

```
