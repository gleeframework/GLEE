{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher.  
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""value and potential"" and mentioning a ""return on investment,"" you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $2,000,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. However, it's generally best to start high and negotiate down.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a less aggressive starting point."
