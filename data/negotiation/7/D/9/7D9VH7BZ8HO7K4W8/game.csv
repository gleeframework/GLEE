"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is much higher. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about $8500? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, so I'll offer $7750. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8200? It's a compromise that's closer to your target price, but still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $7500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,6,
