"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but it's still below my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Fairness:** I mention ""fair price"" to subtly suggest that this is a good deal for him. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll be paying attention to Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, so there's room for negotiation. I can try to get closer to my desired price in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get more if possible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.  I'll aim for a price that is attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $7,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and still allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Discount:** I emphasize the ""significant discount"" from my initial price to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Covering Costs:** I subtly mention covering my costs to remind Bob that this is still a profitable deal for me. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a better price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still room to get a little more.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I'm not willing to give up on getting closer to my target price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to close the deal without losing too much.  I'll aim for a price that is acceptable to Bob while still maximizing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  Your offer of $9,000 is very tempting, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Emphasizing ""Great Deal"":**  I frame the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and value.
* **Keeping the Pressure On:**  While I'm willing to go down a bit, I'm not giving up on getting a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a significant move towards Bob's offer, but it still keeps me within a range that's profitable for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll have to reconsider my options and potentially start moving towards selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm not ready to settle just yet.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I don't want to rush into a deal that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  There's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value, but acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  I'll need to be persuasive and demonstrate flexibility while still trying to secure a good price. If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as time is running out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to show a commitment to closing the deal.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm reiterating the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by stating ""Let's close this deal,"" encouraging Bob to make a decision. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to secure a price closer to my desired value while still being within a reasonable range for Bob. I'm hoping that the combination of a final concession, emphasis on fairness, and urgency will sway Bob to accept the offer. 

**If Bob rejects, I'll be forced to consider selling to John in the next round.** This is my last chance to get a price that's significantly higher than John's offer, so I'll need to be persuasive and convince Bob that this is a deal he can't refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to continue negotiating.
* **Bob's Final Offer is Too Low:**  While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable settling for a price that's significantly below what I believe the product is worth.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe and guaranteed way to make a profit.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses.  While I hoped for a higher price from Bob, I'm not willing to risk missing out on a guaranteed $10,000, especially with limited time remaining.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
