"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $2,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has room to bargain. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he starts by offering $1,000 less than Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Bob also uses a friendly tone to maintain a positive relationship with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Accepting the offer at $9,500 saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Risk:** There's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice might not budge further, or even raise the price. This could force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Overall, accepting the offer is the most logical choice for Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price while minimizing risk."
