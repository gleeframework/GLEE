Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that $950,000 is a fair price for the product given its value. I would like to stick with that figure. Let me know what you think.

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
