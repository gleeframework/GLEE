Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, even potentially settling somewhere above my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A high initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. If I had more information, I might adjust my approach."
