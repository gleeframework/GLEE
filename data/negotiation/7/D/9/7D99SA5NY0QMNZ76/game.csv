"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you including the product details. While I'm interested, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $87.50.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit too high at $87.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",86.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I was thinking that $86.25 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you halfway again and offer $88.75. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",88.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $88.75.  Let's try $87.  That's right in the middle of our last two offers, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $88, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me.",88.0,Alice,7,
