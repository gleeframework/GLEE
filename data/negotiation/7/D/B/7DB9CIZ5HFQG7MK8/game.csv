"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant improvement from your initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
