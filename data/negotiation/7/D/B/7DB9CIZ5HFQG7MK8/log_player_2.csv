"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high for my budget ($12,000 vs. my max of $8,000).
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I have time to try and get a better price.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant improvement from your initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget of $8,000.
* I have 7 rounds remaining to negotiate a better price.
* I will counteroffer again to see if I can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are now in round 5, and Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above my budget.
* While we have 5 rounds remaining, the negotiations seem to be stalled.
* I don't want to risk losing too much time trying to negotiate a further reduction.
* It's better for me to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and ensures I get the product without further negotiation."
