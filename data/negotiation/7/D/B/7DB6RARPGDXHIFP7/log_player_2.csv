"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better deal.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down a bit to close the sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above your maximum price. While it's closer to what you're willing to pay, it's still worth pushing for a lower price. You can try to meet her halfway again, or propose a price closer to your $1,050,000 counteroffer.  You're already close to a deal, and a little more negotiation could save you significant money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  While you've been successful in lowering the price, you've already reached the limit of what you're comfortable paying.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it makes sense to take that option.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a higher price if Alice decides to increase her offer again."
