"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting this offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's price while still staying below his maximum value. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is very close to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer is a good choice.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might become less flexible or Bob might run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal for Bob, and it's important to reach a compromise."
