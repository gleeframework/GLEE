"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.  How about $11,500? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $10,750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to pay it if you're willing to sell it to me at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
