"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his budget and can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000.  This is a reasonable compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, it's enough to entice him to accept, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to $900,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be keeping an eye on John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $925,000.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway again, but I'm getting closer to my ideal price point.  If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a little anxious, I still think I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to push him up just a bit more. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to John's offer and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely. I'm hoping that this is a compromise that he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  It's getting very close to the end of the negotiations and I'm worried about losing Bob altogether.  While $800,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
