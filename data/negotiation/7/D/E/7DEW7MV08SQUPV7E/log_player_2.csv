Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I really want to see this product in your hands.  What do you say?

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has come down significantly.  While you might squeeze out a few more dollars, it's getting close to the point where it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
