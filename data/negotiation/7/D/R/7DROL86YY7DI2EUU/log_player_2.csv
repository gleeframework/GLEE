"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  This offer stands for 24 hours. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, knowing you have John's offer as a fallback option."
