Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you think the product is worth more to you, but I'm still not willing to pay more than $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Bob is clearly anchored at $80 and isn't budging. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum. Accepting his offer is a loss, and further rounds risk wasting time I could use to find a different buyer. John offers a sure $100, which is a better outcome."
