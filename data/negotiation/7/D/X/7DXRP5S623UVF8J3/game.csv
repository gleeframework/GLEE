"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
