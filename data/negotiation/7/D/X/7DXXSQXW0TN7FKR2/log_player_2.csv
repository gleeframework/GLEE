Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already willing to give up some profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice has met your bottom line.  There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or going with John, as both options result in the same price."
