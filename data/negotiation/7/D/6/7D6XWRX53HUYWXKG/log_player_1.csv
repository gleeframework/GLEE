Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product for $110 gives Bob a good deal (saving $10) while maximizing your potential profit. You leave a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale and have to accept the lower offer from John."
