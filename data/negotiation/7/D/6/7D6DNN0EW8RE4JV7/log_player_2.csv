Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $200 really is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price for the value it offers. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and you're welcome to consider other options.

It's clear Alice is unwilling to budge from $200.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better price and will just waste time. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $80."
