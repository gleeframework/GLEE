"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a good price, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to secure the sale."
