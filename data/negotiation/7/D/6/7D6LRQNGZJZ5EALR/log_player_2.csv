"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us. To start, I'm offering it to you for $900000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a reasonable strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is a good price, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above your target price of $800,000. You are closer to your target price, but there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better price without committing to something you're not comfortable with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 825000}
