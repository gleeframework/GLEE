"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us. To start, I'm offering it to you for $900000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is a good price, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",825000.0,Bob,4,
