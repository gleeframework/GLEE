"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I appreciate your understanding.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $10,500 is a bit steep for me. Could we possibly negotiate down to $10,000? That would be the most I could afford while still getting a good deal on this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
