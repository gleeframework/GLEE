"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the product has value, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $900,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
