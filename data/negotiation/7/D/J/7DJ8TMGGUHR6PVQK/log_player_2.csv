"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you $50,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice."
