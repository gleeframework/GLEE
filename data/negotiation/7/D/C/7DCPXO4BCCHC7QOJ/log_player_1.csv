Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer that leaves you a good profit margin while being enticing to Bob. It's significantly less than your backup offer and gives him a reason to consider it seriously.
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and positions the price as a starting point for discussion, potentially leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle."
