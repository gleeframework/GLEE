Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

My reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and slightly below Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to his maximum. 
* **Justification:** I'm implying the product's value to Bob without stating a specific reason. This encourages him to reveal his own valuation during the negotiation.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $80, I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob with strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not willing to go above $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is a significant jump from my initial ask of $130, but it's still a decent profit above my minimum of $80. However, his firm statement about not going above $100 suggests there might be room to push him a little further. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can secure a slightly better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for a product you'll clearly get a lot of use out of."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By suggesting $115, I'm aiming for a price above the midpoint between his offer ($100) and my previous ask ($130). This keeps the negotiation moving in my favor. 
* **John in Mind:** I'm still mindful of John's standing $80 offer, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $115. How about we try $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $110 is a solid profit margin ($30) over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Upside:** While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, his firm stance suggests it would be difficult and potentially jeopardize the deal.  
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit."
