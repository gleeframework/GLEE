Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is greater than your minimum price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counter-offer, giving you room to earn more.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A lower price could make Bob think you're desperate to sell and encourage a very low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's closer to your minimum, it's still below the $100 you're willing to accept. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:** Since Bob is interested and willing to negotiate, there's a chance you can get a higher price by counter-offering. 

**Next Steps:** You'll counter-offer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $122. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:**  $122 is only $3 less than your initial offer of $125, and it's well above your minimum of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving you with only the $100 offer from John.

By accepting this offer, you maximize your profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
