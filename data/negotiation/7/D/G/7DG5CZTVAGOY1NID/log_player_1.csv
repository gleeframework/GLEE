``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my own, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,500 as the price for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, but I'll need to come up with a counteroffer that's more appealing to me."
