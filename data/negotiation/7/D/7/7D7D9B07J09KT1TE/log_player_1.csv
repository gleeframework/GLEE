"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Flexibility:**  Leaving space to negotiate helps me avoid a quick rejection and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for $9,000 just yet.
* **Strategic Approach:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to continue negotiating. This can potentially make Bob more willing to compromise in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering the value of this product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm reducing my price to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial value.
* **Justified Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to show that my price is justified.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by making a counteroffer, but I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'd like to propose an alternative: $9800. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Still Below Target:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price, but $9,800 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I believe we can still bridge the gap. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and am willing to push for a better deal. 
* **Time is on My Side:** With several rounds remaining, I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable price without risking a sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  While $9,800 is getting closer,  I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer the product for $10,150. That's a significant compromise on my part. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that is the average of our last two offers.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm making a significant compromise to show my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** With the number of rounds dwindling, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to come to an agreement.
* **Balance:**  This offer leaves a small margin for further negotiation if necessary, but is closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose an alternative: $9500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** Bob's offer is still well below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  While we're getting closer, I'm not willing to accept a price that low.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to keep pressing for a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and am willing to risk losing this deal if it means getting a better price.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer in the next round, especially as I'm actively trying to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Last Concession:** I'm reducing my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, I'm increasing pressure on Bob to agree to a reasonable price.
* **Potential for Agreement:** While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession. However, $10000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose an offer of $9750. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the End:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process.  
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer is only slightly better than his previous offer.  The potential gain is minimal.
* **Time is Critical:** With only two rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that we can reach an agreement.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of losing this deal entirely.

**Conclusion:** 

While I would prefer to maximize my profit, the risk of further negotiation and a potential failed deal outweighs the potential gain from accepting Bob's final offer.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
