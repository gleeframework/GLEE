"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Could you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10500, considering the value of this product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'd like to propose an alternative: $9800. Could you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  While $9800 is getting closer,  I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer the product for $10150. That's a significant compromise on my part. What do you think? ",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose an alternative: $9500. Could you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession. However, $10000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose an offer of $9750. Could you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,8,
