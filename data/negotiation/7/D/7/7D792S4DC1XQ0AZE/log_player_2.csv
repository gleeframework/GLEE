"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000.  Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is significantly closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a chance to get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to $850,000, his previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's offer.  $860,000 is a compromise that is closer to Alice's value, but still provides Bob with a decent saving compared to the initial price or John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price and is now offering $870,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it's within his budget and closer to his desired price.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is high.  Therefore, accepting the offer in this round is the most logical choice."
