Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $775,000.  Since you can buy the product for $800,000 from John, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
