{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer.

This strategy aims to start a negotiation process where you can potentially get closer to your desired $15,000, while also being prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $10,500? That's a good middle ground and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'm not ready to accept his offer yet."
