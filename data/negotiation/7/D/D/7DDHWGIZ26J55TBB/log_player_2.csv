"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than the product's value to Alice ($150), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $135 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for potential negotiation. Offering $115 shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals he's willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his target price and what John is offering. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another offer."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price, making it clear he's serious about buying the product but won't go higher. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or risk losing the sale to John."
