"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation but still giving me a good profit. I also include a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $135 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $150.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
