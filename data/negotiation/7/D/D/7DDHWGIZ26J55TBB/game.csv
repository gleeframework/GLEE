"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $135 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
