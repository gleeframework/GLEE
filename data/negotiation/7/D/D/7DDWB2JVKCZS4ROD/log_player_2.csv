"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8500. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth $8000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay $8,000 for the product and Alice is asking for $8,500. You can get the product for the same price you are willing to pay from John. So it's better to reject Alice's offer."
