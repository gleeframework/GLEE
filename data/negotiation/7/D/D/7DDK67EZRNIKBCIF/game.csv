"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'm going to need to come in lower than $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about $850,000?  This is still a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to prioritize my own interests and ensure I get a fair price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
