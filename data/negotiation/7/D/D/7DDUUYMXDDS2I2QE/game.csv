"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is fair considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $125? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more offer. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle again? I'll offer you $115. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",115.0,Alice,5,
