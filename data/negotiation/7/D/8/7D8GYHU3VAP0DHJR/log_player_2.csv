# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure a high-quality item that could be worth $12,000 to you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get the product for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. In light of this, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer but still reflects its true value. I hope this proposal works for you, and please let me know if you need further consideration.
