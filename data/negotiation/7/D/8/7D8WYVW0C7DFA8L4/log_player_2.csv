Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want to pay, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm not going to cave yet.  We're close to the end of the negotiation, and there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us."

Alice is not budging, and we are down to the last round.  While I'd love to save more money, I don't want to risk losing the product altogether. Buying from John is a safe bet.  It's a bit pricier, but at least I'm guaranteed to get the product."
