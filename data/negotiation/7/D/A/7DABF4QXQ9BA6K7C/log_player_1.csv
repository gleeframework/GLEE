While I'm keen to find a price that works for us both,  $1,050,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that justifies continuing the negotiation over a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
