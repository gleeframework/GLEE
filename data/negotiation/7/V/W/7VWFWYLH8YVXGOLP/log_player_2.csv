"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better than $1,400,000. He has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a good profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1250000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1325000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've mentioned it holds for you. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a solid offer that demonstrates my commitment to buying the product from you, while still remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1315000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I believe the product's value is worth more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,315,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product.
