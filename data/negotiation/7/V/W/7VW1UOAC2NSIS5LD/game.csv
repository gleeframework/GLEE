"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $120, would you be interested in negotiating from there?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $130.  It's closer to your offer, but still within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a great product, and I think it's worth more than what you're offering. Let's see if we can make a deal at $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference at $135. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $145. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Alice,7,
