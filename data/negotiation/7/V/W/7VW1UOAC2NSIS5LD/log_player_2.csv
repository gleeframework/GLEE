{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double the price you're willing to pay.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $120, would you be interested in negotiating from there?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a little high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $130.  It's closer to your offer, but still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a great product, and I think it's worth more than what you're offering. Let's see if we can make a deal at $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $140 is tempting, it's still above your budget and you have time to keep negotiating. You're closer to your goal, but you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference at $135. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $145. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is not budging much and it's getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $100.  You'll save money and avoid further negotiation."
