Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,262,500. This price reflects a fair balance between your desired selling price and my budget. I believe this offer represents a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a mutually agreeable deal. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and while it's tempting, I believe the product's intrinsic value warrants a slightly higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,295,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents an exceptional opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset."",
