"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and your understanding of the product's value.  However,  $1,200,000 undervalues its true potential and the returns it can generate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This represents a fair compromise, reflecting both its intrinsic worth and our mutual interest in a successful deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,262,500. This price reflects a fair balance between your desired selling price and my budget. I believe this offer represents a mutually beneficial agreement.",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a mutually agreeable deal. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and while it's tempting, I believe the product's intrinsic value warrants a slightly higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,295,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents an exceptional opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset.",1295000.0,Alice,5,
