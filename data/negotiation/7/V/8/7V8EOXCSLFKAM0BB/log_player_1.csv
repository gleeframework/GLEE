Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob.  I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning that I think he'll like the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I need to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand $100 is a lot lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a great deal for a product you'll love, and it gives us both room to agree."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm trying to be reasonable while also highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not giving up on getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? That's a good price for you, and I'm still getting a fair amount for my product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm trying to close the deal by meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that is still above my minimum but closer to his offer.  I'm also emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us."
