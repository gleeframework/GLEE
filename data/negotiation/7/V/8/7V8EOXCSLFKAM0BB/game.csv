"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $100 is a lot lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a great deal for a product you'll love, and it gives us both room to agree.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? That's a good price for you, and I'm still getting a fair amount for my product. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
