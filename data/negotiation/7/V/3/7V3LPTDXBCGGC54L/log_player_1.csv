Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your $12,000 value as possible. Offering it just below this at $11,999 maximizes potential profit.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position. There's no risk of getting stuck with the product.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also positions the product as potentially very valuable. 
* **Slight Discount Psychology:** The $11,999 price uses the ""just below"" psychological tactic. It might feel more appealing to Bob than a round $12,000."
