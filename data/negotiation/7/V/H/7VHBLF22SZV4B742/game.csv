"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be completely transparent with you, I have another offer for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty about the other offer, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to the original offer as I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Alice,5,
