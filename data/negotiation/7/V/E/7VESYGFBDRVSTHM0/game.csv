"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. Considering its worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. This price is fair and reasonable considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. My new offer is $11,000 for the product. I think this price is more in line with what you're looking for, and it's still a good deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, which would be $10,750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,750 is closer, I'm still hoping for a final adjustment. I'm willing to go up to $10,625 for the product. It's a small difference, but it's the most I can offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. ",10625.0,Bob,8,
