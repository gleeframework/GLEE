"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is significantly more than the product's value to you ($15,000). 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  While John's price is your limit, it's better to try and negotiate with Alice first to see if you can get a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. Considering its worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.
