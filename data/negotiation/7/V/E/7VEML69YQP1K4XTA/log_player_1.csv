Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate.

This approach balances the need to earn the most money with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price for me.  
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum acceptable price, but it also means missing out on the possibility of a higher offer from Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would give us both a good deal and help us move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive message:** The message highlights the benefits of accepting the offer for both of us, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still standing firm on my minimum acceptable price and not offering anything lower than $1,150,000. 

This approach balances the need to get a better price than Bob's offer with the desire to reach an agreement quickly to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
