Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,000,000, so this offer is higher.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's $50,000  between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It demonstrates you're serious:** By offering a price close to your minimum, you show you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point. The negotiation will depend on Bob's reaction and how you assess his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  While it's acceptable, it doesn't leave any room for profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a gap between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 with John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  This price still allows you to make a profit and is above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to meet you halfway. 

By offering a price slightly lower than your previous one, you show flexibility while still aiming for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  While you could counteroffer again, it's unlikely Bob will come up much further. 
* **Guaranteed Safety Net:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is your minimum and ensures you won't lose money.

It's better to accept John's offer and guarantee a profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet your minimum requirements."
