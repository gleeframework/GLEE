Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to his $1,200,000 value.
* **It shows you're serious:**  Offering a price that's not too low shows you're not desperate to sell and are confident in the product's worth. 

Keep in mind: You can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly but not too much. You want to maximize your profit while still keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** While it's lower than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $1,000,000. This means you're not losing money by rejecting.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value. 
* **Selling to John is a less favorable outcome:**  You can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John would mean missing out on potential profit.

**Next Step:**  You should send Bob a counteroffer that's somewhere between $1,100,000 and your initial $1,150,000. This will show you're willing to compromise but still value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between your initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, suggesting that the price reflects its worth.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  This counteroffer doesn't drastically lower your asking price, showing you still believe in the product's value and aren't desperate to sell.

**Remember:**  Be prepared to adjust your counteroffer depending on Bob's response. If he rejects again, you might consider lowering the price slightly. However, if he seems more willing to negotiate, you can try holding firm.  The goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is above your minimum:**  While it's lower than your desired price, it's still above your minimum of $1,000,000. This means you're not losing money by accepting.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price. There's a chance he might refuse your counteroffer, and you'd be forced to either accept a lower price or sell to John.
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiating can be time-consuming and draining. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations.

**Ultimately:** It's a calculated risk.  You're sacrificing some potential profit for a quicker sale and a more guaranteed outcome."
