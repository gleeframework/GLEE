"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **You can still make a profit:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and you can buy it for $1,200,000. This means you'll make a profit of $300,000.

While you could reject Alice's offer, you'd end up paying more to John, so accepting Alice's offer is the financially smarter choice."
