{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum.** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This helps avoid confusion and makes it easier for Bob to respond.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Remember, you can always adjust your offer or sell to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $15,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's above Bob's last offer but below your ideal price.** This shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This ensures Bob understands your position and encourages a quick response.

By making this counteroffer, you're showing flexibility and demonstrating your willingness to reach an agreement. This approach increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise:

* **It's closer to your minimum valuation than Bob's last offer.** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate.** This helps build a positive relationship with Bob for future interactions.

Given the uncertainty of future negotiations and the risk of Bob declining further counteroffers, accepting this offer maximizes your potential gain. You can always try to negotiate for a higher price in future deals, but it's important to secure a profitable sale when the opportunity presents itself."
