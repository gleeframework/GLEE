"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to pay more than your absolute maximum. By rejecting Alice's offer, you force yourself to consider the more economical option."
