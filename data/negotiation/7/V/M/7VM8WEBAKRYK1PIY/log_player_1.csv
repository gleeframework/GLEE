"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum value of $150.  I'm hoping Bob is interested and will counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum value. While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is a good outcome.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for the same amount."
