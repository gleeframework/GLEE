"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair, as it's still significantly higher than your valuation of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still fair, given the value the product holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price, as it's still significantly more than what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
