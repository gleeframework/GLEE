Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a one-time price of $100. I believe it provides significant value, but let me know if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows for potential negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""one-time price"") without directly suggesting Bob can negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's value aims to justify the higher price, even though we know Bob values it at $80.
* **Backup Option:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes we have one chance to offer Bob a price. If we could negotiate over multiple rounds, the approach might change."
