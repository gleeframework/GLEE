{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product. While a higher price might be achievable, the difference is becoming less significant with each round. Accepting his offer of $1,320,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
