{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I know the product is worth at least $100 to me.  While his offer is fair to him, it's not beneficial enough for me to accept. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price considering we both value the product highly."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose an offer of $105. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum threshold of $100 and represents a good compromise.  Further negotiation might yield a higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially losing the sale altogether is too high. Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a reasonable profit."
