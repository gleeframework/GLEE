"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,400,000, but I'm looking to save even more. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This price would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to get a great deal and you to still make a profit.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your desire to save even more, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,350,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1,380,000? This is a compromise that still allows you to get a great deal, while also recognizing the value of the product to you. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,365,000? This is a fair price that still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a substantial saving.  What do you think?",1365000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $1,365,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. How about we meet at $1,375,000? This is a price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also acknowledging your desire for a good deal. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
