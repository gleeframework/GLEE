"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,050,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver a strong return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  While $975,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,012,000 as a final offer. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.
