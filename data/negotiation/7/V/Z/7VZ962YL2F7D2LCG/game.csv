"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can work something out.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $125? That's my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
