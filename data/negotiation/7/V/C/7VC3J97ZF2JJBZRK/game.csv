"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair and reasonable offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  your offer of $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I understand that's a bit above your budget, but I'm confident the product's value is worth more to you than that. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I placed on the product and the benefits it will bring you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, $975,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This represents a further compromise on my end, and I believe we're getting very close to a mutually acceptable price.  Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, which would be $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can conclude the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,7,
