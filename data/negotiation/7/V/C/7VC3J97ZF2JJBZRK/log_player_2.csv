{""message"": ""Alice,  your offer of $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I understand that's a bit above your budget, but I'm confident the product's value is worth more to you than that. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I placed on the product and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my budget. While it's a good compromise, I can still try to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, $975,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This represents a further compromise on my end, and I believe we're getting very close to a mutually acceptable price.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, which would be $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can conclude the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers as there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  

To ensure I get the product within my budget, it's best to take John's offer of $800,000. It's the most secure way to secure the product while staying within my financial limitations."
