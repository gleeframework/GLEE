**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  While it's not your ideal price, it's still below your maximum of $150.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  You've already made a few counteroffers, and it's likely that Alice will be firm on her price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. 

It's a good deal considering your maximum budget, so accepting is the best option."
