# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly exceptional. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price."

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $887500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and my own expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob should continue to negotiate to get the best possible price.  There's still a possibility of getting a better deal, and Bob shouldn't settle for anything more than his target price of $800,000 unless it's very close to the end of the negotiations."
