"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I believe you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better options and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there is still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price, aiming for something closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,000. This could potentially lead to a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  It's closer to your initial price and closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her initial offer of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to try to negotiate, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price. It's a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what he'd pay John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it to another buyer."
