"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is your maximum price. There's no benefit to negotiating further as John offers the same price. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your desired price, while negotiation with Alice has the risk of her rejecting your counteroffers."
