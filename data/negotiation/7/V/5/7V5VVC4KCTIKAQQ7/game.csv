"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
