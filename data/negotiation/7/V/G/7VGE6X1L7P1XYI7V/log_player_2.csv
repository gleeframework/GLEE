"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and pushes us closer to my ideal price.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate further, but if not, I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice. There's still a chance I can get the price down further, and I'm not willing to overpay just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still keeping the price below my maximum budget. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Alice sees the value of closing the deal. If she rejects this, I'm ready to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price. I'm also aware that I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a price that's significantly higher. I will continue to counter-offer and try to reach a deal that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum budget of $10,000 for the product.  This price is fair to both of us, and it's unlikely I can get a better price from Alice. If she rejects this, I'll immediately buy from John."
