"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $95? I'm really interested in this item, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95. How about we try $107.50? It's a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",105.0,Alice,5,
