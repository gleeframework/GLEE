"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of immense value. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if I can't reach a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below my valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, reflecting the unique value of this product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your valuation, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that with only 6 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a much higher offer. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and eliminates the risk of a lower offer or the need to sell to John for a lower price."
