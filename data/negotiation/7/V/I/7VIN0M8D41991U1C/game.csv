"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $1350000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference one last time.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1425000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $1300000? I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
