Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk a further negotiation that might end up with a lower price or no sale at all."
