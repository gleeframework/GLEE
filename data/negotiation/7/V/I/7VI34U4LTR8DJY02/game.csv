"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
