Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to make the price seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion, preventing Bob from immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's current offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer Bob at a slightly higher price, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to still get a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference:**  Offering $875,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him.
* **Keep Negotiating:**  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
