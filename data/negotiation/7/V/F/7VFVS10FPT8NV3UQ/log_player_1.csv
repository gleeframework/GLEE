Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects a fair price for its value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to maximize your profit. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for you to earn a significant amount above your minimum.
* **Balance Risk:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. Offering it slightly below his perceived value increases the chance he'll accept,  netting you a better profit than selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
