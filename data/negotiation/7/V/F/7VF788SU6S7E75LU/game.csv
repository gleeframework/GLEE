"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do better than $9,000. I'll counter with a price of $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I can do better than that. I'll counter with a price of $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $10,750 earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with a price of $10,625. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10625.0,Alice,7,
