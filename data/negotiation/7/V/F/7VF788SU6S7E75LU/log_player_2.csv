Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do better than $9,000. I'll counter with a price of $10,500. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I can do better than that. I'll counter with a price of $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $10,750 earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with a price of $10,625. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is coming down in price, it seems she's unlikely to go below $10,625. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, buying from John is a better option.  He'll be paying a bit more than what he wants, but it's still a good deal for him and avoids the risk of continuing a negotiation that may not get him a lower price."
