"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm thinking $95 is a fair price, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While you value the product, $95 is close to your maximum.
* **Negotiation is worth it.**  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John is a backup.**  Having John as an option gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, given the value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your value.** $90 is only $10 more than what you're willing to pay, and it's still less than John's price.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile.**  You've already successfully negotiated down from $95, and pushing for a lower price might risk Alice walking away.
* **John is still an option.**  If Alice rejects your counteroffer again, you can always go to John."
