Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  Let's try to bridge that gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price that's acceptable for me. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
