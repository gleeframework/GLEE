"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the value of the product. 
* **First Round Strategy:** In the first round, it's important to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Exploring a Counteroffer:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $140 is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $150 and Bob's offer of $120.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still trying to get a price closer to my value while showing flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and focusing on the value of the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product!  I'm willing to go down to $135.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I know you won't regret it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, moving only $5 closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to encourage a deal. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Final Offer Suggestion:** I frame this offer as a possibility for both of us to reach a fair deal, subtly encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer much further. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

Given the limited time and the fact that I can secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John."
