,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Is that something you'd consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product!  I'm willing to go down to $135.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I know you won't regret it.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd consider?",125.0,Bob,6,
