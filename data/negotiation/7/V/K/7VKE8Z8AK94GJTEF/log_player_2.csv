Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's potential and my investment in it. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  I believe this strikes a more balanced approach, recognizing the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.
