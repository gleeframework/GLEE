Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Since the product is only worth $100 to Bob, offering it at $119 leaves room for negotiation while staying above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so I'm not pressured to go below that.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
