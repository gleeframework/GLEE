Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.  If you're not interested, I'll be happy to sell to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no guarantee you can get it lower, and it's not worth the risk of her selling to someone else."
