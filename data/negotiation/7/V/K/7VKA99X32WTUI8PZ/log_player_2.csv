It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, Alice's offer is a good starting point.  Let's see if we can get it lower!"

Let's start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within our budget.  This will give us some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we're both happy with."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. We've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting close to our maximum price with John. While we could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more. Accepting her offer is the best option to ensure we get the product and save a good amount of money."
