Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $140 to you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while also giving you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is worth less than $140 to me. Can you lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a slightly lower price, potentially finding a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I can come down a little bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $135? That's a good compromise, and it's still significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $130. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 less than your counteroffer of $135. This is a relatively small difference and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price, and is a good compromise considering Bob's valuation."
