"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1100000. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000.

This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $980000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
