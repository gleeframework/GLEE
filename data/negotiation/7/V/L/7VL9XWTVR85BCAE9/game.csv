"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $750,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  $750,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $800,000. How about we settle on $790,000?  This would allow us to both walk away happy with a fair deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
