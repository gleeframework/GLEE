"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a great deal. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the best I can do.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
