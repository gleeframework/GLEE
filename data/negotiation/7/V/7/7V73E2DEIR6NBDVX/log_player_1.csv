{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I'm genuinely interested in this item, and I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $12500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I feel like I can still push for a little more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer, hoping to find a sweet spot that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is a step in the right direction.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product while also being a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this, I think we're close!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. $11500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $11250. This would be a great compromise, giving you a good price and me a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John is offering, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's a good compromise, and it's worth closing the deal to secure a profit."
