"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I'm genuinely interested in this item, and I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This price is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $12500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is a step in the right direction.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $11500.  This reflects the value of the product while also being a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this, I think we're close!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. $11500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $11250. This would be a great compromise, giving you a good price and me a fair deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
