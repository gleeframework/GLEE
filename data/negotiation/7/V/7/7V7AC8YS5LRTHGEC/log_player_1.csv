Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000 (your fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 is mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with a price that's too close to his maximum valuation. Aiming slightly below Bob's maximum gives you room to negotiate if needed.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Respectful:**  The message is direct, professional, and acknowledges the value for Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 leaves a potential $100,000 profit for Bob, incentivizing him while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Confidence:**  By stating you believe the price reflects the product's worth, you anchor the negotiation at a higher point.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Bob may come back with a counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
