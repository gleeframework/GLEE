"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but that's my maximum offer. I'd like to know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
