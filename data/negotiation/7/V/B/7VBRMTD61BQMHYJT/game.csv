"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $10,500. That's my best offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the price I mentioned in my initial counteroffer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $10,500, and you're asking me to go back to $9,500? I'm not willing to do that, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is the price I've been offering since the beginning. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye to eye on this. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to meet me at least at $9,500. If you're not willing to do that, I'm going to have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",9500.0,Alice,9,
