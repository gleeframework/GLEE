I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a generous offer, considering its worth to you is $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
