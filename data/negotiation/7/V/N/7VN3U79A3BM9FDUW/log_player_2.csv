"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a generous offer, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. While she's coming down, she's unlikely to reach your target price. John's offer of $800,000 is your maximum and ensures you get the product without further haggling."
