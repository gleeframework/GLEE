Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  The goal is to get as close to that number as possible without scaring him off.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $800,000, but aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly."
