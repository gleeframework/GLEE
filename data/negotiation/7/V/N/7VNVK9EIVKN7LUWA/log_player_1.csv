Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John at $8,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
