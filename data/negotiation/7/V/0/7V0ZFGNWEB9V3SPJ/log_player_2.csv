"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. Since the product is worth $120 to you and only $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."

You can still get a better deal.  While $110 is closer to your ideal price, it's still worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get it down further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

Alice has come down to $105, which is a good deal for you. It's better than John's price, and you're still getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."
