"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product to Bob might make him more willing to pay closer to my asking price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a strategy of starting high and seeing how Bob reacts. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's more in line with my value for the product. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my initial asking price of $10,000, but also acknowledges Bob's lower budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,000.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a step towards Bob's offer but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. By offering a concrete number, I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit shy of my target. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer.  There's still potential for a deal that's more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer again keeps my negotiating leverage and allows me to potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to reject Bob's offers while aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $8,500 but less than my initial $10,000 offer. I'm also keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and the option to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise again by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference is a common negotiation tactic and can signal a willingness to find a solution.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering $8,750, I'm taking a small step towards Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping that this compromise will entice Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider whether I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and time is becoming a factor.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my negotiating leverage and allows me to try to get a higher price.

**Strategy:**

While time is running out, I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'll need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers.  I'll aim for a price that's higher than $8,200, but still lower than my initial asking price. If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll be more likely to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  While I can't go as low as $8,200, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $8,400? That's a fair compromise and it would allow us to close this deal. We're both getting closer to what we want, and this price feels like a win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference Again:** I'm using this tactic again, as it shows I'm flexible and willing to work towards a solution.
* **Emphasizing a Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a positive outcome for both of us, which can make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Addressing Time Pressure:** I'm subtly acknowledging the limited rounds by suggesting a closing of the deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to inch closer to Bob's desired price while still staying above my minimum. I'm hopeful that offering a compromise and highlighting the benefits of a deal will encourage Bob to accept. If not, I'll need to be prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, there's not much time for further negotiation.
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is a very small increase from his previous offer. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly better price in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and meets my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

While I'm hoping for a higher price, I'm not confident I'll get it with Bob in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John ensures that I get a good deal and don't risk losing out on a profitable sale."
