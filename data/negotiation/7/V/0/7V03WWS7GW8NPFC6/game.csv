"Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. I truly believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential value, I propose an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers at $987,500?  I'm confident this price is fair considering both of our perspectives.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I believe your current offer undervalues the significant benefits this product brings. It's not just about meeting in the middle, but recognizing its true worth. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the immense value you'll gain.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm sure this product is valuable.  However,  $1,010,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Let's split the difference between our last offers at $998,750. This would be a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this time.",998750.0,Bob,6,
