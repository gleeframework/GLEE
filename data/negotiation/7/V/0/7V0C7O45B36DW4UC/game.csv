"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product from John for $12000 if we can't agree.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the alternative offer from John. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you at $13200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",13200.0,Alice,5,
