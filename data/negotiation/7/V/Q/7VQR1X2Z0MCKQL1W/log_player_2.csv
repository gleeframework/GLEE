"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $140 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132? I'm sure we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  While it's closer than her previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer.  He has 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $132, but I'm still limited to $125.  Let's split the difference and go with $128.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that.  $128 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offers and has only 5 rounds left.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and Bob could end up wasting precious rounds.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the best possible price within his budget."
