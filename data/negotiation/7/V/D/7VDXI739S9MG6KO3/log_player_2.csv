"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob values the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob can likely get a better deal.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge.  
* **Buying from John is an option.**  While John is more expensive, it's important for Bob to know he has an alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within Bob's budget:** $85 is significantly less than Alice's initial offer and well within Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but not so low that it's immediately insulting. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:**  Bob can adjust his price based on Alice's reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high.**  Bob is aiming for a price closer to $85, and $95 is still outside that range. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob can likely get a price closer to his target with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  Bob is aware that John is selling the product for $120, so he can always choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a middle ground between his previous offer of $85 and Alice's counteroffer of $95. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:** $90 is a reasonable price for both parties. It's still below Bob's maximum price of $120 and above Alice's minimum price of $80.
* **Encouraging a deal:** The message emphasizes the potential for a successful agreement."
