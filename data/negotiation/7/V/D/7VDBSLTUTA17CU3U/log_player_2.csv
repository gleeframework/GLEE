"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than the product's worth to her, you know you can get it for a guaranteed $80 from John.  You want to save as much as possible."
