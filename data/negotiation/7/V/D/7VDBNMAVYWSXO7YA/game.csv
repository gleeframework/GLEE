"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price point to make it work.  Would you be willing to consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I'm looking to keep this purchase under $1,000,000.  Would you be open to a price of $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your desired budget. How about we settle on $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a big leap from what I'm willing to spend.  I need to see this closer to the $800,000 mark to make sense for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your position and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we land at $1,200,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
