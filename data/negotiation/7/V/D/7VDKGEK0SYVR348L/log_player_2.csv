# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,500, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking $11,000 is a better fit for both of us. What do you think?

Round 7

# Alice's message: I understand you've made a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to closing the deal today. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000.

Alice's offer is still a bit above my budget, and we're running out of rounds. While I would prefer to get the product for even less,  it's getting close to my limit.  John is offering a guaranteed deal for my target price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether."
