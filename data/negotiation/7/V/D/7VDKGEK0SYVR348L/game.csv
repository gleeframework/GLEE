"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $12,000 is a fair price for this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  If we can agree on that, I'd be happy to close the deal today.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,500, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking $11,000 is a better fit for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to closing the deal today. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, which is $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,7,
