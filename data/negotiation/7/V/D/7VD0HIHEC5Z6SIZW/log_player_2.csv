Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.
