"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
