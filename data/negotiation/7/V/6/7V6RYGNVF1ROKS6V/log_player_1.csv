Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it above that creates a potential profit margin.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, giving her leverage.

**The Strategy:**

This offer aims to find a middle ground. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but low enough that he might consider it a good deal compared to finding a similar product elsewhere. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything because she can sell to John at her desired price."
