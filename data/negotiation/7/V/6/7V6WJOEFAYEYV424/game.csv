While the product is certainly valuable,  I'm looking to make a more significant investment and need to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential return on investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
