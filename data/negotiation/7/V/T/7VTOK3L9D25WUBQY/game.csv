"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $760,000?  That's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $790,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
