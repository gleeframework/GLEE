Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to get close to my ideal price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'd rather sell than let the product go, I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. It's a compromise, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while ensuring I get at least a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a little more, Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum value. However,  I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from him, and it's getting risky.  John's offer is a guaranteed $100, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
