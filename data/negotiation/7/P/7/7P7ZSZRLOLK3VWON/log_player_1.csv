"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd love! I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also expressing a willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($150).  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering with $140, which is still above my minimum price of $150. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, and John is a guaranteed buyer at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, but this time I'm stating that it's my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Even though Bob has come up slightly, he's still far below my minimum.  John is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale while trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob."
