"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 at this time.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go up to $160, which is the highest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
