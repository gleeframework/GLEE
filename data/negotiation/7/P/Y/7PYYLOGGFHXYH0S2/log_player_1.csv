**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll come up enough in future rounds to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which meets our minimum. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
