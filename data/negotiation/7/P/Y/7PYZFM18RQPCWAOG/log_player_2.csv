"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to meet Alice halfway. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  The $1,200,000 offer is a good starting point, and I'll adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my target of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering I have 7 rounds remaining, it's a risk to keep negotiating. If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, she might push the price even higher. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me time and potential headaches."
