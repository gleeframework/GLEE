"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My starting price is $120, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer that's still within my budget and gives me some room to negotiate further. It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a good deal considering the product is worth $80 to her.  There's a good chance I could negotiate further, but there's also a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I might have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids any further risk."
