Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant ROI for you.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While $1,500,000 (your minimum) might be too aggressive, $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" without being overly specific. This allows Bob to justify the price in his mind.
* **""Fair reflection"":** This phrase subtly implies that the price is non-negotiable but open to discussion.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, ensuring you won't settle for less.

This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving a small margin for negotiation if Bob counters."
