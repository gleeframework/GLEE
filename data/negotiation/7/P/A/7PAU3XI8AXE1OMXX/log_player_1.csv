Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly justifies the higher price without explicitly revealing her minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice implies Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act now. This can encourage a quicker decision.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone remains polite and invites Bob's feedback, encouraging a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one.

**Important Note:**  Alice needs to be prepared to potentially negotiate the price down if Bob counters.  However, she always has the safety net of John's offer at $12,000."
