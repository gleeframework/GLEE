Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you can expect."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, suggesting he might be willing to pay a premium for it.
* **Negotiation Room:** The initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob finds it too high. You can always lower the price slightly during the negotiation process while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 

By starting high, you maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase a product he clearly values."
