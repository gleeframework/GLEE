"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
