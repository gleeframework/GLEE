"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower.  Accepting the offer means Bob saves $2,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to Alice.  It's important to balance the potential for further savings with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
