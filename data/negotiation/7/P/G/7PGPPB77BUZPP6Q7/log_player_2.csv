# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer of $900,000 to you, which is a 12.5% discount from its true value. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?
