"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum price of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. I'll reject the offer and attempt to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately higher than my budget allows.  I understand the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm not comfortable accepting $16,000 yet, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13500. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $14500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and attempt to counter with a lower price once again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. Let's try $15000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $15,000 is still too high for me. While I've been trying to negotiate with Alice, I've already used a significant amount of my bargaining power and gone beyond my initial budget. With only a few rounds left, the chances of getting Alice to go lower are slim.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing: buying from John for $12,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further potential negotiations that might not be successful."
