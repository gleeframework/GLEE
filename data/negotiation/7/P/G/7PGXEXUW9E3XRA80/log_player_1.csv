"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us.  We have room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product has the potential to generate substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still a gap to bridge before reaching John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer. How about we settle on $1,650,000? That reflects a significant movement from my initial ask while still acknowledging the product's inherent value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're very close to John's offer now. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 8
Bob's offer:
