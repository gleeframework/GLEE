Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than $100, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is above your minimum of $120, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your offer down if needed, giving Bob some leverage and potentially leading to a quicker deal.

This strategy aims to quickly establish a starting point while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a price closer to my target.  I have the option of selling to John for $120, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $115 to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using encouraging language to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere and keep Bob motivated. 

By finding a middle ground, I hope to reach an agreement quickly and avoid needing to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $108?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm sticking with $110, which is my final compromise. This offer demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still protecting my minimum profit.
* **Positive and persuasive:** My message remains positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Clear next steps:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting the ball back in Bob's court.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $120, as I'm confident that I won't get a better price from Bob."
