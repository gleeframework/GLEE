# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to consider other options or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
