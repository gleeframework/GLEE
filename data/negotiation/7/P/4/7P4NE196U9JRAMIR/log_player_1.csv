Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher price, $175 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get more from Bob in further negotiations.  I'd rather close the deal than risk getting nothing if I continue negotiating."
