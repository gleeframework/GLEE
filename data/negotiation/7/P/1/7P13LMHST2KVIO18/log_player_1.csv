{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, giving you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone, potentially building rapport and increasing Bob's willingness to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. While $120 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $175. That's still a fair price for this valuable product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $150 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is exactly what I can get from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as there's no chance of getting a higher price from Bob.  It's time to sell to John."
