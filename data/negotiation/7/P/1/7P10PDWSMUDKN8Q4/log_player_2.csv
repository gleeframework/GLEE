"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  You can save $500 by getting it for $9,000 or less, and there are still 9 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still $250 above your ideal price.  There are 7 rounds left, and you can likely squeeze out another $100 or $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to get a good price Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,125.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9125}
