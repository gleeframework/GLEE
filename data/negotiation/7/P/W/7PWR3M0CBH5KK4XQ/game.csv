"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and pay $12000 if that's the lowest you can go.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
