"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob,  he can reject Alice's offer of $11,500. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than he'd ideally like to pay. He should continue negotiating, keeping in mind that he can always buy from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate your flexibility. While I understand your position, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $11,250? This price is fair to both of us, and I believe the value of this product will far exceed the cost for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, the price is getting closer to Bob's maximum. While $11,250 is only $250 more than his target, it is still more than he wants to pay. He is better off buying from John for $10,000."
