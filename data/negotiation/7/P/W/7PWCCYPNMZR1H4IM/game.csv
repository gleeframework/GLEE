"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your flexibility. While I understand your position, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $11,250? This price is fair to both of us, and I believe the value of this product will far exceed the cost for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
