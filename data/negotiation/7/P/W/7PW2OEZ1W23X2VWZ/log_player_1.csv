Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate and gives you a strong starting position. 
* **Expressing Confidence:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, creating a sense of urgency and potential for Bob to want to secure the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that you are open to negotiation, but also establishes a strong initial price point. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy. If he counteroffers:

* **Analyze the counteroffer:**  How far is it from your price? Is it reasonable?
* **Consider your backup option:**  Remember you can always sell to John for $800,000.
* **Decide whether to accept or counteroffer:** If the offer is close to your target or you feel Bob is serious, accept. Otherwise, make a counteroffer, gradually lowering your price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your floor price:**  $750,000 is well below the $800,000 you're willing to accept from John. 
* **There's room to negotiate:** You can likely get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer, especially since you've already established a higher starting point.

**Next Steps:**

You'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for a price closer to your initial offer or John's offer. Consider factors like:

* How badly Bob wants the product (based on his counteroffer).
* Your comfort level with negotiating further.

Remember, you can always back out and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point,  I'm confident this product is worth more, considering its unique features and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial price, signaling flexibility. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique features and potential, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the potential for both parties to gain from the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's response:**  Will he accept the counteroffer, counter with a new offer, or walk away?
* **Evaluate the situation:**  If Bob counters again, analyze the new offer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John.
* **Stay strategic:**  Remember, you have the option to sell to John at $800,000 if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow the deal to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your floor price:** $825,000 is only $25,000 above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive:** Continuing to negotiate may risk losing Bob entirely and leaving you with John's offer, which is only slightly lower.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that either Bob will walk away or you'll lose interest and sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move at this point. You've secured a price close to your minimum, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
