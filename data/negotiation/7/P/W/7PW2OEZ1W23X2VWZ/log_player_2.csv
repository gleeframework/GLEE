"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a good starting point.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is a good starting point,  I'm confident this product is worth more, considering its unique features and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.

Alice has come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
