"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Confidence and Urgency:** My message expresses confidence in the deal's value and emphasizes the need for a swift closure. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's initial response and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I still have 9 rounds to work with.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I still have a good chance of getting closer to my target through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1,400,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but also highlight the product's value, justifying a higher price.
* **Moving Closer:**  My counteroffer moves significantly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters Again:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and his willingness to move towards my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,300,000? This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, which is enough time to potentially reach a better agreement.
* **John's offer is still on the table:**  While John's offer is secure, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

I believe it's worth continuing negotiations to try and push Bob closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again â€“ let's try $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fair Value:** I reiterate my willingness to compromise, emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my counteroffer.
* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  By moving my price down to $1,350,000, I'm demonstrating a clear intention to reach an agreement.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and sets the stage for potentially closing the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely I can push him much higher.
* **Time is Running Out:**  Time is becoming a factor. I need to make a decision to avoid losing out on John's guaranteed offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While John's offer is lower than my initial goal, it's still a secure and profitable deal. Selling to John guarantees a good outcome and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiations with Bob. 

Given the limited time and the potential for a stalemate, it's best to accept John's offer and move forward with the sale."
