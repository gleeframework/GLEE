Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000 (from John)
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000
* **My Strategy:** I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, maximizing my profit.

**Potential Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I get $1,000,000, which is a good profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** I sell to John for $800,000, which is my minimum."
