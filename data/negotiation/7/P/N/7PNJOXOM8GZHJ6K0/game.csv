"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
