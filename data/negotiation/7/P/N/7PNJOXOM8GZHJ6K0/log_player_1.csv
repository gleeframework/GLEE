{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for something of this quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, but still within the range that might be attractive to Bob. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and counter again.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several counteroffers.  At this point, it's clear we're not going to agree on a price. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150."
