,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I would get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit and still ensure you get a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still below my minimum price.  Let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not comfortable going any higher than that. Can you reconsider?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting closer to walking away, but I'm also not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. This product is worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is still fair.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $1,000,000, which is $990,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to reconsider our deal and explore other options.",990000.0,Bob,8,
