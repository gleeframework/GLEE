"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's worth more than that to me, but I know you'll get good value out of it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is within your budget of $100.
* **John's price is $100.** This is higher than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes more financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $10."
