Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's wrap this up â€“ I'm willing to come down slightly to $795,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.

``` 

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $795,000, saving $205,000 from your initial limit and $5,000 from John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice has signaled that this is her best price. Pushing further might risk the deal.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing the negotiation might not yield significantly better results and you risk running out of rounds. 

While you might be able to haggle a bit more, the potential savings are getting smaller and the risk of losing the deal increases."
