"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  I think it's a fair price, but let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is only worth $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be open to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer of $105 is closer to Bob's value, it's still slightly higher. Bob can try to negotiate further to reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $100? That's the absolute most I'm willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
