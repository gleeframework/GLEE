Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $8,000, as that's my floor.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so I have room to negotiate. 
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point. It's a significant price difference from my minimum, allowing for some bargaining, but also leaving me with a healthy profit. 

This strategy aims to get a good deal quickly, but leaves room for counteroffers if Bob is keen on a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **John's offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, I believe I can get more from Bob.
* **Counter-offer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation open with Bob, as he is willing to pay more than John and there's potential to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum, but he's shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **My Target:** I want to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000.
* **Counter-offer:**  By offering $11,000, I'm showing flexibility while still holding out for a price that's significantly better than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to bridge the gap and find a price acceptable to both of us, hopefully securing a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob has increased his offer to $10,500. This is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **John's Offer:** While I can secure a guaranteed $8,000 from John, Bob's offer is significantly higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I might be forced to sell to John. However, the potential reward of $10,500 outweighs the risk.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by accepting Bob's offer, as it offers a significantly better deal compared to selling to John."
