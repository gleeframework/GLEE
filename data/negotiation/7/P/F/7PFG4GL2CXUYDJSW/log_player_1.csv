Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, given its market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,350,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise given the market value.  This is my final offer.
