"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, given its market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,350,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise given the market value.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
