"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating. You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,200,000) and Alice's offer ($900,000) so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully sparks a negotiation that leads to a mutually acceptable price. While $700,000 is a considerable discount, it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation, keeping in mind the buffer I have with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to $750,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price that is significantly lower than her previous offer.  I'm confident that I can reach a deal with Alice within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but it's getting closer.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can close the deal with Alice at a price below $825,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, this time to $800,000. This is getting very close to Alice's potential ""walk-away"" price, but I believe she might be willing to accept it. The deal is within my budget, and it's significantly better than buying from John. It's a good compromise that allows me to save a considerable amount while getting the product I want."
