Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John.  Therefore, she needs to aim for a price higher than that to make offering it to Bob worthwhile.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than John's offer.
* **Appeal to Value, Not Just Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, not just the price tag. This can make the offer more appealing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start with a slightly higher price to provide more wiggle room.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more willing to accept a lower offer from Bob to avoid delays."
