# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially get a better price from Alice."
