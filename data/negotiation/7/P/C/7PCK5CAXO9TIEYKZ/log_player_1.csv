"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to introduce you to this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for discussions"" signals my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, I gain significant profit.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's reaction will give me valuable insight into his willingness to spend and how much he values the product.
3. **Control the Negotiation:**  Starting high allows me to steer the negotiation from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this product. While I acknowledge its potential, the price point you've presented is significantly higher than my current budget. I'd be interested in exploring this further if you're open to a figure closer to my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. While I want to maximize profit, I'm prepared to negotiate. Rejecting this low offer allows me to counter and work towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. This reflects the true value and potential it holds. Would you be willing to consider a figure closer to that mark?"",
""product_price"": 1500000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I've chosen to be completely transparent with Bob by revealing my minimum acceptable price. This builds trust and demonstrates my seriousness about closing a deal.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential to justify my minimum price, but without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I've presented my minimum, I'm still phrasing it as a question (""Would you be willing..."") to encourage further discussion and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Set a Clear Boundary:**  Bob is now aware of the lowest I'm willing to go, preventing further lowball offers.
2. **Encourage a Realistic Counter:**  By presenting my minimum with room for negotiation, I hope to receive a counteroffer closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
3. **Maintain Deal Momentum:**  I'm still invested in negotiating with Bob, as there's a possibility to secure a price higher than my fallback option of $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the product's value to you. I'm still very interested but at a lower price point. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant difference of $500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal. I'm strategically using my rejection to signal that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate to accept the first offer above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial figure. How about we meet halfway between your offer and my minimum?  It demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while still reflecting the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This shows flexibility on my part while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value without being repetitive by emphasizing that this price reflects its worth.
* **Urgency and Deal Focus:** By stating ""my commitment to getting this deal done,"" I'm injecting a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm motivated to close, encouraging Bob to seriously consider this offer. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Find a Middle Ground:**  The compromise aims to quickly move the negotiation towards a close.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  While compromising, the offer is still significantly above Bob's initial offers, reinforcing the product's value.
3. **Signal Deal-Closing Intent:**  The messaging emphasizes my desire to finalize the deal, potentially leading Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to meet halfway is encouraging. To bridge the remaining gap, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment from my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, the remaining difference is relatively small. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit of $100,000 over my fallback option with John and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds. 

It's important to recognize when pushing for a slightly better deal might jeopardize a favorable offer that's already on the table."
