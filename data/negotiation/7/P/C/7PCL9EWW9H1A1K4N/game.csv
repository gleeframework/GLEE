"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
