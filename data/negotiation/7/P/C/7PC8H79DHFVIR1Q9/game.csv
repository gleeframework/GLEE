"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $2,100,000?  I think this price point reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
