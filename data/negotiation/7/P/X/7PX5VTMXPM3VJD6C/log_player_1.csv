Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a negotiation.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still earning a significant profit above your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate, as he values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
