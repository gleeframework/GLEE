"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you get the product for $1,000,000, which is less than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000).
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** and buying from John is a worse outcome financially."
