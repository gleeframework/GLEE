"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is the best I can do for now.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer to your target.  How about $1,200,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalise the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need a bit more. Let's try $1,220,000. This is my final offer for now.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
