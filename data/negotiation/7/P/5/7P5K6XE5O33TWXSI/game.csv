"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price of $110.  Would you be willing to meet me at $105?  This would be a fair compromise, I believe.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your compromise. While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $100 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up to $102.50? This would be a fair middle ground that I believe we can both agree on.",102.5,Alice,7,
