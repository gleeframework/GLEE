"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $110 to make this worthwhile for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired value. I'm also acknowledging his offer and reiterating my desire to make the deal work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price of $110.  Would you be willing to meet me at $105?  This would be a fair compromise, I believe."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of slowly bridging the gap between our desired prices. Offering $105 feels like a reasonable compromise that shows I'm open to negotiation but not willing to drastically lower my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $105. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise. While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $100 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up to $102.50? This would be a fair middle ground that I believe we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate in small increments, demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching a deal but also unwilling to concede too much. I'm also highlighting the potential for a ""fair middle ground"" to emphasize mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $102.50. How about $99? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that meets my minimum requirement of $150. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $150 guarantees I don't lose money and ensures a quick, stress-free sale."
