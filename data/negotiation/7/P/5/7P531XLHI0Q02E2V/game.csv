"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,000,000? This price is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and gets us closer to a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
