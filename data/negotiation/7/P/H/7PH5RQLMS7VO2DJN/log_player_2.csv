"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way over his budget. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still do better. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's a better deal for Bob."
