"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider a price of $130?,130.0,Bob,4,
