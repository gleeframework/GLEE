"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,800. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about $9,000?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price that balances both our interests.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. I'm ready to go to $9,200.  This is my final offer, and it reflects my budget.  Let's close the deal.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,200 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can offer it to you for $9,600. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9600.0,Alice,7,
