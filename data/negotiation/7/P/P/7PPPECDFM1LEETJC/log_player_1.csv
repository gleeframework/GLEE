""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down later.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for your price (even if it's just perceived value) can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down or go to John. 
* **Protecting Your Minimum:**  You are guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you don't lose anything by aiming higher with Bob."
