Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob's valuation but less than my minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledges that I need to make a concession to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is too low and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John, so I'll sell the product to him."
