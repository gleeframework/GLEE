"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $10500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I think $11500 is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. However, I want to make one last check to see if I can get a better offer from John. I'll hold off on accepting your offer for now. If I don't hear from John, I'll come back to you.",11500.0,Alice,11,
