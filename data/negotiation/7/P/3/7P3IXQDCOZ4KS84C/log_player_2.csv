"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate, but also establishes a clear starting point that's within my budget. Hopefully, this will spark a conversation and we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $14,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point of $15,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $15,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to keep the price as close to my budget as possible.  This is a reasonable compromise that should encourage Alice to accept."
