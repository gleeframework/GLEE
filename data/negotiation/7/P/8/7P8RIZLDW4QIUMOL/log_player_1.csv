"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's interest shows there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that pushes the price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my minimum profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $8,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can push Bob a bit higher. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation going and potentially achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,400, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** My counteroffer shows I'm willing to budge but still aim for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Positive and Motivating:** The message is enthusiastic and encourages Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Finality:**  By using phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" and ""make this happen,"" I subtly pressure Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $8,300, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,300 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John increases with each rejection. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting Bob's offer is the most strategically sound choice at this point, considering my minimum price and the limited time remaining."
