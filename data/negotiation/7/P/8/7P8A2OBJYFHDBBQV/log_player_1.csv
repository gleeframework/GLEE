"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also considering the fact that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I'm not going to accept anything lower.  This will give me a good gauge of Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $17,000 is better than my minimum of $15,000,  I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $18,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can close the deal.  We've only had 4 rounds, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500. This is another compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal.  We're getting closer, and I want to close the deal before we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer, I'm not willing to settle for a price this low just yet.  We have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $16,500. We're getting close to Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about closing a deal.  We only have a few rounds left, so I want to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I am only $500 above my minimum, but I am concerned about running out of time.  Bob has shown a clear pattern of dropping his offer by $500 each time.  Since I have only 2 rounds left, if I reject this offer, I risk Bob dropping his offer to $15,500, and I will have to either accept that or sell to John for $15,000. Therefore, I am going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000."
