"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $500 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point, as it shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also acknowledges that Alice needs to make a profit. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from the previous round, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob is trying to get the best possible price, and this offer is not yet within his budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is willing to compromise, but still wants a better price than Alice's last offer.  The offer is still below Alice's minimum, leaving room for negotiation while also being closer to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it is closer to his target price, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, showing his willingness to compromise. This offer is still lower than Alice's last offer but is getting closer to a potential deal. Bob is betting that Alice will be more likely to accept a price closer to her minimum, especially as they are nearing the halfway point in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price. Even though they are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer one more time, potentially pushing Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's last offer.  This is a significant increase from his previous counteroffer and is likely to be seen as a serious attempt to reach an agreement.  Bob is hoping that with only a few rounds left, Alice will be more willing to compromise and accept an offer closer to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is only $200 away from Bob's maximum price, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. This is his last chance to make a counteroffer before having to choose between buying from Alice or John. Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. He's pushing for a price that's still slightly below Alice's last offer but is significantly closer to his desired price.  This is a high-risk move, as Alice could reject the offer and Bob would have to buy from John for a higher price. However, Bob is hoping that Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accept his offer. Since there is no further negotiation possible if Alice rejects this offer, there is little room for Bob to improve his price."
