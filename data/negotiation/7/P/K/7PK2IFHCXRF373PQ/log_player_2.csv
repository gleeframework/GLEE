"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I believe this offer presents a great value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially save even more by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $14,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. This price is still fair for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on your offer, I am happy to consider a middle ground. How about we agree on $14,000 for the product? This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000 which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. It's a good compromise and still saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
