"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer, giving me a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 8 more rounds to reach a better deal or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating or sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  It's also only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable value, making it a potentially attractive deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that I can get a better deal from Bob. John's offer is my minimum acceptable value, and it guarantees a sale without further negotiation."
