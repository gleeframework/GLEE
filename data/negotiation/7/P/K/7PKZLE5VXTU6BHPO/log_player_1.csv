Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:** $12,000 is still well below the $15,000 the product is worth to Bob, making it a good deal for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Offering $12,000 allows for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while also potentially reaching a deal with Bob."
