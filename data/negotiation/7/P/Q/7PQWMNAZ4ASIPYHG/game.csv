,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to finalize a deal at $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $15,500, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm ready to finalize a deal at $14,500. This is a good price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $14,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,500 and my previous offer of $15,500, which would be $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,7,
