"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than $100 to you, given its quality and benefits. Let's discuss how we can reach a fair price that reflects its true value.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $110. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my original asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budget.",110.0,Alice,3,
