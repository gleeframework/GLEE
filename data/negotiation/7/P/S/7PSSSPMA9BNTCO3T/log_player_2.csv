"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than $100 to you, given its quality and benefits. Let's discuss how we can reach a fair price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since the product is worth $150 to you, you have room to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer will allow you to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a decent price considering you're willing to pay up to $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $110. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my original asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise. While it's still higher than your initial counteroffer, it's lower than her original price and closer to your desired range. It's worth accepting the offer rather than risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a lost deal."
