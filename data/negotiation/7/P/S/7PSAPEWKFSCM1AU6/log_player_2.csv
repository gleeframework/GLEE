**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round out of 10, and Alice is clearly holding firm around the $7,200 - $7,500 range. While we could try one more counteroffer, we risk Alice digging in her heels and us missing out on any discount. Accepting $7,275 secures a decent discount of $2,725 and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
