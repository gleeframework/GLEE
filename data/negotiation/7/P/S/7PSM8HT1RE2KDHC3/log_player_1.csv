Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you (Alice), the message hints at its worth by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing. This implies it's desirable and you have other options.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), inviting a counter-offer from Bob and signaling a willingness to negotiate.

By offering the product at $15,000, you, as Alice, aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly above your minimum of $12,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of settling on a price higher than what John offers."
