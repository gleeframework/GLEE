"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $700,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This price is still reasonable while ensuring we both benefit from this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I respect your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we settle at $780,000? It's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",780000.0,Alice,5,
