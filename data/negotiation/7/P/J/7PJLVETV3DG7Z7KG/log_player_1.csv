"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This leaves room for negotiation, but is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but still allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $100. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and shows I'm willing to be flexible.  However, it's still a good price for me and leaves room for a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and get the deal done."
