"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is good, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to say that $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my target price of $8,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can negotiate much further. It's also a good price compared to John's offer of $12,000.  I'll accept the offer."
