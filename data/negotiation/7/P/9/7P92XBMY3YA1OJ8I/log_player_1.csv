Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a significant amount, justifying the high starting price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating. 
* **Alternative Option:** While you haven't explicitly mentioned John, the phrase ""before I list it publicly"" implies there are other avenues for selling the product, creating a subtle sense of urgency for Bob. 

This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
