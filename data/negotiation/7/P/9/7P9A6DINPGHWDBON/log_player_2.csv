It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very clearly trying to squeeze every possible dollar out of you.  While you *might* be able to get the price down a little more, it's unlikely it will be a significant difference, and you risk her getting frustrated and ending the negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price of $150, which is better than continuing with an uncertain outcome."
