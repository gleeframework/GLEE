Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob's business, increasing its perceived worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an invitation for Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a new counteroffer, potentially lowering the price slightly.
* If I feel he won't meet my minimum, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Although Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:**  Selling to John would secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 but potentially leave money on the table if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely starting with a price closer to $800,000 or $850,000, trying to find a middle ground. 
* **Assess Bob's Response:** I will carefully evaluate Bob's response to my counteroffer to determine if further negotiation is worthwhile or if I should move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price point that I believe reflects the value of this product for your business. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm justifying this counteroffer by highlighting the value of the product and the significant reduction from my initial offer. 
* **Seeking common ground:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to find a compromise that benefits both of us. This approach aims to keep the negotiation open and avoid an immediate rejection.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm still not willing to go below $850,000, ensuring I don't get locked into an unfavorable deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** I'll closely examine Bob's response to see if he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Prepare for potential negotiation:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll be prepared to make a new offer or potentially sell to John, depending on the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Potential loss:** While I would prefer to sell for more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting his offer and potentially going back and forth for several more rounds. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time and effort, considering I can secure a guaranteed $800,000 now.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
