"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm willing to sell it for less than that. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
