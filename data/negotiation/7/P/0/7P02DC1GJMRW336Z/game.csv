"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards my budget, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Could we settle at $680,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting the sense we're reaching our limits here. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,7,
