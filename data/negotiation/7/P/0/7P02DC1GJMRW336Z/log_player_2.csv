Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

Alice is unwilling to budge from $725,000. While closer to my goal, it's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Buying from John at $1,000,000, while not ideal, ensures I obtain the product and avoids the risk of Alice completely withdrawing her offer."
