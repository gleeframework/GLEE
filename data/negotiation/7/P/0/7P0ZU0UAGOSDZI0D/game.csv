"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $60 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you do $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $60 is too low, but $110 is still a bit much for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about $95? That's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
