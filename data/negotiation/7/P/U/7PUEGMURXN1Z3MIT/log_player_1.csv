"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $175. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a price above my minimum.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my preferred price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'll reject Bob's offer again and continue to negotiate. I'm hoping we can reach a price that's more fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can close the deal in the next couple of rounds. It's a tough choice, as selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my price to $150. This is my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell to John, but I'm holding out hope that we can reach a deal."
