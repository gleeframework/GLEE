"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $9500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8750. I'll meet you halfway between $8750 and $9000, which is $8875. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",8875.0,Alice,5,
