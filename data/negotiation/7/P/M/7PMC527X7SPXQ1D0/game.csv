"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product looks great, $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $80 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  To be totally honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to make the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth more to me than that, and I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
