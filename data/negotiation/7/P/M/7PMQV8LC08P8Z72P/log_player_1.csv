{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20,000.  It's a real steal, considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, giving you room to negotiate.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, and I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I have a strong fallback option with John, so I can afford to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

I've countered with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. My message acknowledges his offer and shows flexibility, while still emphasizing the value of the product.  Let's see if this counteroffer gets us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it at this point. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise. My fallback option with John gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $15,500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident it will be a great value for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I've countered with $15,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold. The message emphasizes the value proposition and leaves the ball in Bob's court.  Let's see if this final counteroffer seals the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to further negotiate.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm confident that John will happily pay my minimum price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
