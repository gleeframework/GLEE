"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $15500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident it will be a great value for you.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
