"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
