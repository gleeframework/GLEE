"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers incredible value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $14,500.  I truly believe this product will be valuable to me, and this price makes it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,
