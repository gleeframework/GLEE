"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $130. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $125. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer the product to you for $135. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,5,
