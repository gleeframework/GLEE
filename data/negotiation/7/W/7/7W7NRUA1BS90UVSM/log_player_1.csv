"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and John is a guaranteed $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a better price.  Plus, John is still a safe backup option at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's closer to your offer, but still gives me some room to breathe. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'd like to offer $9,100.  It's just a small difference, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $150 away from my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not sure if we'll be able to get much closer to my ideal price, and it's a risk to reject this offer and potentially lose the deal altogether.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm better off taking this offer. If I'm not happy with it, I can still sell to John for $12,000, but I'd rather have some profit now than the possibility of nothing."
