"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my understanding of the product's potential necessitates a higher figure.

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant step towards your desired price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
