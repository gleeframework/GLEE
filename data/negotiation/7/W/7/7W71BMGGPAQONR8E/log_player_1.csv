Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, suggesting a reason for the high price without revealing my own valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message signals my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process.

By starting high and showing flexibility, I aim to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, so accepting anything less wouldn't be in my best interest.  

I'll counteroffer in hopes of bridging the gap, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my understanding of the product's potential necessitates a higher figure.  I could consider $1,150,000.  This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to compromise.
* **Holding Firm:**  The new price is still substantially above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. This reinforces the product's value and my position.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial"" deal, encouraging Bob to move closer to my price range.

By making a significant concession but holding firm on a price point above my minimum, I'm aiming to steer the negotiation in a favorable direction while remaining prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant step towards your desired price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's still below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. While he might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely he'll reach my desired price point. 

At this stage, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. It makes the most business sense to secure the guaranteed profit now."
