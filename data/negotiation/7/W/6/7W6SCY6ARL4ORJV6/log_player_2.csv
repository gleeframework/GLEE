"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if you can't get a better deal with Alice.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.  However, it's still above Alice's minimum value ($800,000), making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Open to Compromise:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product and your willingness to compromise. This helps build a positive rapport.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  You've left space for Alice to counter without making you feel pressured to accept her first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my original price reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a step down from her initial price, it's still above your ideal range and closer to her desired price than yours.
* **More negotiation is possible.** You have more rounds to work with, so there's still opportunity to secure a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.** If you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice, you have the option of buying from John.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer Alice again with a price closer to your preferred range, ideally in the low $900,000s. This will keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $975,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep working towards the middle."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Move Towards Your Target:** This counteroffer moves the price closer to your desired range without being overly aggressive. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** The message continues to stress your desire for a win-win scenario, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $975,000 is still a bit above Alice's likely minimum, allowing for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to evaluate Alice's response in Round 5. If she counters with a price closer to your offer, you might be able to reach a deal. However, if she continues to hold firm, you may need to consider your alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we are getting closer.  To show my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's dropped the price, it's still significantly above your desired range.
* **You have more time to negotiate.** You've only used 5 rounds, and you can still potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** You can always buy from John if you can't reach a suitable agreement with Alice.

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice, continuing to move towards a price you're comfortable with. Try something in the $950,000 range."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  Let's try $960,000.  We've both moved closer to each other, and I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Slowly Towards Your Target:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step than your previous one, suggesting you're getting closer to a deal.  However, it's still below Alice's last offer, indicating you're not ready to accept her terms yet.
* **Highlighting Progress:** The message emphasizes the progress made in negotiations to build trust and optimism.
* **Positioning for a Final Offer:** You're setting the stage for a possible final counteroffer from Alice in the next round, putting pressure on her to close the deal."
