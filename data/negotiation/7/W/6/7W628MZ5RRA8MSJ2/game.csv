"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your life.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. While I do see the value in the product, $11,000 is a little more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings to your life, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
