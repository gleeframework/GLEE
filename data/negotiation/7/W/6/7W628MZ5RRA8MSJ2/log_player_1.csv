Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. While I do see the value in the product, $11,000 is a little more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
