"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
