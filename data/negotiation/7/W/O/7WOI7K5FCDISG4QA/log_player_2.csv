"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate further and potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm happy to pay $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This gives her room to negotiate while still leaving me some space to potentially lower the price further.  I've also included a message that highlights the value of the deal for both of us, hoping to build a rapport and encourage her to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you seeing the value in the product.  While $9,500 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something a bit closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my desired price point. While it's closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. By focusing on the benefits of a compromise, I aim to encourage her to accept the deal."
