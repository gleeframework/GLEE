Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation without risking a quick rejection.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the value of the deal for both parties, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and avoiding an immediate stalemate. By starting with a reasonable offer, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open the door for a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'm going to counter Bob's offer, aiming to meet in the middle. By showing I'm willing to negotiate, I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Considering John:** It's important to keep John's offer in mind. Selling to John would be a sure thing, but I don't want to miss out on the chance to potentially get a slightly better price from Bob if I can find a common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$875,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise,  meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It signals flexibility while still maintaining a higher price point.
* **Message:** I reiterate my understanding of Bob's perspective and emphasize the significant reduction I'm making. This creates a sense of urgency and willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices. It's a calculated risk, but I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept this offer.
* **Maintaining Control:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in completely. By sticking to a price above $850,000, I ensure I'm still getting a good deal. 
* **Preparing for Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell to John."
