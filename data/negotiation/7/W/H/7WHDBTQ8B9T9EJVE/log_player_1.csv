Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
