"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling it to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it, considering my own valuation. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $825,000 is getting closer to what I can accept.  However, I'm still hoping to reach a price that's more in line with my initial goal.  I'm willing to offer $810,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",810000.0,Bob,6,
