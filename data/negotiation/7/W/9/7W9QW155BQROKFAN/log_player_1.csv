{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to make at least $800,000, which is your minimum.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** It's a significant discount from the product's value to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create the opportunity for a successful negotiation and potentially earn more than the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered, and you know the product is worth more to him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fantastic price for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant price for me, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and a better financial outcome than selling to John."
