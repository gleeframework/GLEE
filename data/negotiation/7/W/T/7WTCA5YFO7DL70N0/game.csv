"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $9000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000.
