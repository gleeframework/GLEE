# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and engaging in a productive discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value,  $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
