Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
