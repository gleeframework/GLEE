"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and engaging in a productive discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value,  $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
