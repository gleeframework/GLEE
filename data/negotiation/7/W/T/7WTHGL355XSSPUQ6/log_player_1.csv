Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I know you'll love. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Bob's higher valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly more than John's $100 offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential haggling while staying well above your minimum.
* **Secure a good profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by leveraging Bob's higher valuation while keeping your fallback option (selling to John) secure."
