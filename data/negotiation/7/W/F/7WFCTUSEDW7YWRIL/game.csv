"I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1150000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm now offering it to you for $1125000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
