"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm starting the price at $125, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is above your minimum of $100, ensuring you'll make a profit even if Bob accepts right away. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than the $150 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It invites negotiation:** The message explicitly states that you're open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is your minimum, you have 10 rounds and have already demonstrated that you are willing to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to pay $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to your desired price, and you have only 6 rounds remaining. Accepting his offer at $105 is a good compromise, ensuring you earn more than John's offer and avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price in the remaining rounds."
