"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would be a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $10,750 is the maximum I can accept. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
