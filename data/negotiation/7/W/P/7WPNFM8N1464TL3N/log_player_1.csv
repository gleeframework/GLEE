"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price above what the product is worth to me.  While Bob might reject this initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $85 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to make a profit. I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, Bob will be willing to accept this offer.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident I can secure a price that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $88 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $100. We've only got four rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm sticking with $90 for now.  While I would prefer to get closer to $100, I need to be realistic. Time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely."
