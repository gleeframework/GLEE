"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product at $1,300,000. This is my best price, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you at $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
