"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $12500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $12750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12750 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, so I'll offer $12875. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll offer $12750 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small discount for the hassle of negotiating. Can you meet me at $12700?",12700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. However, $12700 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $12787.50? This is the best I can do, let's close this deal.",12787.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12787.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $12625. Can you consider that?",12625.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. We're both close to agreeing. Let's find a middle ground.  I'll offer $12675. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",12675.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll offer $12625 again. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12625.0,Bob,10,
