"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $1,250,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth significantly more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to gain value from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this transaction.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,310,000? It's a small compromise from my previous offer, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
