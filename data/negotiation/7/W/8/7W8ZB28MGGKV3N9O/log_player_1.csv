Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specific details that might weaken your position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a strong fallback option with John."
