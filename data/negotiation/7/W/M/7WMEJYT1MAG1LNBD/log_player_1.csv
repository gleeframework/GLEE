Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if we present it as valuable and exclusive.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer of $20,000, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. This makes it more likely Bob will counter with a higher offer than he might have if we started lower.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000. This gives us leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always go down in price, but you can't go up."
