"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your target of $1,200,000, and you can still get a better deal by negotiating. 
* **There's time for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you have room to bargain and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's the worst-case scenario, as you'll pay the maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a reasonable counteroffer:**  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is significant without being overly aggressive.
* **Highlighting the benefits for Alice:**  Emphasize that this price still allows Alice to make a profit and encourages a quick agreement.
* **Staying within your budget:** $900,000 is still within your acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $950000.  This gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise, right in the middle of your counteroffer ($900,000) and her previous offer ($1,000,000).
* **Saving money:** While not the absolute lowest price, you're still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks either getting stuck at a higher price or running out of rounds, forcing you to buy from John at the highest price.

**It's a good balance of saving money and minimizing risk.**"
