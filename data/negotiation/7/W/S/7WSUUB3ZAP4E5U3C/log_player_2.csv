"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget.  It's a good starting point for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still $2,000 above your ideal price.  Since John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before committing to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer while still staying within your budget. It signals your commitment to reaching a deal, and the price is closer to your ideal price point."
