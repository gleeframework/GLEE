"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
