"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,100,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
