Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How does $12,000 sound to you?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  That leaves us both with a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,500 is a little low, but it's close enough to keep negotiating.  Let's see if we can squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is closer but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This gives us both a good margin, and lets us seal the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

$10,000 is a good price and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob. It's a fair compromise and a good profit for me."
