"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How does $12,000 sound to you?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  That leaves us both with a good profit margin.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is closer but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This gives us both a good margin, and lets us seal the deal quickly.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
