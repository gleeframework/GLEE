"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How does $12,000 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  That leaves us both with a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is closer but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This gives us both a good margin, and lets us seal the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
