"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is a better offer, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,900. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  $8,900 is almost there, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,100.  This is really my final offer, I think we can make this deal work.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $8,950. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree.  I really can't go lower than $9,050. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about buying, you need to meet me somewhere in the middle.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,050. I'm willing to make one more offer and meet you at $8,975. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8975.0,Bob,8,
