However, I have to consider my own needs and the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He should reject the offer and try to counter-offer again to lower the price further."
