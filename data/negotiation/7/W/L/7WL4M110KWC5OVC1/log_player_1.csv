Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  However, I'm confident that the product is worth more than $100 to me, so I won't accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is more than what I'd get from John, I believe the product has a higher value and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $135 is a good deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
