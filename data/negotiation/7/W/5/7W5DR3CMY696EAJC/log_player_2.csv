"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can bring you great benefit.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This product is clearly worth more to Alice than it is to you. You need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high for this product. I'm interested, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that product is worth a significant sum to me, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price but it is still too high. You can get the same product for a cheaper price from John.  You should continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's settle this now. How about $1,400,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still better off getting the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice has come down on price, but it is still higher than what John is willing to sell for. You can try to negotiate with Alice further to see if she'll go lower, but you risk running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a reasonable compromise. It's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
