"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's the best I can do, but it's still a good price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
