"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $16,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,500, which is $14,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, making it $15,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement this round.",15250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay more than $15,000. I'm willing to accept the product at this price. Is this a deal?",15000.0,Bob,8,
