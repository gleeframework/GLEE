Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you thinking of my needs.  While I do see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can still try to negotiate a lower price. Since Alice is willing to be flexible, there is room for a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I really appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm still a little over budget at $11,000.  Would you consider $10,750?  It's closer to what I can afford, and it's a fair price that splits the difference."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I have to be firm on my price.  Would you be willing to do $10,900? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is within your budget and a good deal considering your maximum willingness to pay is $12,000.  It's a better deal than buying from John."
