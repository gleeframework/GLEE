"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $8,800? That's a fair compromise, I think.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's meet halfway again at $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but the price still isn't quite right for me. How about $8,900? This is a very serious offer, and I think it's more than fair.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $8,950? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both close this deal.",8950.0,Alice,7,
