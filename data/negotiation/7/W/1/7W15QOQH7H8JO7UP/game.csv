"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,162,500.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that would benefit both of us.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
