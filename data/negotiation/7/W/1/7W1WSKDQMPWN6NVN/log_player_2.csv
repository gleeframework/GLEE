{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to negotiate and try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is the most aggressive counteroffer I can make while still staying within my financial constraints.  Alice may reject this, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear boundary for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise. It's also a good middle ground between my initial offer and her last offer. Hopefully, she'll accept this counteroffer."
