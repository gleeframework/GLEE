"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a sale, $11,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you. Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $12,500 is a bit lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal. It's worth securing the sale now rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
