"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you. Let's find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
