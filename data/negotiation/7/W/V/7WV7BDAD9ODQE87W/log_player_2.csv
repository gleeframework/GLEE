"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she is willing to sell it for less than $140. 
* You are willing to pay up to $150, so there is room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price halfway between Alice's offer of $140 and my maximum willingness to pay of $150. 
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save money. 
* It's also a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $142, which is higher than my initial counteroffer of $130.
* While this is still lower than her original offer of $140, it's getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay of $150.
* It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially save a small amount of money. 
* Buying from John for $150 is a safe option, guaranteeing I get the product without risking further negotiation."
