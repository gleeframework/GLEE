"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the asking price a bit steep. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects its value while acknowledging your offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while respecting both of our positions.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,175,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,220,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the significant value this product brings.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
