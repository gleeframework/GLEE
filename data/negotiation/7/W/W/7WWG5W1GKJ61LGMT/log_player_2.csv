# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the asking price a bit steep. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects its value while acknowledging your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while respecting both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,175,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,220,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the significant value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while there might be room for a tiny bit more negotiation, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting at $1,220,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away in future rounds."
