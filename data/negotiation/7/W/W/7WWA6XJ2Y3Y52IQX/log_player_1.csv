"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of its capabilities."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you believe in the high value of your product. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and using phrases like ""true worth,"" we aim to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While we start high, we don't want to completely alienate Bob with an outrageous initial offer. This offer leaves room for negotiation while still anchoring the discussion around a high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your starting offer, but I'm looking to make a more substantial discount. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. It's too early to accept or sell to John. We'll aim to bring him closer to $2,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desired price point, the value this product brings justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate willingness to move from our initial price.
* **Justify the Value:** We reiterate the product's value to subtly push back against further large discounts.
* **Strategic Counter:**  We're aiming for a compromise within a range we find acceptable. This offer suggests seriousness while leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested and negotiating more aggressively now. However, $1,800,000 is still below our desired outcome. We're getting closer to the point where selling to John might be necessary, but we'll try one more time to bring Bob closer to our target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** We're making it clear that this is our best offer to encourage Bob to seriously consider it. 
* **Smaller Concession:** Our price reduction is smaller this round, signaling we're nearing our limit.
* **Balance Firmness with Compromise:** We're still striving for a price above Bob's last offer, but the tone remains collaborative.
* **Time Constraint:** We're halfway through the rounds, so creating a sense of urgency is beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:**  Bob has made it clear this is his final offer.  At $1,700,000, we are too far from our $1,875,000 goal, and significantly below our initial offers. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. While it's less than we hoped for from Bob, it's a sure thing and avoids the risk of further negotiation that may not be fruitful.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has uncertain outcomes. Accepting John's offer saves time and allows us to move on. 

**It's important to recognize when to walk away from a negotiation. In this case, Bob's final offer doesn't align with our desired outcome, and John provides a more certain and timely alternative.**"
