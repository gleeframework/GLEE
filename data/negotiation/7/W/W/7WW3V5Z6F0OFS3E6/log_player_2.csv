"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and get a lower price. Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000,  rejecting the initial offer and negotiating with Alice gives him the opportunity to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $8,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects. This counteroffer tests the waters and establishes a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal.  It's also worth noting that Bob has 7 rounds left before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing some willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a significant savings from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation should Alice reject again."
