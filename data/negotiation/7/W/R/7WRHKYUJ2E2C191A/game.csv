"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. As we discussed, the product is worth $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  While $9,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
