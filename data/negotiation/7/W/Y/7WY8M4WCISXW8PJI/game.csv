"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of the product,  $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This represents a significant step towards your price and is the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the closest I can get to your price without sacrificing my minimum value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
