Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This information is incredibly valuable in setting your initial offer.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's limited risk in starting high with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message lightly justifies the high price by mentioning ""significant value"" and a ""competitive price,"" but avoids being overly aggressive. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Best-case scenario, you get a great deal!
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door to find a price between $10,000 and $19,000 that works for both of you.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and secure your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
