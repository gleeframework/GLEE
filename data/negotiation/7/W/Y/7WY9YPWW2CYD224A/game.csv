"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102?",102.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $102 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $98.50. It's a fair price for both of us.",98.5,Bob,4,
