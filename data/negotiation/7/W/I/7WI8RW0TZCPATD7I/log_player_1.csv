Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm not willing to settle for less than the product's worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below the value of the product to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a price that's worth it to me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While it's still below what I would ideally like, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
