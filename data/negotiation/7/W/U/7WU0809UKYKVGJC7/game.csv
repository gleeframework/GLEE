"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're coming up a little.  I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still just a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $8,875. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.",8875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to pay $8,750, but I was thinking maybe we could meet even closer to my budget. How about $8,750 is the top of my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. Would you be willing to consider $8,625?",8625.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm appreciating your efforts to reach a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,625.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700 as a final offer.  It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. If you reject this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John.",8700.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $8,700, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, but I'm at a maximum of $8,600. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John.",8600.0,Bob,10,
