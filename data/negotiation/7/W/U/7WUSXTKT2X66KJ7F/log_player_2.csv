"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $125. This is a special opportunity as it is valued at $150 by you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while allowing us to reach an agreeable transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However, $125 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. I am proposing to sell the product for $115 instead of $125. This price still reflects the product's worth to me while being more in line with your offer. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within my budget and a better price than John's.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate."
