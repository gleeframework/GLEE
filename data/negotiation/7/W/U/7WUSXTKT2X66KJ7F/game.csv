"Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $125. This is a special opportunity as it is valued at $150 by you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while allowing us to reach an agreeable transaction.",125.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However, $125 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. I am proposing to sell the product for $115 instead of $125. This price still reflects the product's worth to me while being more in line with your offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",115.0,Alice,3,
