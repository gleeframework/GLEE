Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", ""product_price"": 2300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchor the Value:** By starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you aim to anchor the negotiation around a higher number.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you gauge how eager Bob is to acquire the product and how flexible he might be on price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for a more reasonable price, closer to  $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer, you can try to move the price closer to a more favorable outcome for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,550,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial interest."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still above your minimum, this counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to the middle ground. 
* **Holding Firm:**  The price is still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing that you're not willing to part with the product at a significantly discounted price.
* **Time Pressure:** By staying relatively close to your fallback option (selling to John), you subtly introduce a sense of time pressure for Bob to make a more competitive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,550,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his perceived value of the product. This is a positive sign, showing he's serious about the purchase. However, you still have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  There's potential to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. How about we settle this right now at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer presents a price significantly above Bob's current offer but below your guaranteed option with John. It aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal.
* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer and labeling this as your final offer, you introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slightly):**  While presented as final, the $1,200,000 offer still leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter with a slightly higher price if he's very keen on acquiring the product."
