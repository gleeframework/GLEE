"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. My initial price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $98.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98}
``` 
 
I'm sticking to my goal of getting as close to $100 as possible.  This counteroffer is still well above my minimum price, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully we can reach an agreement this round."
