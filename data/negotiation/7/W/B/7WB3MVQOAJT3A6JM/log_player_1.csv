Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,250,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
