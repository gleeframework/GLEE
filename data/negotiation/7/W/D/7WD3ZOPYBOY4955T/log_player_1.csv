Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this price is fair considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement without having to involve John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price point. I'll accept this offer to secure the sale."
