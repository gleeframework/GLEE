"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's talk about $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $120
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **John's price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $20 compared to buying from John. Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, it's still a good deal for Bob, as he gets a product worth $120 to him for $100."
