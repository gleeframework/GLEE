"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is over Bob's budget, and he has other options. He can counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price for a product that's worth so much to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price that's closer to both our desired numbers."", ""product_price"": 12500}
