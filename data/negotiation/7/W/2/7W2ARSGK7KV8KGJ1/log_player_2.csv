"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product, tailored specifically to meet your needs and expectations, is priced at $950,000. I believe this figure strikes a balance between reflecting its true worth and ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value ($950,000 vs. $800,000).** This means there is still room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is the worst option as it costs the most ($1,200,000).** 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price.** You can then try to get closer to Alice's value, or at least a price lower than $950,000."
