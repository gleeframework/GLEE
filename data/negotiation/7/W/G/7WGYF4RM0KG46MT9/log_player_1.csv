This offer gives Bob a good price point while still allowing me to earn significantly more than what he values the product at. This strategy keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, as I am confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:

While $862,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
