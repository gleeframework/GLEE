"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
