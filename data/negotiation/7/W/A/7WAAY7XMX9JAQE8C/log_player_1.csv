{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still leaving a good profit margin.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's potential value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still give me a decent margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum, it's more efficient to sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
