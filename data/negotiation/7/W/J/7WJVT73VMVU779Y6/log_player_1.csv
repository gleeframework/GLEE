Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth far more than the asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit beyond your minimum ($800,000).
* **Value emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob justifies the high price and creates a sense of urgency. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  Subtly mentioning other interested parties (John) adds pressure on Bob to accept, even though you're willing to accept less from John.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by:

* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** Bob is more likely to pay more if he believes the product is worth significantly more to him.
* **Creating urgency:** The limited-time offer and mention of other buyers encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the starting price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a price higher than John's offer."
