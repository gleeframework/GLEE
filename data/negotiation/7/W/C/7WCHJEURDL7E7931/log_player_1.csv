"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $145. It's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $135 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140.  This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum and hopefully encouraging Bob to meet me halfway."
