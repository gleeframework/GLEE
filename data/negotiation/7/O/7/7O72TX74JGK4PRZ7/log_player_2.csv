"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $900,000.  This is a significant price reduction from its true value, and I believe it's a deal you can't refuse.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
