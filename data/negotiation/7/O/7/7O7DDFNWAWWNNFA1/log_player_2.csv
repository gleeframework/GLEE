"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There is still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's find common ground and close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:**  $800,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Current Offer:** $937,500 

At this point, Bob is close to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  While there's still a bit of room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,200,000 outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that is significantly lower than John's offer, while still leaving Alice with a reasonable profit margin."
