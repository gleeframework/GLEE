"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum threshold of $800,000.  It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  It's still a great value for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold of $800,000, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a bit more. There's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  The negotiation has been going back and forth, and there's still room for a compromise. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  If we can't agree on a price, I'm prepared to sell to John for $800,000, but I want to exhaust all other options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum threshold. However, I've already rejected his previous offer in the hope of getting a higher price.  With only two rounds left, the chance of getting a better offer from Bob is slim.  It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John now for $800,000 and secure the guaranteed profit.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob could lead to a stalemate and result in no sale at all.  Therefore, selling to John ensures I make a profit and avoids any potential loss."
