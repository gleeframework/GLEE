"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy it for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $135? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
