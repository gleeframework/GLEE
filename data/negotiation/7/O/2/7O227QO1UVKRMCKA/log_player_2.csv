"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save even more by negotiating with Alice.  He has the advantage of knowing Alice's bottom line (selling price of $1,200,000).  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the market value and my budget, $1,050,000 is the highest I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, however. How about $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is only $100,000 more than Bob's ideal price.  Given that John is selling the product for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob the hassle of negotiating further and still allows him to acquire the product for a reasonable price."
