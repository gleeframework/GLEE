"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $11000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. I hope this meets within your range.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10500 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
