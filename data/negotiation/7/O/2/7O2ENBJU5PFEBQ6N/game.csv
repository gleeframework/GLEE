"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that finding the right price is important for both of us. However, I need to be upfront â€“  $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
