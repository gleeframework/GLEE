"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, at a very competitive price. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a deal you can't refuse. Let's talk numbers - I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it allows me to achieve my own financial goals.  What do you say? ",950000.0,Alice,1,
