"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage the offer from John to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at a much lower cost."
