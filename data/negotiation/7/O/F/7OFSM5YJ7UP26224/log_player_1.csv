Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible (the price John will pay). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $400,000 in value ($1,400,000 offer vs. $1,000,000 actual worth).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
