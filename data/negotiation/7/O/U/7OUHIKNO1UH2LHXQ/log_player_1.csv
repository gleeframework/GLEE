Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I emphasize the value proposition and try to make it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm prepared to negotiate and don't want to close the door on a deal by starting too low.
* **Having a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum ensures I won't settle for less than my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for such a drastic reduction. I'll make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a reasonable reduction:** I'm reducing my price significantly from the previous offer, showing flexibility. However, I'm still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's worth to emphasize its value to Bob.
* **Expressing willingness to negotiate:** I show that I am still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that undervalues the product for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $950,000 is still below my target.  I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm making one final offer to show that I'm still willing to negotiate, but this is my limit.
* **Bridging the gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I reiterate the value proposition to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Clear decision point:** I make it clear that this is my final offer, setting the stage for a decision."
