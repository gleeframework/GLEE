{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. My asking price is $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep in mind the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I believe I can still get closer to my target price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Explore Further:** I can gauge Bob's real budget and see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate to sell, which can strengthen my position in the negotiation. 

I'll now counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the product's value and gives us a good starting point.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially move closer to my desired price.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is just $500 below my minimum acceptable price. Given that he has shown a willingness to negotiate and that I'm close to my goal, I'm willing to accept his offer. 

* **Close to Minimum:** Accepting his offer secures a sale at a price that is only slightly below my minimum, minimizing potential losses.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might take more time and energy, potentially leading to a stalemate. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I keep rejecting, Bob might lose interest or decide to go elsewhere, risking a lower sale price or even no sale.

By accepting Bob's offer, I achieve a satisfactory result without risking a worse outcome."
