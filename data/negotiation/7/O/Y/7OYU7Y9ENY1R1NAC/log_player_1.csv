Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from a strong position.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, it seems like he's not willing to go higher. Selling to John at $800,000 is my best option at this point, guaranteeing me my minimum value."
