"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for your consideration. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a great asset. My initial price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This would allow me to accept your offer and still get a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
