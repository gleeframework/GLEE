"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $230. What do you think?",230.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $230 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $230 is already a significant discount on what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway at $155? ",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $100.  To be fair, how about we settle at $130?  That's a pretty significant price drop from my initial offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $100. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
