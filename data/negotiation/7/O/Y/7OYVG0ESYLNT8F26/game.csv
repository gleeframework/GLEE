"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price, and you'll be getting a valuable asset for a price you're comfortable with. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This way, you're getting the product for your target price, and I'm getting a fair deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $950000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $950000. However, I'm still a bit too far away from my minimum price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $975000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned about the possibility of not reaching a deal. While I appreciate your continued negotiation, $975000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you one last time in the middle, at $1025000. This would be a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and I can finally close this deal. Let me know your final decision.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
