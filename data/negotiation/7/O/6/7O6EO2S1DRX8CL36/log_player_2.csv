"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll be able to see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, potentially pushing her closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000."
