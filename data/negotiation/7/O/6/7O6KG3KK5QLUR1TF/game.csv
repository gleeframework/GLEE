"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great addition to your business. I'm asking for $17,500 for it.  What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $14,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down slightly, though. I'd be happy to accept $16,000 for the product. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $16,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",15200.0,Bob,4,
