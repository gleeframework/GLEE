Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but within a reasonable range, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a good profit while leaving a space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $725,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need us to be closer to that number for this deal to make sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $755,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $755,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get closer to $800,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I still make a decent profit."
