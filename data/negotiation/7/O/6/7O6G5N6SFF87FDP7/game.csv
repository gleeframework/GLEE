"Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $725,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need us to be closer to that number for this deal to make sense for me.",755000.0,Bob,6,
