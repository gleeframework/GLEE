"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to establish a strong starting point in the negotiation. By offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget, we leave room for negotiation while signaling our serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further.  We're closer to John's price than Alice's current offer. Let's see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $725,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

This counteroffer strategically positions us closer to a potential agreement. We acknowledge Alice's movement while proposing a price that's a significant jump from our last offer, indicating our desire to finalize the deal. This approach aims to encourage Alice to meet us closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice claiming ""halfway"" isn't accurate, and we're still quite close to John's price.  We'll push a bit further, but this is getting risky."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need us to be closer to that number for this deal to make sense for me."",
""product_price"": 755000
}
``` 

This counteroffer introduces a sense of urgency and transparency by revealing John's offer. By being slightly below John's price, we signal our genuine preference for Alice's product while emphasizing the need for a more competitive price to justify continuing the negotiation with her. This approach aims to encourage Alice to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
