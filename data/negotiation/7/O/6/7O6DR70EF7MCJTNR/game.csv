"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is simply not feasible. Let's try a more realistic figure. Would you consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $900,000.  This offer reflects the maximum I'm willing to spend.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point. How about $1,750,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a significant investment on my part and reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
