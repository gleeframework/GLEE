Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I believe it's a great deal, given its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $150. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason:Bob is offering $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I have another buyer (John) willing to pay the same amount. There's no benefit to potentially negotiating further with Bob, risking him lowering his offer. Selling to John guarantees me the $150."
