"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. While $115 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $95? That's a significant jump from my initial offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me somewhere in the middle.  How about $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $98? That's me really trying to meet you halfway.",98.0,Bob,6,
