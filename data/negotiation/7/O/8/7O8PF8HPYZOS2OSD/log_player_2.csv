# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking for a price below $8,000, and Alice's offer is too high. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,700?  This would give you a great deal, and I'd still be able to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

You should buy the product from John. Even though Alice's offer is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your limit of $8,000. John offers the product for exactly your maximum price, so it's the best option."
