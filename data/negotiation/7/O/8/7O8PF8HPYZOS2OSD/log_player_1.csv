"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  While $8,200 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000."
