"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
