Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate and potentially get closer to his value.

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to negotiate further. Here's why:

* **You have leverage:** Bob clearly wants the product and has already shown his willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for higher price:** You can potentially get closer to your desired $140, or at least a price slightly above $120.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, you can still sell to John for $120 as a safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's still a good price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You've acknowledged Bob's desire for a lower price and are willing to compromise.
* **Maintain profit:** $130 is still above your minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **Be attractive to Bob:**  $130 is halfway between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, potentially appealing to his desire for a fair deal.

By proposing a compromise and providing a compelling argument, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer."
