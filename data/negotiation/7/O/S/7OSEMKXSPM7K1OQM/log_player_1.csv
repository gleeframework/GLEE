Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at $90.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as he values the product at $80.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $70 is below my minimum price of $80. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my minimum price and his offer. I believe this is a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further. I'm also concerned that further negotiation might take too much time. I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and it's not guaranteed that I'll be able to secure a price that's worth my while. 

To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. This is a sure thing, and it guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement."
