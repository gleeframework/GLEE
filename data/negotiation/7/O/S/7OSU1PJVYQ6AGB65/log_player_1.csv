"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. If we can agree on that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I believe I can negotiate further with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to $140. I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $150 as I see a possibility of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I can only go down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
