"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. If we can agree on that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I can only go down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,5,
