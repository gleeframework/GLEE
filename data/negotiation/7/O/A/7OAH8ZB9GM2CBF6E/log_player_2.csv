"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum price, but Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At $10,250, Bob is still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise and a reasonable price for the product."
