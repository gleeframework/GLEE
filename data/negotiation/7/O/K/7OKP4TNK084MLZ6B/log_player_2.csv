# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is still a good compromise. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to your ideal price. There's no guarantee you can get a better deal, and continuing the negotiation might lead to her raising the price again."
