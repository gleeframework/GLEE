"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
