"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You're still in a good position to negotiate further.  You can likely get Alice to come down a bit more from $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
