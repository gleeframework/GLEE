{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so she is already willing to sell for a loss.  I will try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to keep the price below $900,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above my desired range.  I'll reject her offer and try one more time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm raising my offer again to $890,000.  This is getting closer to Alice's last offer and shows her that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still within my budget and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and I'm not seeing much progress from Alice.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's higher than I want to pay.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
