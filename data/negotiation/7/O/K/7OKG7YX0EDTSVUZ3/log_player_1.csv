Send your offer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from on the value, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could we try for $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is moving closer to our desired price range, indicating willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To show I'm serious about making this work, I can come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  We're holding firm above the $1 million mark to signal the product's value while making a significant concession to entice Bob.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we add pressure for Bob to accept and avoid prolonged negotiation.
* **Alternative:** We're still well above John's $800,000 offer, giving us a safety net if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your final offer is tempting, however, I can't quite meet that number. My absolute maximum is $990,000.  If you're unable to accept that, I understand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $990,000 is a significant profit margin, only slightly below our ""final offer"" and well above John's offer.
* **Bob's limit:** Bob has signaled this is his absolute maximum, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Time value:** Accepting now avoids potential delays and secures the deal, acknowledging the ""bird in the hand"" principle."
