"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than the value you placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand that we're both trying to get the best deal possible. To show you my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $12,300. This is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12300.0,Alice,7,
