"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the optimal choice."
