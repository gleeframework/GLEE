"Bob, I understand your position. While your offer is appreciated, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow us to complete the transaction. Let's find a way to make this work!",16500.0,Alice,3,
