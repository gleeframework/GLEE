Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still allowing you to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
