"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a high but not unreasonable price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to him, so this price, while high, is within the realm of potential negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest and Flexibility:** By starting high, I can gauge Bob's initial reaction. If he immediately counters with a much lower offer, I'll know he's very price-sensitive.  If he negotiates closer to my initial offer, I have more leverage.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 offer leaves ample room for me to come down in price over subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Politeness and Enthusiasm:** Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone throughout the negotiation is key to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a decent counteroffer, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to dedicate a few more rounds to try and reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the significant value it will bring to your business in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. However, this reduction is still within a range that keeps me well above my absolute minimum.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:** I'm emphasizing the long-term value and benefits the product offers Bob's business. This can help shift the focus from a purely price-based negotiation to one that considers overall return on investment.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to establish a middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds, should Bob reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  He's indicated this is his ""final offer,"" which is often a negotiation tactic. I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since I have the security of John's offer. I'll use the next round to see if I can push Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is just too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal today. If you're willing to agree to $1,550,000, I'm prepared to finalize the paperwork today.  This offer is only valid for the next 24 hours, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm, but Fair:** I'm holding my ground just above my absolute minimum, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By introducing a 24-hour deadline and mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without directly referencing John), I'm subtly increasing the perceived value and encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise slightly above my minimum, but I won't go lower. This approach aims to either secure a deal now or lead Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not willing to pay $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. He's sticking to the ""final offer"" tactic, and his latest offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially leave money on the table, it's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

It's important to recognize when further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful. I've made a good-faith effort to reach an agreement with Bob, but it's time to move on to a buyer who values the product at or above my minimum."
