"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth much more than that! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there? "", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his desired price point.  He's aiming for a price close to Alice's value, but still below his own maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob ideally wants to pay less, Alice's offer of $120 is a good compromise.  It's still below Bob's maximum of $150 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product and move on to other things."
