Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($12,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring Bias:**  By suggesting a high initial price, you might influence Bob's perception of the product's value, making a slightly lower counter-offer more appealing.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once the offer is made."
