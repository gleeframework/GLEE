"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
