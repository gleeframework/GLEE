"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Would you consider $1,200,000?  This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
