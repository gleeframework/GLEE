"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is strategically chosen for a few reasons:

* **Aggressive Start:** It immediately tells Alice I'm looking for a significantly lower price.
* **Targeting My Ideal:**  While I want to save money, I'm aiming close to my perceived value to maximize the chances of a deal. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This first counter-offer helps me understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget, I am now offering the product for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved down from her initial offer, indicating some willingness to negotiate. 
* However, $10,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and her known value for the product.  
* Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to continue pushing for a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer proposes a price directly between our previous offers, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying Above Her Value:** $9,000 is still a profitable price for Alice, while getting me closer to a more acceptable range.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm avoiding large jumps in my counter-offers, showing Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try and force my hand. While she might be bluffing, there's a risk she'll walk away.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $9,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's above Alice's value, ensuring a deal for her, but also a significant savings compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate risks either running out of rounds or pushing Alice away entirely. Accepting now secures the product at a decent price."
