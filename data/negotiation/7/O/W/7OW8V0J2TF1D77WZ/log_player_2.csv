You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's no harm in seeing if she might be willing to lower it slightly. There's a chance she might budge to make the sale, and you'll get a better deal. If not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
