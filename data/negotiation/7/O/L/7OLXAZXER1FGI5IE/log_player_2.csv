"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price.  However,  I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would still represent a significant saving for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than what John is selling it for, and it's only $100,000 more than my counteroffer. There's a chance I could get a lower price by counteroffering again, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it.  I'll accept Alice's offer and save $400,000 compared to buying from John."
