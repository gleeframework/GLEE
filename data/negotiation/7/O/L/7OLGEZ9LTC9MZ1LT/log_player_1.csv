Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $150, Bob would definitely reject it. By offering it at a lower price, you increase the chance of Bob accepting and you still make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but might be tempting enough for him to consider. It leaves room for negotiation but ensures you're covered if he declines.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
