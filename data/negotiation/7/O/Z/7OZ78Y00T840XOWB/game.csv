"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you be able to accommodate this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
