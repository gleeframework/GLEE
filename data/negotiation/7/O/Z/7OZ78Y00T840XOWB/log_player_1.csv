Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not offering the minimum of $15,000, I open the possibility for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **The ""John"" factor:** Knowing I have a backup buyer willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage. If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is $5,000 lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Leverage with John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $15,000.  There's no reason to settle for a significantly lower price with Bob.
* **Potential for counter-negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer that might be closer to my desired price point. 

**Next step:** I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than my ideal price.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving up completely.  I'm leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob still refuses, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering the value of the product and my budget, I am still unable to go beyond $10,000. Is there any way we could meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is sticking to his $10,000 offer. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and me losing the sale to another buyer is high.

**Conclusion:** It's more beneficial to secure the sale with John, ensuring I get my desired price without the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob."
