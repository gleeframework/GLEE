Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price allows for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** A $200,000 difference provides room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept immediately.
* **John as Backup:** Having John's offer as a fallback ensures I don't have to settle for less than my minimum if Bob proves difficult. 

**Strategy:**

I'll be willing to negotiate, but I won't budge below $1,500,000. I'll use John's offer as a reference point during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's room for me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob become too difficult, I can still fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. This will allow for further negotiation while keeping me closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still too far below my expectations.  Let's try $1,150,000.  It's a fair compromise that meets us halfway.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:** It's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, allowing for further negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not giving away too much, keeping room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a gradual approach, inching closer to Bob's desired price while still maintaining a profitable margin.  My goal is to find a price that satisfies both of us, but I won't budge below $1,500,000 if needed."
