"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do any better on the price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $1,000,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
