"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,650.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",10650.0,Alice,5,
