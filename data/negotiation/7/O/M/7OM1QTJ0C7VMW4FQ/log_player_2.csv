"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer of $11,500 is close to my limit, I can try negotiating a lower price. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down closer to $10,000 before I resort to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I'm still comfortable pushing a bit further. The difference between her offer and John's price is significant enough to warrant another counteroffer."

""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,650.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has met me almost exactly in the middle. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I risk losing out on the deal entirely. Accepting $10,650 is a reasonable compromise and saves me some money compared to her initial offer."
