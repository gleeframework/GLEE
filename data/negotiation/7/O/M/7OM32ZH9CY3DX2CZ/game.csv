"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a more reasonable price for me.,105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $106.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves us both satisfied.  What do you think?",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $104, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's the lowest price I'm willing to pay for this product.",104.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $104 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $105.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not sure I want to pay $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $103. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",103.0,Bob,8,
