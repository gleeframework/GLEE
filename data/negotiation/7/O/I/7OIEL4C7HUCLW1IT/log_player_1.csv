{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum while still leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. You can likely get closer to your initial offer with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? I believe that's a fair price that still gives you a good value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
