Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than the $10,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's less than your minimum of $15,000, meaning you still have room to negotiate if needed. 
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  Both you and Bob have some space to negotiate, making a deal more likely. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
