"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $8500. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

This price reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm ready to offer $9200. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $9200 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9350. This price reflects the product's value, and we can finalize the deal before the time limit runs out.  What do you think?",9350.0,Alice,7,
