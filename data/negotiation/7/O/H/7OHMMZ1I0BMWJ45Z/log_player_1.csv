Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $9,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can get closer to $10,000 with another round of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting closer, I'm still confident that I can secure a price closer to my desired $10,000.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,300. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9300}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal!  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This price reflects both our needs and allows us to finalize the transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at $9,200 than risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $8,000."
