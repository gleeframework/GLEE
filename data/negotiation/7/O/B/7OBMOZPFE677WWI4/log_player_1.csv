"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob that I value the product highly.  I'm confident in the product's worth and believe that Bob will be tempted by the potential value.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering $975,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot,  encouraging Bob to close the deal before we go any further."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm confident that I can push for a better price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000.  This is a bit closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding firm on my value for the product.  I think this is a fair compromise and hopefully, Bob will see it that way too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I believe I can get a better price. It's getting more risky, but I'm going to try and push for a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $935,000. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses.  With only a few rounds left, I don't think I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's still significantly more than my minimum.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing out altogether."
