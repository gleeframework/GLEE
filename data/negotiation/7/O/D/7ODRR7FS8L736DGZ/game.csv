"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000.
