Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
