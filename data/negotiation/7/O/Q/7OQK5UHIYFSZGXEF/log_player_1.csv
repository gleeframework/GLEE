Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I've also kept the message friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective,  $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. My counteroffer is still a bit higher than his offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
