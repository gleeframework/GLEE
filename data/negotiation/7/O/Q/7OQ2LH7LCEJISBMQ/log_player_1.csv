Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes a perceived higher value. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  You can always adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and any subsequent negotiations."
