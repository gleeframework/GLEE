You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, potentially achieving a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,500. This counteroffer is still within Bob's maximum budget of $8,000, while also leaving some room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, so it's the safest and most financially beneficial option."
