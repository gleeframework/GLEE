"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $125. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer with a price of $130. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,5,
