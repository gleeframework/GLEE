"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since we have 10 rounds and know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, we can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $100,000 drop from her initial price is a strong signal that we're serious about getting a good deal.  We'll see if she's willing to meet us halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price and within our target range.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of her getting stubborn or us running out of rounds.  At this point, accepting her offer saves us $150,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a good deal overall."
