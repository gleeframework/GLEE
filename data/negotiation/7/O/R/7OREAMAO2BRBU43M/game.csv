"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
