"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could be flexible and come down to $1,080,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a strong alternative buyer.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,080,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Bob,4,
