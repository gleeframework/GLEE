"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob's business. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy in the subsequent rounds. I also keep in mind the ""John"" option, which provides a baseline value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer would be the same as selling to John.  
* **Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a higher price, but I need to be careful not to push Bob away.
* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 

**Note:** I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer. I'll consider Bob's message and try to gauge how much he's truly willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the mutual benefit of the deal, emphasizing that it's a win-win scenario.
* **Clarity:** The counteroffer is clear and specific, making it easy for Bob to understand my position.

**Note:**  I'm keeping a close eye on the value of the product to me, and the fact that I can sell to John for $800,000. If Bob doesn't budge on his price, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $900000. How about we try $850000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing. 
* **Time:**  We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left to reach an agreement. 
* **John's offer:** Selling to John would yield the same amount, and I'm not guaranteed a better offer in the remaining rounds.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the risk of further negotiation, the time constraint, and the value of the product, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
