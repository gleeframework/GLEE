"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but it's a bit more in line with what I'm looking for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to pay $11,250 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11750.0,Alice,5,
