"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? Let me know your thoughts.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $11,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit above my target price. Let's try $11,000. It's a reasonable midpoint and we can both save some money.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to reach your minimum price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  To show good faith, I'll offer $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal. Let's make it happen!",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $12,000 earlier. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll stick with my previous offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
