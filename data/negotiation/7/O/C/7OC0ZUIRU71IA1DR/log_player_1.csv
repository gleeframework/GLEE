Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's continue to negotiate and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my desired price point and within my acceptable range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John in the future if this negotiation fails. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
