Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be immensely beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than our fallback option (John).
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Alternative in Play:**  We don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price, as we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. 
 
This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
