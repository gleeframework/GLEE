"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product could be immensely beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John at the lower price."
