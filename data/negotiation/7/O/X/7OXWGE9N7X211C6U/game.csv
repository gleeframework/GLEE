"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $180? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and features it offers.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $160, which is a bit above your budget, but still a fair price for the product's value. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's worth considering.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone quite low, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $157.50, which is a small compromise, but still a fair price for the product's value. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's worth considering.",157.5,Alice,7,
