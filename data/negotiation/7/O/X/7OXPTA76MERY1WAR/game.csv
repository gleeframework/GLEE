"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value you place on it, and it ensures a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this price is fair considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $950,000 is closer, but I'm hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $975,000? It's a fair compromise that bridges the gap between our offers and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
