"I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1480000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1480000.0,Alice,5,
