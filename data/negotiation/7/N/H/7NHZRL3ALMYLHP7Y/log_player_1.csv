While I'm getting close to my minimum price of $100, I'm still going to reject this offer. I feel like there's still room to negotiate, and I don't want to sell for less than I think it's worth. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired amount and hope we can reach an agreement."

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm still slightly disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob, I don't want to risk getting a worse deal, especially since I'm down to the last two rounds.  John's offer is a guaranteed $100, which is a good price considering my minimum."
