"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon!",90.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $87.50? That's the lowest I can go.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  While $87.50 isn't quite what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $90?  I'm feeling pretty confident we can make this work.",90.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about we try $88? That's the lowest I can go.",88.0,Bob,8,
