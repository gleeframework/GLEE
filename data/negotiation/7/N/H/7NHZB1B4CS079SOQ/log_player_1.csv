"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable starting point above my minimum value of $120. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is above my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, giving us both a chance to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is only $5 away from my initial offer of $140.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still above my minimum value and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
