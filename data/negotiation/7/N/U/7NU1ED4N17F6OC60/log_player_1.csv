Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal,  $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,450,000 is closer to my goal, I still want to see if I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,525,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,450,000 and $1,525,000, which would be $1,487,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can we discuss this further?
