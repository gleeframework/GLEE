"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to start by seeing if you can get a better price. You can always go with John if you can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
