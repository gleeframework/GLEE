{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for bargaining. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  I will counteroffer to try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the product is worth less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to meet my goals. I've already reached the point where I'm comfortable taking the guaranteed offer from John.  I'll sell the product to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
