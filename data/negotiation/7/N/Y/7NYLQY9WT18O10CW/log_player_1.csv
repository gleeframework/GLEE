Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000) leaves potential profit on the table. A price of $1,150,000:
    *  Gives Bob a reason to consider: It's a saving compared to you going with another buyer.
    *  Provides you a significant profit margin: $150,000 more than Bob values it.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a little pressure for Bob to act quickly and not lose the opportunity."
