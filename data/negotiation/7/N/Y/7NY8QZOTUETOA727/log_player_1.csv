Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about $1,800,000? This offer represents a substantial discount from my initial asking price and could be a profitable venture for you."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise that allows us both to potentially benefit from this deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not worth risking going further. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, and securing that price is the best choice in this scenario."
