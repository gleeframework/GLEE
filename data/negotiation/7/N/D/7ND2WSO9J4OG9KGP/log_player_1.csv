I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll see how Bob responds."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price."
