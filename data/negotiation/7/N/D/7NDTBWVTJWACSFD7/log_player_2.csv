"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your operations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $15,000 is closer to what I can do, I'm still aiming to stay under $13,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay under $13,000, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your operations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can secure a better deal. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down even more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay under your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering $14,250, which is still above Bob's ideal price point.  While there's still room for negotiation, Bob has only three rounds left.  At this point, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and being left with no product is too high. Buying from John for $10,000 ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
