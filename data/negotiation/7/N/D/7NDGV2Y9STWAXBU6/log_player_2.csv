"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My asking price is $1,200,000. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still represents a significant gain for you and a good profit for me. Let's work together to close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to $900,000.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is not a viable option at this point."
