Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit. Since I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, I want to aim for a price higher than that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering a price of $1,500,000 presents a balance. It's significantly higher than my minimum, increasing potential profit. However, it also carries a higher risk of rejection.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the leverage to offer a higher price, knowing I can still secure a decent profit. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is a potential buyer with an unknown value for the product. By offering a higher price, I encourage him to consider if it's worth it to him. 

**Important Note:**  The optimal price is a strategic decision that depends on my assessment of Bob's potential value for the product.  This offer is a starting point, and I may adjust it based on Bob's response or further information."
