"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's still a fair price for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $975,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and represents a fair value for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you have a budget, but $960,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $960,000 and $965,000, so how about $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,8,
