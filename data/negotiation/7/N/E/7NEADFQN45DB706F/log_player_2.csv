"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to accept an offer above that. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Beginning with a significantly lower offer ($80) leaves room for negotiation. It also gauges Alice's willingness to move from her initial price.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, crucial for a successful negotiation. We want to encourage Alice to continue the conversation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Limit:** Alice has come down to your maximum price of $100. 
* **No Point in Delay:**  Since you can buy it from John at the same price, there's no benefit in trying to haggle further and risking losing the deal with Alice."
