Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and I'm willing to sell it for no less than $120. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum price, and it's likely he won't go higher.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
