"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 at this time.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
