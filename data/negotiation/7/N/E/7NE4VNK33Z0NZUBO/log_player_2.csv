Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go down to $10,000.  She's holding firm around $11,000, and we're only likely to save a small amount at best by continuing to negotiate.  John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which meets my needs without further risk of the negotiation failing."
