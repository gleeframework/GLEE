Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $14,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so we need to offer a price that's attractive, but not too low.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John at $15,000, giving us leverage.

By offering the product at $14,500, we're aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal (saving $500 from our backup offer)."
