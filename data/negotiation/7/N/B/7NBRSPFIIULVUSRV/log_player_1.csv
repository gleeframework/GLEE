I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,425,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to give away too much."

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway, but it's still above my minimum, so I'm not losing out."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can push for a better price.  It's risky to keep going, and John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum. It's time to sell to John."
