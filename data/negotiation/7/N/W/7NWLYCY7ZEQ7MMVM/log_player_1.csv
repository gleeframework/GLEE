"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, knowing the product is worth at least $120 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your effort, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Even though Bob offered my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and could potentially get a higher price in the next round.
* **Avoiding ""Selling to John"":**  While selling to John guarantees $120, I'm aiming for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $135, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to increase pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm stating my price clearly and leaving no room for ambiguity."
