Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves a $2,000 profit margin, significantly more than what you'd get from John.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""special price"" phrasing implies the offer might not last, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Not Too High:** While you want to maximize profit,  a price too close to $15,000 risks immediate rejection, forcing you to go to John.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price beneficial to you while still being appealing enough for him to accept."
