"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good deal.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm aiming for a significant profit.  However, if he rejects, I'm ready to negotiate and eventually consider the backup offer from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $875,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to accept."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price than Bob's offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell for $825,000 yet.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a good price for both of us and hopefully, he'll accept. If not, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $820,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While selling to John is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 830000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $830,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to close the deal.  I'm feeling the pressure to close this deal, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob. I'm not confident we can reach a deal that satisfies my minimum goal. Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of losing more money in further negotiations."
