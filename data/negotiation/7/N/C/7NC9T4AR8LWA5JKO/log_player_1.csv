{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price but gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer again, and ultimately, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is well below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $11,500. This is still a fantastic price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,000 is close enough to my minimum.  It's also a fair compromise with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
