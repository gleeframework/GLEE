"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer $11,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate.  $12,800 is a decent price, but Bob can likely still get a slightly better deal. He should counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little hesitant. I'm willing to offer $12,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer back to $13,000, which is a fair price for Bob considering his valuation of $15,000.  While he could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and he'll end up paying $15,000 to John. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
