Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This approach aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for compromise to hopefully secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation while being closer to my desired price point."
