I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my value of $15,000 than Bob's value of $12,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a good amount for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but I'm willing to lower the price slightly to try and reach an agreement."
