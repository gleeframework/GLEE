Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a higher price than what I'm guaranteed to get from John, giving me the potential to earn more.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, there's also a potential for a higher profit.
* **Unknown Value:** I don't know Bob's value for the product. A higher offer gives him more incentive to accept, especially if he values it closer to $15,000 or higher.
* **Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, this sets a starting point for negotiation. I can then lower the price slightly and see if he's willing to accept. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while acknowledging the risk of a rejection."
