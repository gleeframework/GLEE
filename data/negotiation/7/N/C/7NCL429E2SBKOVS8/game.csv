"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  To begin the conversation, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000 to start our negotiations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that makes it worth considerably more. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your belief in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we bridge the gap a bit further? I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to see this product in your hands.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
