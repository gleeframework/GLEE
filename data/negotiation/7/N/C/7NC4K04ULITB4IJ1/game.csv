"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $100? This seems like a fair compromise, considering we both want to reach an agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and go with $97.50. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",97.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you halfway between $95 and $97.50, which would be $96.25. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",96.25,Bob,8,
