"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. Can we shake on it?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $11,500. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John for $15,000.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
