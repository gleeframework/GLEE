Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point that aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation:** This encourages Bob to engage and avoids making him feel pressured. 

Remember, my goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I can't get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving from my initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000 to show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so I'm not losing out on anything if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** My message emphasizes fairness and mutually beneficial outcomes, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will get Bob closer to my desired price. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. Can we shake on it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I can't get a better deal with Bob.

**Next step:** I will send Bob a final counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still above my minimum. I will make it clear that this is my final offer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $11,500. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John for $15,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last offer, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.
* **Small concession:** I'm only moving down $500 from my previous offer, showing that I'm not budging much further.
* **Clear ultimatum:** I explicitly state that I'll sell to John if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I remind Bob that this is a good deal for him compared to selling to John for $15,000.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:** I'm still earning more than Bob's perceived value and closer to my desired price.
* **Force a decision:** I'm putting the ball in Bob's court, leaving him with a clear choice. 
* **Prepare for a possible sale to John:**  I'm ready to move on to John if Bob doesn't accept."
