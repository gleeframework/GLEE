Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before I consider selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get him to increase his offer just a bit more. I'm not ready to settle yet.  I have a few more rounds left, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at a more agreeable price."

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating. John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a much better deal than what I can get from Bob at this point."
