"Alice,  $20000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12000. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $12000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer at $10000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go lower than $10000, but I'm really pushing my budget with that price.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $8000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the lowest I can go. I'll make one more compromise: I'll meet you at $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,7,
