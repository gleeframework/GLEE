Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I've tried to be flexible with my pricing. However, $11,800 is simply too low for me to accept. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.
