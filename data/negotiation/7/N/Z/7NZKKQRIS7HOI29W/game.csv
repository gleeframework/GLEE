"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable opportunity, and I believe it could be worth $1,500,000 to you.  To start, I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to your business. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This offer is firm, but I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
