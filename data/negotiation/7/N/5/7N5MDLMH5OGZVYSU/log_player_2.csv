"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value, and I believe you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her own valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and secure a better deal with John."
