Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him a potential ""bargain"" feeling. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going for the full $10,000 right away, as it's likely Bob will try to negotiate down. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me a solid base to refuse any offers lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $8,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested. This gives me a chance to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John is still an option:** If this negotiation doesn't go well, I can always fall back to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a huge amount. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. 
* **Maintain room for further negotiation:**  If Bob still pushes for a lower price, I can still go down a bit, but I'm not giving away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $800 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for higher counter-offer:** While I could counteroffer, it's likely Bob won't go higher.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'd have to settle with John for $8,000. 

It's a gamble, but accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial choice in this scenario."
