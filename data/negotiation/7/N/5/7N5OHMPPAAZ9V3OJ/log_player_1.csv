Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be very valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but not excessively high. This might pique his interest and make him consider it. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer is still significantly below what John is willing to pay ($150), ensuring a profit for Alice.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
