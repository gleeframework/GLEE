I'm not sure if Bob is truly interested in buying. He seems to be playing a game of lowballing.  I'm going to counteroffer, but I'm also considering selling to John if this round doesn't produce a better result."

While $1,700,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not confident that Bob will budge any further, and I've reached the final round.  Selling to John ensures I get at least my minimum acceptable price, and I can avoid further negotiation with Bob."
