"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you have a budget to stick to. While $12,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about $13,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
