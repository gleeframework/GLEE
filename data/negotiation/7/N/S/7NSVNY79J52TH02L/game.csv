"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you at $900000. Considering its value and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but that's as low as I can go. This price reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value. If not, I'm happy to explore other options. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,,
