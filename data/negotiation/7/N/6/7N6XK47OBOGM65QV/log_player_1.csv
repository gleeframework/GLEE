Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle.
* **""Limited Time"" Tactic:** This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly."
