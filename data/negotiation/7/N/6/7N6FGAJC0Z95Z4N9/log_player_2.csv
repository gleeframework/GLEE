Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and while there might be a small amount of room left to negotiate, it's getting risky.  Accepting at $800,000 secures a good deal for you and avoids the risk of her backing out or the price going up in later rounds."
