Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, maximizing profit means trying to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still offers him a potential ""deal"" while leaving you a profit margin.
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially allowing you to still beat John's offer."
