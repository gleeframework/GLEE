"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, which I know is of great value to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits to your business. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,000,000. How about we meet at $920,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $950,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product to you while also ensuring a fair deal for me. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $930,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product at this price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value to me.",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards an agreement.  I understand your perspective, but $930,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $940,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product for you while also ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident that it will be a great value for my business.",915000.0,Bob,8,
