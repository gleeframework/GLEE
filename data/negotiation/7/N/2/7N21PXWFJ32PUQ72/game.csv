"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind closer to  $7,000. Would that be workable for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $7,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $7,750? That's a reasonable compromise in my mind.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $9,000? This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
