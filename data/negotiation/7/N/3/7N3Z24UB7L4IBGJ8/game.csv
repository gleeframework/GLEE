"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,000 is a bit high for me. How about $9,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
