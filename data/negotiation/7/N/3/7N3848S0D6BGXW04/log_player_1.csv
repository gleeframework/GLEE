Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I haven't accepted John's offer yet because there's potential to get a better deal from Bob.
* **Positivity and Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to frame the negotiation positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my absolute minimum ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** I can use John's offer as leverage. Bob knows I have another buyer, which might push him closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,125,000.  It's a win-win that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not all the way to Bob's price. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even at a higher number. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning John indirectly (""win-win""), I subtly remind Bob that I have other options, potentially encouraging him to make a more competitive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Could we meet halfway at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000). It's a good deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my price, showing he's serious. Accepting this offer demonstrates good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Bob might lower his offer, or I might miss out on a good deal by pushing too hard.  

This offer represents a favorable balance between profit and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
