"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I'm confident it's worth more than $100 to you. Let's start our negotiation. How about we aim for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I would like to propose an alternative. Given the value of our product, I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of the product without exceeding your budget.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I can afford. Given my budget, $110 is the absolute most I can do. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your financial situation and am willing to consider it.
