"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and gives me room to negotiate downwards. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm going to reject it for now.  I believe I can get a better price by countering."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for cheap."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I want to see if I can push him higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer that's still higher than my minimum, but lower than my previous offer. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to see if I can get Bob to budge."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm going to accept John's offer to ensure I get a price that's above my minimum."
