"Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $160 to make a deal. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  I understand your budget constraints, but I can't sell this product for less than $120. That's already a significant discount. Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
