"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm running out of time, so I hope we can reach an agreement quickly.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'll go down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
