Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's important to keep the negotiation going.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to considering selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm running out of time, so I hope we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'll go down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still too low for me, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations. It's getting close to my deadline, and I'm running out of time. To secure a good profit and ensure I don't lose out, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
