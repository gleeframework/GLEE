Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's maximum, creating a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $100,000 gap leaves space for counteroffers and potential compromise.
* **Attractive Offer:** $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, giving him a $100,000 profit potential. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I can always lower the price if needed, but starting high allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 backup offer gives me confidence to negotiate firmly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1050000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the luxury of rejecting Bob's offer without immediate financial risk.
* **Counteroffering:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  My counteroffer is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000, while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $1,150,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Staying flexible:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but this counteroffer establishes a more favorable starting point.
* **Maintaining the safety net:**  John's offer ensures I have a secure fallback option if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
