Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the message implies I'm open to discussion if Bob pushes back.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $11,000 is a $3,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob for maximum profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and the backup option of selling to John."
