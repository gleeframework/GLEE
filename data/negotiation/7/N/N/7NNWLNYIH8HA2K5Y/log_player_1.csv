Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique features and value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think you'll find this to be a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""unique features and value,""  you're aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to your asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it opens the door for counteroffers and a potential compromise that still benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price from Bob. Accepting $15,000 at this stage might leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a leap from your proposed $15,000.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** Show a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price, but not drastically. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and potentially nudge Bob towards a decision. 
* **Justification:** Reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point, even with the reduction.

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  You're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and John's offer.
2. **Maintain Control:**  The ""final offer"" statement puts the decision pressure on Bob.
3. **Set a Walk-Away Point:** If Bob doesn't budge, you're prepared to accept John's offer, ensuring you get your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $16,000 is a solid profit above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing negotiations could lead to Bob lowering his offer further, or even walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the time spent negotiating further could be better used elsewhere.  

Accepting Bob's offer at $16,000 balances profit maximization with negotiation efficiency."
