Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit. 

I'm eager to see what Bob's counteroffer will be, as it will give me a better understanding of how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's not enough to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me.  I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had two rounds of negotiation with him and he's still unwilling to come up on price.  I'm not confident that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  It's time to move on.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000 and secure a guaranteed sale."
