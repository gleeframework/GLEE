# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his desired price. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his $1,000,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is closer, but I need a bit more to make this work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let me know your decision.

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at $1,000,000, saving him $250,000."
