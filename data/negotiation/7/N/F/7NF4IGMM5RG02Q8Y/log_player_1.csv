I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to him. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I don't sell it for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
