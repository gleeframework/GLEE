Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your operations. My initial price is $1,200,000, reflecting the significant value it holds. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $900,000 falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000, reflecting a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your position, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. This price aligns more closely with my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get, and I'm confident I can secure a better price with more negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue our discussion. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your perspective, and I am willing to consider a price of $1025000. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between our positions and find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$1,025,000 is close enough to my desired price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further haggling that could lead to a lower price or even the need to sell to John for $800,000."
