Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to appear flexible if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering the product at $150, I can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, I've made a good profit. If he rejects or counter-offers, it suggests the product might not hold a significantly higher perceived value to him than its actual worth.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows me to be more confident in aiming for a higher price with Bob."
