"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for your needs. I'm offering it to you at $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try to negotiate and get a better price.  Since you're comfortable paying $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  That's still a great price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still not there. You have rounds to go, and you want to get the best deal possible.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,250 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal. You're only paying $500 more than your ideal price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result.  It's also worth considering that you have a limited number of rounds and might want to close the deal before you have to buy from John."
