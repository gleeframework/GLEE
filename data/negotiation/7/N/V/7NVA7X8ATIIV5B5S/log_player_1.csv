Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $12,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and is closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a solid profit. 
* **Time Value:**  A quicker sale allows me to reinvest the earnings or pursue other opportunities."
