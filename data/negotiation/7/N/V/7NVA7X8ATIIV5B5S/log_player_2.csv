"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial offer is way too high.  We have plenty of room to haggle and get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's important to start low to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're now getting closer to the heart of the negotiation.  We've jumped up our offer significantly, but it's still within our maximum budget. Let's see how Alice responds."
