"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's:**  $11,250 is still better than $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the likelihood of Alice going lower is unclear. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  The potential savings of a few hundred dollars are outweighed by the risk of paying more to John or losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most sensible option for Bob, maximizing his savings while securing the product."
