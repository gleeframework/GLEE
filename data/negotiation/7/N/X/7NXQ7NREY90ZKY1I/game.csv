"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts on this initial offer?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm confident it will still bring a good return on my investment, and I'd like to move forward with the purchase at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite agree to that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $980,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can agree on this price and move forward with the purchase.",960000.0,Bob,6,
