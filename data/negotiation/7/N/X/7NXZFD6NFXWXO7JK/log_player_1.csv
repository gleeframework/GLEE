Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:**  My message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 

By offering a high initial price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I still have the safety net of selling to John at my desired price."
