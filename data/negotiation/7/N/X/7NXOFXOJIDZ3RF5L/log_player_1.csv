"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. This will give me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also sets a strong baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price or if I should just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This way, I'm not losing money on the deal, and it still leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, guaranteeing the $15,000 sale with John is the best option at this point."
