"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While this is a good deal compared to John's price, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price right away. He's trying to reach a price that's both fair for him and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't immediately willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's make this happen.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and significantly better than John's price of $15,000.  While there's still some room for negotiation, it's unlikely Alice will drop much further.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
