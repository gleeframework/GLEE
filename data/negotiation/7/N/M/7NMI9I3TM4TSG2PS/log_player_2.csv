"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price in the subsequent rounds.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. It signals my willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm lower boundary.  By offering $1,300,000, I'm aiming for a price that's reasonable for both of us, leaving room for further compromise in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my preferred price. I'm not in a rush to buy and have the option to purchase from John for a lower price. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice, so I'll reject the offer and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. My counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a compromise, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still seeking a better deal. This price point is closer to her last offer, creating a more favorable negotiation space. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to my budget and only $20,000 above John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate outweighs the potential gains of a $20,000 discount. It's time to secure the deal at a price that's within my budget."
