Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his valuation and your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. You started high, and it's unlikely Bob would immediately accept your initial offer. By rejecting and countering, you can try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. However,  $150 is my asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by coming down from your initial offer. 
* **Midpoint:**  Offering a price directly in the middle between your first offer and his counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate reasonably.
* **Maintaining Profit:** You're still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($100), maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. While I appreciate the adjustment, I am still unable to meet at $125. I am willing to go up to $100 for this product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob has now countered twice with the same price, $100, which is his stated maximum. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Matching Your Minimum:** Accepting his offer meets your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't make a loss. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:** Further haggling might frustrate Bob, leading him to walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting now guarantees the sale."
