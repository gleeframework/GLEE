Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. He might not be willing to pay $18,000 but could be persuaded to meet somewhere in the middle."
