**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 threshold I need. At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward. I can secure a guaranteed $15,000 by selling to John and avoid further back-and-forth."
