"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value, I propose a starting price of $8500. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $8,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, but I'm confident it's fair considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value and potential benefits of our product, I propose a price of $8000. I believe this strikes a balance between what we both consider fair. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,000 is at Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will increase the price again or reject any further counteroffers. Accepting the offer at $8,000 ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
