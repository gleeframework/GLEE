"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from where I'd need to be. How about $10,500?  That's a fair offer that considers both our positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $10,500 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a bit more.  $11,500 is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're eager to make a deal, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can shake hands and make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
