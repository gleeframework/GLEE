Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $12,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're eager to make a deal, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can shake hands and make a deal.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $14,000, and at this point, the $1,000 difference isn't worth the risk of her going up in further rounds. John's offer is your safety net, and it's better to secure a reasonable price now."
