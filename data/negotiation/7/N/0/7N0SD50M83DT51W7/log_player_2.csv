"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you, and Alice's offer is higher than that. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice, even if you ultimately end up buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's a starting point for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down from her initial price and is now offering $1,300,000. This is closer to your maximum value of $1,200,000, but still leaves some room for saving money. However, it's risky to reject this offer and potentially end up paying even more after further negotiation or having to buy from John. 

Accepting the offer gives you the product at a price that is relatively favorable."
