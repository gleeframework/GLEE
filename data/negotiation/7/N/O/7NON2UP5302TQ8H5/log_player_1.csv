Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing me a healthy profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  It's better than nothing, but I'm not desperate to sell. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm starting to run out of time, I still haven't hit my minimum threshold for this product. I'm going to risk it and see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both show flexibility. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a great deal for me, especially considering how many rounds have passed. Bob is now offering my minimum threshold price. I'll accept the deal and get this done."
