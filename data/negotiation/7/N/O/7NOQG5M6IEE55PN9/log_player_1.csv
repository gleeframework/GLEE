{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to lower the price if necessary, while still exceeding your $15,000 minimum. 
* **It's a clear and direct offer:**  This establishes the starting point for negotiations.

By starting with this offer, you are demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.  You can then adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's tempting to take the $10,000, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **You have a backup option:** You can still sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal for you.
* **Room for negotiation:** You can counter-offer Bob with a price closer to your desired $12,000, which is still within his potential range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your negotiating position and keep the possibility of a better deal with Bob or a guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do at this time.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous $12,000 offer and Bob's $10,000 offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Setting a firm limit:**  While willing to compromise, $11,000 is still your firm lower limit.

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests. You're giving Bob a chance to accept a price closer to your desired range, but you're also prepared to walk away if he doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I've considered my budget and I'm unable to meet you halfway at $11,000. However, I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is the best option:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your desired price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, putting your potential sale at risk.

Selling to John offers the most secure and profitable outcome, guaranteeing you your desired earnings without further risk or delay."
