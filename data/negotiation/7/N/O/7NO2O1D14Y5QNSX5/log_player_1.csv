"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I'm providing a justification for the price to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, but the price is still high enough to ensure I profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he counteroffers, I'll evaluate if his offer is acceptable.
* **John's Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always go to John and secure the $1,500,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to ensure a profit. 
* **Exploring further:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Monitoring John's option:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement and making the deal happen.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **John's Option:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's an improvement, it's not enough for me to accept. 
* **Negotiation is important:**  I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, so I'm not ready to give up yet. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I'm confident that by continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's exactly in the middle between my last offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's offer ($1,350,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Encouraging closing the deal:**  I'm emphasizing the importance of finalizing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response carefully.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one) or make another counteroffer.
* **John's Option:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob break down, I'll sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.

* **Room for improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If we can't agree on a price, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price just slightly higher than his offer.
* **Continue to monitor John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,425,000. This is a small compromise that allows us to find common ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,425,000.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,410,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it's a fair price considering we are both close to agreeing.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,410,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,410,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** Bob's offer of $1,410,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, it's still $90,000 below that amount.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I'll choose to sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid further potentially unproductive negotiations with Bob."
