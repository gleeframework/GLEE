"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget. Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,425,000.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,410,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it's a fair price considering we are both close to agreeing.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1410000.0,Bob,8,
