"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a bit out of my budget. Would you be open to $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $9,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 again, but this time I'm not budging. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
