Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested but if not, I'm ready to counter his offer or go with John's $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer is my minimum. It's better to accept his offer than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
