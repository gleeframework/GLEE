"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,500.  I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
