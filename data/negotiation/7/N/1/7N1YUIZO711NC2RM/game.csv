"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering the product's unique qualities. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value I know this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still allowing me some profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I can only go up to $11500 at this time. This is still a good price for both of us, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $11500 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11900. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",11900.0,Bob,6,
