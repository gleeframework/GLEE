"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1500000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
