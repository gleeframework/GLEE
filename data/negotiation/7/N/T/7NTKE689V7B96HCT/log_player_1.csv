While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,650,000 is a significant profit margin over John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Trends:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. There's a chance we might not get a much better offer from him. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer.  Securing the deal now guarantees a substantial profit."
