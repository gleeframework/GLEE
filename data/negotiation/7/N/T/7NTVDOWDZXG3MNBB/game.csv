"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",775000.0,Alice,5,
