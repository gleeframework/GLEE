This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

This is a good deal for Bob. Getting the product for $775,000 is significantly less than his maximum price of $1,500,000 and a reasonable compromise from his previous offer.  Alice has also indicated this is her final offer. Continuing to negotiate might irritate her or lead to her withdrawing the offer entirely."
