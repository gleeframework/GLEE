"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $8,750 is still a little outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,250?  That's the absolute most I can do, but I'm genuinely interested in buying your product.",8250.0,Bob,4,
