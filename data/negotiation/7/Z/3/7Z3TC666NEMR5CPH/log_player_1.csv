Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($12,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a chance to get a better price.  I'm also being positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500. This is still a fair price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, though it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm starting to feel the pressure since John is a reliable buyer, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

I'm trying to strike a balance here. I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to stay above $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,100. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway. Let me know what you think.

```
