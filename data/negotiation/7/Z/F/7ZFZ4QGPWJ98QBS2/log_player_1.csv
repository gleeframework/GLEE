Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $12,000, I create space for Bob to counteroffer. This allows for a more natural negotiation process and makes it more likely that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. If he refuses $12,000, I can consider his counteroffer knowing I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below the $12,000 I initially offered.  Accepting this would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a compromise.  There's still a gap between what Bob is willing to pay and what I'm willing to accept, making further negotiation worthwhile.
* **The ""John"" safety net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation falls through. This gives me the confidence to push for a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good price and me a fair deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  Instead of a drastic counteroffer, I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  The $10,500 offer represents a middle ground between our two previous proposals. This signals a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely for Bob to consider it.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights that this price is a ""good price"" for Bob and a ""fair deal"" for me. This emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm still ready to counteroffer again if necessary, but this offer provides a solid starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price than $9,000, it's still significantly below what I want.  Selling at that price would result in a substantial loss.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000.  This provides me with a safety net, allowing me to be more firm in my negotiation with Bob. 
* **Room for another counteroffer:**  Bob's offer indicates that there's still a possibility of finding a middle ground. I can make a final counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price, hoping to close the deal.

**My next counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with $10,000. It's a compromise, but it's closer to what I want and still gives Bob a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. While I value our negotiation, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm reducing my price by $500 from the previous offer, indicating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fair Value:** $10,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and much closer to my ideal price. It's a compromise that balances my need for a good profit with the likelihood of closing the deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes finality (""Let's finalize this deal""). This subtly pushes Bob to make a decision, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $15,000 makes me confident in sticking to this counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John and walk away from this negotiation."
