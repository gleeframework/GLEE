Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth significantly exceeds your initial valuation. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * I make a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Exclusivity:**  By emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm adding a subtle psychological nudge, suggesting the offer might not be available if he hesitates."
