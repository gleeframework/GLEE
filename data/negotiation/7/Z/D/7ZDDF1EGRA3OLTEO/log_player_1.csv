{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially agree. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:** By starting high, you leave room for you to concede a bit if necessary, without feeling like you're giving away too much.

Keep in mind, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you might need to lower the price, but remember to always stay above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

While $12,000 is above your minimum, it's still closer to your minimum than to Bob's perceived value. There's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
