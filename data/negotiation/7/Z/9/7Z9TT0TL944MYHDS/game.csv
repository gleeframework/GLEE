"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high for me.  I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our positions. I can go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering what I'm willing to pay for this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm open to finding a solution, but I have other interested buyers.  To be candid, if we can't agree on a price closer to $1,700,000, I might need to explore those other options. What would you say to a price of $1,600,000? That feels like a significant move on my part to demonstrate my commitment to making this work.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I'm disappointed we haven't been able to reach a more agreeable number.  To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer from another buyer for $1,500,000.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic. I'm willing to work with you one last time: if you can meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to accept the other offer. ",1400000.0,Alice,7,
