"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper from Alice, so there's no reason to buy from John immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer gives you room to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a good deal for you and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to try and negotiate a lower price before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and this counteroffer shows that you're willing to compromise. This price is still a good deal for you, but it's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the chances of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now lower than John's price, making it the best option available.  While further negotiation could potentially get the price down even lower, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and then needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
