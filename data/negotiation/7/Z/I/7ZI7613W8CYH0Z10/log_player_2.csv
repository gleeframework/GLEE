Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,200. This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $13,200. This is higher than our maximum budget, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice when we have a better deal readily available."
