"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a little too high for me. Could you do any better on the price? I'm thinking something closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $1,220,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,220,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $1,160,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1160000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility on the price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay close to my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm offering you a revised price of $1,200,000, which is still a compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
