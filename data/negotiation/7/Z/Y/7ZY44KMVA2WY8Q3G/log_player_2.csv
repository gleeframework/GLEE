"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $1,220,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility on the price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay close to my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm offering you a revised price of $1,200,000, which is still a compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?

Alice has reached her minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better price, and buying from John would be more expensive."
