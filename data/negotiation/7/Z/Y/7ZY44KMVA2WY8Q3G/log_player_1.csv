Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a little too high for me. Could you do any better on the price? I'm thinking something closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
