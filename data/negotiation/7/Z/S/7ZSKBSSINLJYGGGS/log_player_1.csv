{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the value for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum goal of $12,000. If Bob rejects, I can still counter and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, I believe there's still potential for negotiation.  He's shown interest and is willing to counter, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **John as a fallback:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a subpar offer.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the fairness of the offer.
* **Positive framing:** I use phrases like ""fair deal"" to create a positive tone and encourage acceptance. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $8,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, but leaves space for further negotiation if necessary.  

**Overall:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring a smooth negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but I'd need to be around $7,500 to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer provides me with the flexibility to continue negotiating without feeling pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I might suggest a price between $8,000 and $8,500 to show continued flexibility and hopefully reach a deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To make this work for me, I'm willing to drop to $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing $8,250, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Finality:** I use phrases like ""make this work"" and ""close this deal"" to suggest this could be the final offer.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the ""fair price"" for both of us to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts some pressure on Bob to accept, as it's likely closer to his budget and further negotiation may risk losing the deal altogether.

**Overall:** This counteroffer aims to nudge the negotiation closer to my desired price point while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
