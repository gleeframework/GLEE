"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
