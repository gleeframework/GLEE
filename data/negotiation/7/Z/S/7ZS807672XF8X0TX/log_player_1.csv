"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,500 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and getting closer to my minimum of $10,000.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely."
