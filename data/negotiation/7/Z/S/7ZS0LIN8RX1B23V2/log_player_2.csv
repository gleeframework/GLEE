# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great addition to your collection. Let me know what you think!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $8,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident we can make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
