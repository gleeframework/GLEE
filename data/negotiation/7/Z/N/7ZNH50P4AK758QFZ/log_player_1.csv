Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) thanks to John's guaranteed offer.  This allows for ambitious negotiation.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, aiming higher allows room for potential profit above Bob's own perceived value.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable to Alice compared to a lower initial offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to create a narrative of value exceeding the asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  It's unknown how price-sensitive Bob is.  A very high offer might make him walk away without counter-offering.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. This might involve slight price reductions or highlighting additional benefits the product offers."
