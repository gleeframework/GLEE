"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time. I'm confident this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $12000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
