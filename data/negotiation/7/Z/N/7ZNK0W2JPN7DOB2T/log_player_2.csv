"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. I'm confident this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $10,000. He has a chance to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $12000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $13,500 is still above his budget.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it's a better decision to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation."
