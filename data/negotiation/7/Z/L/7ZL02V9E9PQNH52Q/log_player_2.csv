Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer starts at $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above John's price.  I'm aiming to create a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm confident that Alice will want to close the deal, and this offer gives her some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a substantial amount."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I'm aiming to meet her halfway. This should keep the negotiation moving while still allowing me to save a significant amount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm committed to saving as much as possible, and with 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth pushing for a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still too high. With 3 rounds left, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $925,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to move towards her price.  However, it's still significantly below her last offer, and with only two rounds left, the pressure is on her to accept a deal."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice, and her offer of $1,020,000 is still too high for my budget.  I've made several counteroffers, but it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. It's now more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $800,000 to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
