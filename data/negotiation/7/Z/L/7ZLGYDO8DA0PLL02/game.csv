"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't agree.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $12,000.",9250.0,Alice,5,
