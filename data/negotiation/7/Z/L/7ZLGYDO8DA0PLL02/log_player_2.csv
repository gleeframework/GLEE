"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,250 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure the product for $8,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
