"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
