Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $100.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** There's room for negotiation and Bob might be willing to pay more. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the conversation going.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100 for this product. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum, it's also your fallback option with John.  I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob before settling.  

I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about $105? That's still a good value for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm still trying to maximize my profits, but acknowledging Bob's budget and offering a small concession shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see how he responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, I am still looking to keep the price at or below $100. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John. While Bob is willing to negotiate, he's clearly not going to budge above $100. I've already made a counteroffer and it seems like we're at an impasse.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm comfortable with the $100 price."
