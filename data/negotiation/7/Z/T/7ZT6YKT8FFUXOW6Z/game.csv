"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
