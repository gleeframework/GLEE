You can definitely do better than $1,100,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.

You're still paying more than you'd like to with Alice's latest offer.  See if you can push her down a bit further, but be prepared to buy from John if it doesn't work out."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to that price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.

Alice has come down some, but she's still above your absolute limit. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You'll save $25,000 by doing so."
