"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $140, which is a good middle ground. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $130. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I can meet you in the middle. How about $137.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can meet you at $137.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you consider that?,125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I can do $128, that's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'll go as low as $135, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think we're at a standstill. I'm going to take my chances with John, who is willing to buy the product for $120. Good luck with your shopping, Bob!",135.0,Alice,9,
