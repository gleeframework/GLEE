"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $85? I think that's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit.",85.0,Alice,5,
