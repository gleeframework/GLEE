"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($1,100,000) by going to John ($1,200,000). However, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price, and you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You have some room to move downward, and a counteroffer is still your best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,150,000 and you are aiming to pay less than $1,200,000 for the product. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and gives Alice a chance to negotiate while still putting you in a good position to save money."
