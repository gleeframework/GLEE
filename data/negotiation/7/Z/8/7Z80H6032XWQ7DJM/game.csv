"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get great value for your money.",8500.0,Alice,3,
