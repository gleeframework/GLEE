Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still potentially appealing to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** This approach sets the stage for a negotiation, allowing me to see Bob's interest and gauge his potential counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, but we need to work towards a price that's more favorable for me. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  While I want to maximize my earnings, I know I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground, acknowledging Bob's interest while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value & Flexibility:**  I emphasize the value of the product and show flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $17,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and easy to understand, making it clear what my counter-offer is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has already gone through several rounds, and continuing might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for a lower price.

While I'd prefer to earn more,  $14,000 is a reasonable outcome considering my minimum and the possibility of further negotiation."
