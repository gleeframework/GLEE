Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation without immediately shutting Bob down.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the message to highlight the product's benefits and potential value for Bob. This could increase his willingness to pay more.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation moving. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's counter-offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is too low, there's still potential to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for a higher price, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll consider factors like Bob's potential to negotiate further and my overall willingness to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum price. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but still protects my interests.
* **Value Emphasis:** I again highlight the value of the product to make a higher price more palatable.
* **Open-Ended:** The message remains open-ended, inviting further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a sale at a reasonable price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's potential for further negotiation and consider whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even my previous counteroffer of $11,000. 
* **Bob's ultimatum:** Bob has made it clear that this is his final offer and he's willing to walk away. This significantly reduces the chance of him budging in future negotiations.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. This is a far better outcome than accepting Bob's offer or continuing to negotiate with him.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I'll immediately sell the product to John to secure the best possible price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when a better option is readily available."
