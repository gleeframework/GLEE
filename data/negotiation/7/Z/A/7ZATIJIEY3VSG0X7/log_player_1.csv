"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, just under Bob's perceived value, to see if I can get a quick deal.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate.  He's clearly willing to pay more than John, and I believe I can still push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,090,000. This is a compromise, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I'm hopeful he'll accept this offer.  If not, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy for the remaining rounds."
