{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while also demonstrating a commitment to acquiring the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price.  Bob can also use this rejection to gauge Alice's flexibility."

{""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and is only $40,000 higher than his last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John. Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is within Bob's limit and is a good compromise."
