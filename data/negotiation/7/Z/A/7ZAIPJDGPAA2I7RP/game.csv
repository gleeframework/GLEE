"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",999000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $925000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $880000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $880000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to make a new offer of $915000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $880000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay more. I'd like to reiterate that offer and see if we can come to an agreement at that price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
