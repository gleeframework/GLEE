"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum budget, it's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to sell for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's 16.6% lower than Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point. It shows that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate. This gives Alice some room to counter without feeling pressured to immediately accept your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $140 is still within your budget. Accepting the offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John and avoids further negotiation rounds."
