Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to aim for that.  We want to maximize our profit.
* **Below John's Offer:** We know we have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.  Therefore, any price Bob accepts between $150 and $175 is profitable for us.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might outright reject $175. However, it's a starting point. If he rejects, we can always send a follow-up offer closer to $150 before going to John."
