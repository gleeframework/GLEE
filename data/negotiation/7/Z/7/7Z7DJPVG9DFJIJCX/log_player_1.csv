Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $120 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Potential Loss Aversion:**  Bob might be more inclined to buy at a higher price if he thinks he might miss out on a good deal by waiting. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation tactics, other approaches might be more effective."
