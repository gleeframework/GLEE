"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing negotiations. I'm willing to make one final offer: $820000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,
