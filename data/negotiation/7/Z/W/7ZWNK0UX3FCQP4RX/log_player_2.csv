Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see that we're making progress. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $8,000 for the product if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought it over, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is my last offer, as I really need to consider the other buyer who is willing to pay $8,000. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to them. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $11,000 gets you the product for significantly less than John's $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice to the other buyer."
