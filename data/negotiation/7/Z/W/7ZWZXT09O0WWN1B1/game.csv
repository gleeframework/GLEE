"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While $600,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $600,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $600,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $620,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price and I'm willing to move forward with the deal.",620000.0,Alice,5,
