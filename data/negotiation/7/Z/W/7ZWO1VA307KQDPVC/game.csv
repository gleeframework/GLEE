"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a valuable product at a lower price than my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  I'm confident this price works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. To make this work for me, I need to be at $950,000.  This is a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Think of it as a final offer from my side. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
