You should reject Alice's offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price, as you're willing to pay $10,000, and you have the option to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,800?  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you given the product's potential.

While $10,800 is closer to your limit, it's still a bit more than you're willing to pay. You can always go with John, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the better strategy."
