"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, however, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted. I could do  $1,125,000."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price can help you understand her negotiating flexibility and leave more room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and professional tone is important for a positive negotiation, even while being firm on price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to bring Alice closer to your desired price range while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budgetary concerns, but I believe $1,125,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her price is still above both your budget and John's offer.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but  $1,875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value while staying within my budget."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** This counter-offer shows Alice you are willing to move towards her price, but at a measured pace. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating your budget limitations and emphasizing fairness, you are reinforcing your position.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still below your maximum budget and creates room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a final price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to find a number that works for both of us. However, $1,350,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,650,000.  This offer is firm, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still $150,000 above John's offer. Since your goal is to save money and John is offering the product at a lower price, it's more beneficial to buy from John at this point."
