"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, however, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted. I could do  $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budgetary concerns, but I believe $1,125,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but  $1,875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value while staying within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to find a number that works for both of us. However, $1,350,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,650,000.  This offer is firm, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you're receiving.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
