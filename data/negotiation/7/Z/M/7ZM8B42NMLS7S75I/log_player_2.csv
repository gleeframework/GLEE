"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He has a clear maximum price of $1,000,000 and Alice wants to sell for more. There's room for negotiation to find a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $1,300,000 is closer to his maximum, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
