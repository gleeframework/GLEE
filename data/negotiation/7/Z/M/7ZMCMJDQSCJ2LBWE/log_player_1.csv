Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** By starting at $110, I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible. It's also likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** Using a friendly tone might encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $110 is not my absolute bottom line. This leaves room for me to compromise if necessary. 
* **Knowing my exit strategy:** I'm aware of John's offer of $100, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, while accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I've lowered my price to $105, indicating a willingness to negotiate and showing good faith.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue the conversation.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize that the offer is still a ""great deal"" for him, reminding him of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still doesn't quite meet it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I'm concerned that if I reject Bob's offer, he might get more stubborn or walk away, leaving me with no deal.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is the most I can be sure of at this point.

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of John's offer, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100."
