"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You have a significant buffer between your maximum value ($1,000,000) and Alice's minimum value ($800,000), which gives you room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, well above your minimum acceptable price, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for you and minimizes the risk of losing out on the product."
