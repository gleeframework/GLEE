"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $11,000 is too low for me. I can get at least $12,000 from John, so I'm not willing to sell for less than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,750? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,750 is closer to what I want, I can still get $12,000 from John, so I'm not willing to settle for less.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,750 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground this time."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to walking away. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,900? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close to my minimum price. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low. I can't afford to keep negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's still a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
