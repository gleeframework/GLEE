"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. Can you consider that?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,900 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $11,050. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. What do you say?",11050.0,Alice,5,
