"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing that you're a serious buyer. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it's the best I can do.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to go up to $725,000, and that's my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",725000.0,Bob,6,
