"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I think the product's value is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $850,000, which is still above your original offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
