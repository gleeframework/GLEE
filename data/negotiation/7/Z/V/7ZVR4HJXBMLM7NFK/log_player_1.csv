Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" subtly implies you believe it's worth more than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but comes with the slight risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup buyer, you're not losing out completely if Bob declines."
