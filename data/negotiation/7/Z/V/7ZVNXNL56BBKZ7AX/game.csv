"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,400. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",13400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $13,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13200.0,Bob,6,
