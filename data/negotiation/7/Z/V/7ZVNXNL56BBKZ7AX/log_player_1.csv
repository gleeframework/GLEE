{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher price could immediately deter Bob and lead to a quick rejection.
* **It includes a friendly message:**  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000, so I have some flexibility to make counteroffers if Bob is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'd like to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a good middle ground:

* **It shows flexibility:** I'm willing to budge from my previous price, demonstrating my interest in a deal.
* **It's not a huge jump:**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's offer, making it seem reasonable.
* **It includes a positive message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget and offer a ""compromise,"" promoting a sense of fairness.

This should hopefully keep the negotiation going and get us closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not quite ready to sell yet. I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,400. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

Here's why I'm counteroffering again:

* **It shows commitment:**  I'm not giving up easily and demonstrating my interest in making a deal.
* **It's a small but meaningful adjustment:**  $13,400 is a small increase from Bob's last offer, making it seem achievable.
* **It emphasizes fairness:**  I again frame the offer as a compromise, making it more appealing.

With this counteroffer, I'm hoping to secure a price that's closer to my minimum while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $13,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell to John for $15,000. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiation is getting difficult:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but seems stuck at his maximum.  
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation might take a long time and could result in a lower price.
* **John offers a secure deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $15,000, securing a sale with John is the best option at this point."
