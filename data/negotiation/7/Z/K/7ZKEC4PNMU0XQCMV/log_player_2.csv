{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $50, which is half of Alice's initial price. This should give us some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll reject it and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to $75, showing I'm serious about buying but still keeping it below my limit.  This should hopefully start getting us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. While I could accept this offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject and try one more counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $90, hoping this is close enough to entice Alice to accept. This is my final counteroffer, and if she rejects, I'll move on to John."
