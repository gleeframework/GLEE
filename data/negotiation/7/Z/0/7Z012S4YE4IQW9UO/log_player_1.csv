Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000, which is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating,  it's getting close to John's offer of $1,500,000. To avoid risking a further decline in the price, I'll choose to sell to John."
