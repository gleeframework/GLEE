{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity for you to gain [briefly highlight a key benefit Bob would get from the product]. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. My offer price is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,400,000 is a starting point that leaves some room for negotiation but is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights a potential benefit for Bob. It aims to build rapport and show that you're open to negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * Secure a higher price than Bob's initial assessment.
    * Leave room for potential counteroffers without risking a deal with John.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adapt your negotiation strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately above my budget.  Considering the value I'm looking to get from this product, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. While selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob. There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to send Bob a counteroffer in the next round. Consider a counteroffer that is closer to your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It's important to be firm but also show flexibility to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This would still allow me to achieve my goals, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** $1,100,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than your minimum value. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position, expresses your willingness to compromise, and highlights the value of the product. This helps to maintain a positive tone during the negotiation.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * Show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
    * Stay above your minimum acceptable price.
    * Encourage further negotiation with Bob, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable deal.

Remember, the key is to find a price that works for both of you. Be prepared to adjust your counteroffer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it's a significant step closer to your desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to your minimum value, it's still significantly lower. Selling to John would guarantee you a much higher profit, but it's worth exploring one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer in the next round. Consider a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum value. You can also emphasize the value proposition of the product and highlight the benefits Bob would gain by accepting your offer. Remember to maintain a positive and collaborative tone in your communication."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is still below my target, I recognize the value this product brings to you and want to find a solution that works for both of us. To move forward, I'm offering a price of $1,050,000.  This represents a substantial compromise from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** $1,050,000 is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It represents a significant step closer to Bob's price, while still allowing you to achieve a profit above your minimum value.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position, reiterates your willingness to negotiate, and emphasizes the value proposition of the product. It also highlights the compromise you're making, demonstrating your commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * Show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I truly appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still limited by my budget. I'm prepared to offer $975000.  This price represents a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the significant progress we've made.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly below your minimum value of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's clear that a mutually agreeable price is unlikely to be reached.  

Given the situation, selling the product to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a much higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. While it's always good to try to maximize profit,  sometimes it's more advantageous to secure a guaranteed deal than to risk getting a lower price."
