{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Room to Compromise:** It's lower than my minimum value, so I have space to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic first offer.  The actual negotiation will depend on Bob's response and how the conversation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is less than my minimum price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind his budget limitations and my minimum price. I'll aim for a price that is reasonable for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my price range."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Toward Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By offering $9,500, I'm leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I will need to decide whether to make another counteroffer,  accept his offer (at a lower price), or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000.  While I would prefer more, this is a reasonable outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's always a chance that I could counteroffer and get a slightly higher price, but there's also a chance that Bob could walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's still profitable.
* **No Further Upside:**  I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher offer from Bob, and selling to John would only get me $3,000 more.  The potential gain is not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely.

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally want more, accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is the most logical choice in this situation. It minimizes risk and secures a sale that's still profitable."
