"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's my maximum budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my price range.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
