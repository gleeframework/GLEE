Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to the table.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,500, and I'm unwilling to pay more than $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
