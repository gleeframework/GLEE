"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to the table.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
