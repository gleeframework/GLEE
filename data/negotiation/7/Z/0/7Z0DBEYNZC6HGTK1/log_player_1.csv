Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start with a price closer to our minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives the product's value differently.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, there's a chance to settle on a price higher than $80.
* **Backup Plan:** It's important to remember that we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This knowledge allows us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob, as we don't risk losing the sale entirely."
