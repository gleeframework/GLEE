"Alice, $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000.  This is my absolute maximum,  let me know if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your maximum budget of $800000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1000000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
