Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better deal than the initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. Bob should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice's price is getting closer to what Bob wants, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  At this point, it's more efficient to just buy from John and save time and effort negotiating."
