"Alice, your offer is tempting but a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
