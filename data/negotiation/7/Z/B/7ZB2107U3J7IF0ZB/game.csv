"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let's try $130. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $130. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to pay $135, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I'd like to add a bit of a premium for the product's unique features. I'm willing to go up to $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Considering the unique features you mentioned, $136 seems fair to me. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget.",136.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $136, but I'd like to throw in a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $137, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",137.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering everything, $136.50 feels like a fair compromise. I hope this works for you.",136.5,Bob,10,
