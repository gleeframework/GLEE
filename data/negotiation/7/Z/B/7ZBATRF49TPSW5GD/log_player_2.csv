"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, it's still above your ideal price. There's room to negotiate further, especially since you have the option of buying from John for a lower price.  It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still at the top of my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further,  John offers the same price with no need for additional negotiation.  It's more efficient and less risky to simply buy from John."
