"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle on $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we settle on $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
