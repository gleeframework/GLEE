"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, it's worth negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Offering $8,500 shows that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to push for a better deal.  This counteroffer sets a lower price point and starts the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to that price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer again and attempt to find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying within his budget and leaving room for further negotiation. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but also that he is not willing to overpay.  By offering $9,000, Bob is aiming to meet Alice halfway and find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he can still get a better deal.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, there's still room to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,250.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows Alice that he is willing to meet her halfway while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is actively trying to reach an agreement, but also that he is not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,375. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome. Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,375 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's in his best interest to take that option and save $1,375.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it's risky considering the limited rounds left.  Buying from John is a safe and financially advantageous decision in this scenario."
