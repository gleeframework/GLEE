"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to close a deal, $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,250.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal.
