"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true potential and benefits this product offers.  How about we meet halfway and settle for $1,450,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However,  $1,450,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? This is a substantial discount from my original offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a big step for me, and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,000,000? This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
