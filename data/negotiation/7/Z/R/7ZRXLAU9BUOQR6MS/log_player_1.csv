Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,050,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
