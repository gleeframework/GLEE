Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a high price for me with a potential for Bob to accept. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also protects me from selling too low. If Bob rejects, I can still counter-offer and potentially get closer to my goal.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'll be mindful of that during the negotiation."
