"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not convinced that's enough.

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, so I'm counteroffering at $1225000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1200000, and you've made it clear that you're not willing to meet that price. I'm going to take a break from negotiating with you and explore other opportunities. However, I'm leaving the door open for you to reconsider and make a serious offer. If you're willing to meet me at $1200000, I'm willing to revisit the conversation.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
