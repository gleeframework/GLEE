Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a very competitive price of $1,199,999. I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident you'll find this offer highly attractive."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I don't want to go lower.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it slightly below $1,200,000 might entice him while still exceeding his perceived value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message hints at the product's desirability and  implies it's a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but it's a calculated one. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's perspective."
