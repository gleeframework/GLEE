"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering both our interests. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I understand the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but it's significantly more valuable to me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement quickly.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price respects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a little low for me.  Given the value this product holds for both of us, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that respects our respective needs. I'm confident you'll find this to be a good investment. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
