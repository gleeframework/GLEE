"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
