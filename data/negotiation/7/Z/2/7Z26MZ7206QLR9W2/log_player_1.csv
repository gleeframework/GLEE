Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
