{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, Alice needs to aim for a price higher than that to maximize her profit with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for the full $1,000,000 or slightly more might be tempting, but it leaves Bob with little to no incentive to buy. A price closer to $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By starting at $950,000, Alice creates a sense of urgency and value while still leaving some room for potential negotiation. This price point makes Bob feel like he's getting a ""deal"" compared to John's offer, even though it's still very favorable for Alice."
