"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
