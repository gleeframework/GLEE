"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep. Can you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your offer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm feeling the pressure, I'm still not comfortable selling for $7,500. It's too far below my minimum. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible here. However, I can't go any lower than $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low, and I'm worried that further negotiation will only result in a lower price.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better price with Bob.  Therefore, it's better to sell to John now for $8,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
