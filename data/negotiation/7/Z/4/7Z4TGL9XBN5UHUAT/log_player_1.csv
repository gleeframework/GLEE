Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures you make a good profit.
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:** While $119 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), it might be acceptable if the product fulfills a specific need or desire, and Bob perceives it as a good deal compared to alternatives. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially maximize your profit before going with your guaranteed sale to John."
