``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, and it's below Bob's perceived value, making it appealing to him.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still below the price I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,120,000. This still leaves you a good margin of profit, considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,120,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,090,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is close enough to my desired price. While it's not ideal, it's a good deal and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob. It's definitely better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
