Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He can still make a significant profit ($200,000) if he accepts. 
* **It's a good deal for you:** You're getting a good chunk of the potential value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth where you can potentially push the price even higher.

Remember, you can always choose to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 just doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $950,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe this price still offers you a great return."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a serious offer of $920,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $920,000 is a good deal and within my acceptable range.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000 and it seems like Bob is serious about buying.  I'll take it!"
