Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, it's clear we are unlikely to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. I'm not willing to risk losing the opportunity to sell the product for a guaranteed $1,200,000 to John. Selling to John is the most secure option at this point."
