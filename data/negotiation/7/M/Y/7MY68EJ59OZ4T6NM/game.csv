"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $110.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable with $130.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
