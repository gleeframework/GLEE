"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers,  $7,000, and call it a deal?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
