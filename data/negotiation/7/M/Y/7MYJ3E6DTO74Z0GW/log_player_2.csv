# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget of $12,000. He should counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $12,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better price."
