"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make you a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize potential profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message also indicates that I'm open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's still plenty of time to get a better deal. 
* **Room for compromise:**  It's likely Bob is willing to pay more than $85, as he showed initial interest. I can use the next round to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not surrender:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired profit. 
* **Reiterate value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value and how he's still getting a good deal at $100.
* **Open to further discussion:** The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Time is valuable:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal. Further negotiations might not lead to a significantly higher price, and I risk losing Bob altogether. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him to another buyer. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a profit of $10, which is a good outcome considering my minimum profit goal."
