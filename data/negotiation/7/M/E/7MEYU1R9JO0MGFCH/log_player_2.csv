"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further negotiation."
