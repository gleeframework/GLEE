"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter.  How about we start at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway!  $135 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get it for $130. Would you be willing to go that low? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $132.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
