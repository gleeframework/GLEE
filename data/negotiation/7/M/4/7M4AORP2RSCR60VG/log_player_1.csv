{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below what I consider the product's value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also getting closer to selling to John if I don't see a more attractive offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'll lower my price to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If we don't agree on this, I'll have to move forward with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
