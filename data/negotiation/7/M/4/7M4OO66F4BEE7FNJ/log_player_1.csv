I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me with a profit significantly above my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to reach a deal that's fair to both of us."
