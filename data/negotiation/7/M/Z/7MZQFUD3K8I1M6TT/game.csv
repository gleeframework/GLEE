"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, but it's a bit more within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which still offers you a great deal while allowing me to achieve a fair return on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
