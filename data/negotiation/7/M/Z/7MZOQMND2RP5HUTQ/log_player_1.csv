Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is unfortunately way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 right now.  Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my target price of $10,000, I would like to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. However, I will also consider the option of selling the product to John for $10,000, but I'll wait for now and see if I can get a better offer from Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $8,500, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's higher than that, but still below my target price of $10,000. I'll offer a price that's 10% higher than Bob's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $8800. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.
