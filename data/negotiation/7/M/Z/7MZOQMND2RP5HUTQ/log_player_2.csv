"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a lower price that is still within Alice's potential profit margin. It also emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while clearly stating his budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $9250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $8800. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering a price closer to his limit but still within a reasonable range for Alice. The message emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, putting more pressure on Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $9320. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,320. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,320
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While there's a chance she might lower the price further, it's getting risky to continue the negotiation. With only 5 rounds left, Bob has a better chance of closing the deal with John, who is offering the product at a price that fits Bob's budget."
