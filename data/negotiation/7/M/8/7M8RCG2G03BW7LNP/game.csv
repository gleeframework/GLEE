"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $9000 was a compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I can offer you a slight discount for the sake of getting a deal done. I can do $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $9200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8900.  It's a fair price, considering your value for the product, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,6,
