"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $220. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for a great product.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose $180 as a fair price. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $200, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $190. I believe this is a reasonable price given the product's quality and features. Looking forward to your response.",190.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $190 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $210 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, Bob.",210.0,Alice,7,

"I see your point, Alice. I would like to counter with $205. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",205.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm not willing to go any lower than $220, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $220, I'm going to have to consider other options.",220.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your patience, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose $215 as the final price for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and allows us to close the deal.",215.0,Bob,10,
