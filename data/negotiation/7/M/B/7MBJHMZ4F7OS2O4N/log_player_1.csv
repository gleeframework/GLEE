Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and still reach a satisfactory outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, you'll get a better sense of how much he values the product. 
* **John as a Backdrop:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000 gives you a strong position. You're not desperate and can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $10,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is significantly below your minimum of $15,000 and closer to his own perceived value ($8,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to negotiate more confidently with Bob.
* ** Aiming Higher:**  It's worth trying to get closer to your minimum price. Bob's initial counteroffer doesn't necessarily mean he won't go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $20,000 is closer to the value this product brings. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm to your minimum acceptable price.  It's a common negotiation tactic to meet in the middle.
* **Clear Bottom Line:** By stating $15,000 as a potential meeting point, you're subtly signaling to Bob that this is likely your lowest acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have the option to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can do. How about $12,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to purchase if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob increased his offer, but $12,000 is still significantly below your $15,000 minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge the gap, and you risk losing the guaranteed offer from John.
* **John's Offer is Solid:**  Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
