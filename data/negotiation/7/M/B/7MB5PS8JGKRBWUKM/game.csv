"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
