"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $8,250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to come up to $8,750? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. I'd like to propose $8,500 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and $8,750, which would be $8,625. Can you consider that?",8625.0,Bob,6,
