"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a slightly lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
