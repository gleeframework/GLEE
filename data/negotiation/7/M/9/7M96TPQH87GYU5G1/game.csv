"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1500000. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $2000000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it could be extremely valuable to you. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum is $800000. Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This is still a substantial discount from my initial price and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1100000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1300000 to make this worthwhile. If you're serious about purchasing this product, I believe this is the best we can do. Let me know if you're willing to budge a little.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
