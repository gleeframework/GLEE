"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the significant benefit it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You still have room to negotiate down to your target price without needing to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price of $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with substantial value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $1,200,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better price. You have room to negotiate further without needing to buy from John."
