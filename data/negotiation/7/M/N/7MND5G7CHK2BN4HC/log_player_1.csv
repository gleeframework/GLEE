Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer easy to understand and remember.

I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000? This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value for your money.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer.  It's also significantly higher than his initial offer and above his perceived value for the product.  This is a good deal for me, and it's likely that any further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth. I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000."
