Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,120,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly very interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. Accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and there's a risk he might lower his offer in subsequent rounds."
