"Alice, your product looks great, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $13,500? It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can do $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's the lowest I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
