"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60 for the product?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you do $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is quite low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to sell for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're right, meeting in the middle seems fair. How about $110? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $80. If you can do $100, I'm ready to close the deal with you right now.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider that other option.",100.0,Bob,6,
