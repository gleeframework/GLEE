"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards while staying well within my $80 budget. 
* **Polite and Direct:** My message is polite to maintain a good negotiating environment but also makes it clear that $200 is unacceptable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is on price and inform my strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $130 is still significantly higher than my $80 budget.  I need to show her I'm serious about a lower price point. It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 is quite low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to sell for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It acknowledges Alice's need for a higher price while moving closer to my budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $90 is still a significant saving compared to Alice's offer of $130 and her previous $200. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the 10-round limit (and the option of John's guaranteed $80 price).  This offer keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, meeting in the middle seems fair. How about $110? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the need for a more balanced deal, but $110 is still above my target price. I'll keep negotiating, but I need to signal that I'm getting closer to taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $80. If you can do $100, I'm ready to close the deal with you right now.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider that other option."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition (John):** I'm subtly letting Alice know I have a strong alternative if she doesn't agree.  This increases the pressure to make a deal now.
* **Final Offer:** $100 is my last offer. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to close the deal right now,"" I'm encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Staying Respectful:** Even though I'm applying pressure, I'm maintaining a respectful tone to avoid derailing the negotiation."
