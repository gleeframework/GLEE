"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $125. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $155. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $147? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",147.0,Alice,5,
