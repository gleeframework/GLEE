"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. My counteroffer is $1,020,000. I'm hoping this is a price you can work with.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we split the difference and settle at $985,000?",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,015,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,020,000 and $985,000, which would be $1,002,500. I'm hoping this is a price that works for both of us.",1002500.0,Alice,7,
