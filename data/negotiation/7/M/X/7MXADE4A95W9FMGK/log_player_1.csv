"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price allows space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring a significant profit if accepted outright.
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to build rapport and emphasize the product's value to Bob, encouraging a positive response.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to adjust our approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We demonstrate that we believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upward:**  By rejecting this offer, we aim to steer Bob's subsequent counteroffers towards a more favorable price point. 

We are confident that we can negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds without risking the guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm confident it will bring substantial value to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are lowering our price by $50,000, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the reduction is calculated to keep the price well above both our minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message maintains a confident and assertive tone, signaling that we are firm in our valuation while still open to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong profit margin ($200,000 above our minimum) and is a significant portion of his perceived value. Accepting this offer is the most logical decision because:

* **Excellent Profit:**  Securing a $1,000,000 sale is a substantial gain, exceeding our minimum by a considerable margin.
* **Reduced Risk:** Accepting now eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds. While we might push for slightly more, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and we risk him lowering his offer or walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to re-invest or utilize the profit sooner rather than continuing negotiations.

While we could potentially push for a higher price, the current offer represents a fantastic balance of profit and minimal risk."
