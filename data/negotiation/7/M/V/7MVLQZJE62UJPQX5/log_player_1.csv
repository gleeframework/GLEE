"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $800,000. If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer but it's still not meeting my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, and  I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
