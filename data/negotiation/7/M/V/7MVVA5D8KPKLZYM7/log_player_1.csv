""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,199,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John guarantees $1,200,000, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially still reach a deal above $1,200,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $1,199,999 price point feels more appealing than a flat $1,200,000, potentially making Bob more amenable to the deal.

**Important Note:** While this offer aims to maximize Alice's potential profit, it's essential to remember that Bob has no obligation to accept.  He may reject the offer if he finds the price unreasonable."
