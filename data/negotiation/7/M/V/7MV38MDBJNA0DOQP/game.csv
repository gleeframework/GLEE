"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $90. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet somewhere in the middle?  I'm willing to pay $70.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product for $85. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
