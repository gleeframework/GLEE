Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $90. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product for $85. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $85, which is within our budget. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might not go any lower.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it and having to buy from John at $80."
