"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to accommodate them. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $90 for the product. This still reflects its value while being more accessible to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's the maximum I can afford, and it's still a fair price for a product with the value you're describing.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I see, Bob. Thank you for standing firm on your offer. Considering the ongoing dialogue and understanding your financial situation, I am prepared to offer the product at $87. This is the best I can do while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself.",87.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $87 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $86. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",86.0,Bob,6,
