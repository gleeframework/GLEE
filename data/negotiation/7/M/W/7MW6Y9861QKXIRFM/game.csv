"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $13000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11500. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $11000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
