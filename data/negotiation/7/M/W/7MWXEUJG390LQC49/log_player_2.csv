"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I'll make a counter-offer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's flexibility. This offer is closer to my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to my budget, but I know I can get it for $12,000 from John. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a little further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. $12,500 is closer, but I was hoping to land closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to my walk-away price ($12,000 from John) while still leaving some room for Alice to counter. This keeps the negotiation moving and signals that I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly and is now offering the product for $1,500 less than her initial offer.  While I could be stubborn and try to get it down to $11,000, there's a chance she won't budge and I'd end up buying from John anyway. Saving $1,500 is a good deal, and it's better to secure the product now rather than risk losing it."
