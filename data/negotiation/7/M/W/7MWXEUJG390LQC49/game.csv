"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. $12,500 is closer, but I was hoping to land closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
