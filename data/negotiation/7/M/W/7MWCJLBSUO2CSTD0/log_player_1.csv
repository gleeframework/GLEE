Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering a price just below John's guaranteed offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he rejects.
* **Negotiation Room:** The slightly inflated price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing within a profitable range for Alice."
