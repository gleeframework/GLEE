"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $125. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You are willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is a reasonable strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $110?  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $117?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved from $125 to $117, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* You're willing to pay up to $150, so $117 is still a good deal for you.
* While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
