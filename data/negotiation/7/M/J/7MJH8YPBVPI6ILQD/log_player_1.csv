```

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.**  I'm aiming for a higher profit.
* **There are still rounds left.**  I can try to negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John guarantees the minimum value, but doesn't maximize potential profits.** 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,500,000, but lower than my initial offer.  
* I will focus on explaining the benefits of the product and emphasizing why it's worth more than Bob's initial offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, there's still potential to secure a better price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees $1,650,000, but rejecting and counteroffering gives me a chance to get closer to my goal of $2,000,000.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  The option to sell to John provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail, but I'm not yet willing to settle for that amount. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,650,000 but lower than my previous offer. 
* I'll reiterate the product's unique benefits and emphasize its value in the current market."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer.  While I understand your financial situation, I believe this product's value warrants a price closer to $1,750,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've done some research and found that similar products are being sold for around $1600000 in the market.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,700,000, but higher than his current offer.
* I'll emphasize the unique features and potential of my product, arguing that it's worth more than similar products in the market. 
* I'll also try to understand why Bob is so fixated on the market price and see if I can address his concerns."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your research and the market price for similar products. However, this product offers unique features and potential that sets it apart.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:**  With only two rounds remaining, there's still a chance to increase the price.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe I can secure a better deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain some negotiation leverage and can potentially secure a higher price in the final rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $1,650,000, perhaps at $1,675,000, to test the waters and see if we can close the deal at a more favorable price. 
* I'll reiterate the unique value of my product and emphasize the potential for high returns on investment. 
* I'll need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and be prepared to accept a price closer to $1,650,000 if necessary, but I'll push for a higher price until the last round."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed the details of your product again and believe that $1625000 represents a fair value considering its unique features and potential benefits. I hope this proposal will help us reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation.
* **Unsatisfactory Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is still below my desired price range, and there's no time to counteroffer.
* **Guarantee the Minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me a minimum price of $1,500,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's final offer.

**Conclusion:**  While I was hoping to secure a higher price with Bob, it's better to accept John's offer and guarantee a decent profit than risk losing the deal altogether with Bob."
