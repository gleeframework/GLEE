"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm willing to meet in the middle and make a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $15200.
