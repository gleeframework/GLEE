Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is greater than your minimum price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price leaves room for both of you to adjust the price without going too far from your initial positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $11,500 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is still a good deal, it's lower than the $11,500 offer you made initially. You still have room for negotiation, and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point,  $10,750 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering and is getting closer to your initial asking price.  It's likely Bob is unwilling to go any higher, so accepting this offer secures a decent profit."
