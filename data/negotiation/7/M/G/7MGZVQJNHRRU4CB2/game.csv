"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,800.  Let's meet in the middle one more time. I'm willing to come down to $10,150. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,5,
