# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway?

I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob and I are getting too close to my bottom line, and it's not clear if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  John is a guaranteed sale, and it's better to secure a known profit than risk a long negotiation that might not result in a sale."
