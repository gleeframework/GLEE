"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
