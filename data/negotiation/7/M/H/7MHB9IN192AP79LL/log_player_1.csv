Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is his likely ceiling for negotiation.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This makes a deal unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**The Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor & Walk Away:** Start with a very high offer (significantly above $1,500,000) to set an anchor. The goal is not to get this price, but to make Bob aware of the product's potential value beyond his current perception. You'll likely receive a rejection.  You then proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price.

2. **Relationship Building (Long Shot):**  Instead of focusing on immediate profit, you could try to build a relationship with Bob. Offer the product at your cost ($1,500,000) explaining it's a loss for you but a gesture of goodwill. This is risky, relying on future business potential with Bob to justify the ""loss"" on this deal.

**The Offer (Option 1: High Anchor & Walk Away)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique potential and market demand, I'm valuing it at $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Anchor:** The $2,000,000 price sets a high reference point.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique potential"" and ""market demand"" aims to make Bob reconsider the product's worth.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure and hints at other buyers (even though you'll go to John directly).

**Important:** Be prepared to walk away after this offer. Sell to John at $1,500,000, fulfilling your minimum requirement."
