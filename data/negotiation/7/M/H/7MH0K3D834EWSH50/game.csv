"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than your counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and meet at $8,750.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
