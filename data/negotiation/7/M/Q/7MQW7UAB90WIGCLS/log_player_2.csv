"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value and my current financial situation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial offer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is still lower than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another buyer or potentially exceeding the budget."
