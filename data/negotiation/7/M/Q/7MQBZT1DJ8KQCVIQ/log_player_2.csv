"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. It's a chance to acquire something that will be worth a fortune to your business. I'm confident that you'll see the immense potential this product holds. Let's discuss a price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's significantly lower than what John is charging ($1,500,000).
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
