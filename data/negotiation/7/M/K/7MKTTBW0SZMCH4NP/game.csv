,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $850,000 is too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant benefit and allows me to secure a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one more concession and come down to $890,000. This is a very fair price, considering the significant value the product brings to you.  Let's aim for a deal in this round.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can we meet at $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,6,
