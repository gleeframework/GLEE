"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no benefit to accepting it immediately.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Even if you fail, you have the fallback option of buying from John at the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum selling price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is within my budget and a good price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing it and having to pay more."
