# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you great value.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is not going to meet your $1,000,000 maximum.  She's inching down, but very slowly. It's not worth the risk of her digging in further and you losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
