,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $125?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $125 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
