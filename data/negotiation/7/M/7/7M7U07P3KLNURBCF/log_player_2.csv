"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, potentially even more so than you realize. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is tempting, the price of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price from John. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and secure the best possible price."
