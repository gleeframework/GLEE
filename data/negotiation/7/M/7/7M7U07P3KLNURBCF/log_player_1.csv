Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, potentially even more so than you realize. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net a quicker sale and still a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly less than my minimum but still a substantial gain over Bob's perceived value.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing John's offer, I create a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might feel he needs to act before the opportunity is gone."
