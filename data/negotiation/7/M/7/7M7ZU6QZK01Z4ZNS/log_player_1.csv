Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which may make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard price, which allows for back-and-forth negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* If negotiations stall or don't seem promising, I'll switch to John, as he's guaranteed to buy at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.**  $600,000 is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic loss. 
* **I have a backup option with John.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I have no reason to rush into a deal that's so unfavorable.
* **Negotiation can continue.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering your interest and the value this product holds for you.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm bridging the gap between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($600,000). $900,000 is a significant drop for me but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize value and fairness:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and presenting this counteroffer as a fair solution for both of us.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** This counteroffer maintains an opportunity for further discussion and potential compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a decent price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or  make another counteroffer, always keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind.
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I will proceed to sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making concessions, and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my initial offer, $750,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John.** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price, which removes any pressure to settle for a significantly lower amount.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  I can continue to counter and potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining negotiation room:** I'm still open to further discussion and potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
