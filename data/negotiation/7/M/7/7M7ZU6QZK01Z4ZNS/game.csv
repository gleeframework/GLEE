"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering your interest and the value this product holds for you.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making concessions, and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
