Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose $1,000,000.  This aligns with my budget and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
