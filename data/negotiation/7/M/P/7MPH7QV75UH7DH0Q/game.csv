"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose $1,000,000.  This aligns with my budget and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find an agreement.  However,  $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's settle this right now - $1,125,000, and we have a deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
