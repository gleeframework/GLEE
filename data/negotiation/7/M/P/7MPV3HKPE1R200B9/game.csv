"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product but would be comfortable paying $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $105, and that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $115 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110 - that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,7,
