Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $12,000.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's based on the value of the product to me.  If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm going to sell to John. It's the most reliable way to get my minimum price and end this negotiation."
