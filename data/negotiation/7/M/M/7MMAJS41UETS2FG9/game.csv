"Alice, your product looks interesting, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I'm serious about acquiring this product, and I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $1200000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, reflecting the significant advantages this product can bring to your business.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000, which reflects a fair market value and a significant step towards closing this deal.  I believe this price is reasonable and allows for a successful partnership. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1400000 is closer to where we need to be, but it's still slightly below its true value. Considering the long-term benefits this product offers your business, I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial partnership. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. $1550000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, my absolute maximum, which I believe is fair given the value of the product and our potential partnership.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
