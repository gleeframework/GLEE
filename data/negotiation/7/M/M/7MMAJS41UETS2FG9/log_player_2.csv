Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks interesting, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'm serious about acquiring this product, and I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** Bob starts with a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $1200000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, reflecting the significant advantages this product can bring to your business.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which reflects a fair market value and a significant step towards closing this deal.  I believe this price is reasonable and allows for a successful partnership. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued negotiation:**  Bob shows he's willing to negotiate further, but still pushing for a price closer to his limit.

* **Partnership language:** Using ""successful partnership"" emphasizes a long-term relationship and mutual benefit, encouraging Alice to be more flexible."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1400000 is closer to where we need to be, but it's still slightly below its true value. Considering the long-term benefits this product offers your business, I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial partnership. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price, potentially reaching his target of $1,500,000 or lower. This could be a good opportunity to close the deal at a price that's even more favorable for him."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. $1,550,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, my absolute maximum, which I believe is fair given the value of the product and our potential partnership.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and final:**  Bob states his offer as his ""absolute maximum"", leaving no room for further negotiation from his end. 
* **Reinforces value and partnership:** The message highlights the value of the product and the potential partnership to encourage Alice to accept the offer.
* **Emphasis on win-win:** Bob emphasizes the benefits for both parties to make the offer more appealing.
