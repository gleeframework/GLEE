"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to go up to $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
