"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a very competitive price of $850,000. It's a steal for a product worth $800,000 to you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about we settle on $825,000? That's a fair price considering the value you place on this product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my asking price.  However,  $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my floor. It's a fair price considering the value you place on this product, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
