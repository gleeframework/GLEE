Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $750,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about we settle on $825,000? That's a fair price considering the value you place on this product."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While his offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my asking price.  However,  $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my floor.
