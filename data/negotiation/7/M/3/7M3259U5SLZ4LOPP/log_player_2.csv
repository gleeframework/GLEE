"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a very competitive price of $850,000. It's a steal for a product worth $800,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about we settle on $825,000? That's a fair price considering the value you place on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives him more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a fair price, given the value you placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're getting closer to my asking price.  However,  $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my floor. It's a fair price considering the value you place on this product, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget, and it matches the price he can get from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate as there's no potential for further savings. Accepting the offer secures the product at the best possible price for Bob."
