"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it very valuable. How does $140 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price from Alice. Rejecting her initial offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $120."
