"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept a higher price, even if it's a bit closer to his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but he should always be prepared to walk away and buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your potential savings from selling to John.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $950,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Since he has the option to get it for $1,000,000 from John, it makes more sense to go with that option and save $50,000."
