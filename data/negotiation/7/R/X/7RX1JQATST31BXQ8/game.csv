"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your potential savings from selling to John.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $950,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
