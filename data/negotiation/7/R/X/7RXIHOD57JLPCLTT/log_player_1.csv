"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $175?  It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $175 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145?  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm prepared to pay $130.  This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is tempting, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's important to remember that John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150, which is a safer bet than potentially getting stuck with a lower price with Bob."
