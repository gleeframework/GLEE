"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's work towards finding a mutually beneficial price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $650,000.  This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but it's also a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",650000.0,Bob,4,
