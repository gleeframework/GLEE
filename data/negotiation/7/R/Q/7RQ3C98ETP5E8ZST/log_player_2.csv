"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth more than $150 to me. Considering its worth to you is $80, I propose a fair deal where you can acquire it for $120. This price reflects the balance between its intrinsic value and your perceived worth, ensuring both parties are satisfied. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. While Alice's message emphasizes value, it's not a good deal for you. Buying from John will save you the most money."
