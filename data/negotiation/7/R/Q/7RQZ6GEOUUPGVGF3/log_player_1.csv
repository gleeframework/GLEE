Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Finding a Balance:** $145 is a price that allows me to make a significant profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's a $25 markup from his perceived value, but still cheaper than John's guaranteed purchase price.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. He might try to negotiate, or he might be completely unwilling to go above $120. However, this strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
