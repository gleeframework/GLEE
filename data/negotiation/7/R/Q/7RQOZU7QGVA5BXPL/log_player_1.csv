Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd sell to John, hoping to maximize my profit. I know Bob values the product at $100, so this price is still within the range where it's potentially appealing to him.  I'm open to negotiating, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  While I'd prefer to sell to him at a higher price, I'm not going to accept his offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping it's enticing enough for Bob to accept. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a decent profit margin for me."
