Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $115 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $122, but that's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $122.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation for a potential $2 savings, especially since you have a guaranteed option with John at $120."
