Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer gives me a good starting point and allows me to assess Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer,  showing I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product."
