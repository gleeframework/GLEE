Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $125."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he can bring the price down a little. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** While the product is worth $100 to Bob, and you'd accept $150 from John, aiming for $125 attempts to find a price beneficial for both parties. 
* **Clear and Simple:**  The message is straightforward and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $125.  He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives you a good starting point to maximize your potential profit."
