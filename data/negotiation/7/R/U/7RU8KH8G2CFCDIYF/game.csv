"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing the price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'd like to add that I'm willing to pay $1075000 if you can throw in some extras, such as a warranty or additional features. Can you consider this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate a better deal by offering to throw in some extras. I appreciate your creativity, but I'm not willing to include any additional features or warranties at this price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I can sell the product to you for $1075000, but I'll throw in a one-year warranty. This is my final concession.
