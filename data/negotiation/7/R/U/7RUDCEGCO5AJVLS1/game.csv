,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to buy the product now if you accept.",130.0,Bob,4,
