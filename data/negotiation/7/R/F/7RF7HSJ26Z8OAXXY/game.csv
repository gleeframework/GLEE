"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
