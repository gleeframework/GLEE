Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that your asking price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:** By suggesting you'll list the product publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know the product's value to Bob, he might try to negotiate a lower price. Be prepared to counter-offer or potentially meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Having John as a backup ensures you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum."
