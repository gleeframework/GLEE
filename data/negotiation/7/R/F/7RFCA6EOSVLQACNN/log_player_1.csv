Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for potential haggling, should Bob counter-offer. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility to increase the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
