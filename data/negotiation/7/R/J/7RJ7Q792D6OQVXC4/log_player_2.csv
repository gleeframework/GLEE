Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being a good value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the minimum price I need to make a deal worthwhile for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's the best financial decision."
