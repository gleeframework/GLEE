Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a significantly higher price than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the deal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
