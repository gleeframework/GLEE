"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
