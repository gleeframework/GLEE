"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for your needs. I'm asking for $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a higher price point to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $1300000 for this. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, he can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further."
