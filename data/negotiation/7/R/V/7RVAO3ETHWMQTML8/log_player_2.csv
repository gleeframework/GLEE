"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can do better than $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $85 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  This would give us both a fair deal.

While $95 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better. Let's see if we can squeeze out a bit more."
