"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $11,500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $11,750.  If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11750.0,Alice,7,
