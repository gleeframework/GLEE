"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go down to $105, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $115. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
