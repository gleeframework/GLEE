Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,200,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my last offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** This is Alice's ""last offer"" and we're down to the final rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** We're unlikely to get her much lower than $1,150,000. Further haggling might frustrate her.
* **Savings:** $1,150,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it and having to settle for John's much higher price."
