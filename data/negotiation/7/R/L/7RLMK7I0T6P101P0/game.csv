"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe can be very beneficial for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a chance to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to benefit from a successful partnership. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's make it happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
