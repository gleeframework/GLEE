"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $70 is a bit low for me. I can do $92, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $81?",81.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I can see we're getting close to a deal. I can do $88, which is still a good profit for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really close now.  I'd be happy to close the deal at $84.",84.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close.  I'm willing to split the difference one last time. How about $87, and we have a deal?",87.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already offered you a great deal at $90, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's as low as I can go. Let's finalize the deal!",89.0,Alice,9,
