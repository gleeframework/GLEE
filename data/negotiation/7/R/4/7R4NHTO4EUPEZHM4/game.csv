"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still feeling $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $10,900? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
