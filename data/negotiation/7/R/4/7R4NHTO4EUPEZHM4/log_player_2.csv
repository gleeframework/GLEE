"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still more than you want to pay. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to your target, you are still within a good number of rounds to continue negotiating. You have 7 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still feeling $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $10,900? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for $10,900, which is well below your maximum price of $12,000 and closer to your target price. With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you keep rejecting."
