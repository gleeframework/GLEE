Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (you have a guaranteed buyer at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, ideally getting closer to $1,500,000

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still exceeding your minimum. Here's the catch: Bob doesn't know your minimum price. You can use this to your advantage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence about the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **High but Negotiable:** $1,450,000 leaves you room for negotiation while still being a significant gain over your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and might make Bob less likely to counter with a low offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term benefit.

**Outcome**

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price favorable to you. If Bob rejects this offer, you're still in a strong position to sell to John at your desired minimum."
