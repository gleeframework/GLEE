"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm offering it for $1000000.  Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm aiming for.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
