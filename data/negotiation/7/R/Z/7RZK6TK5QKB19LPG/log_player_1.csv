{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm offering it for $1,000,000.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I know the product is worth more to him and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm aiming for.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000.  It's also closer to my target price than I expected to get at this point in the negotiation.  I'm happy with this outcome!"
