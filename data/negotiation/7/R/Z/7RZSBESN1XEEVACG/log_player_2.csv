"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still above your maximum price point. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92 is closer to your target, it's still a bit higher than you want to pay. It's worth trying to push Alice down a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $90. It's a good price, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still holding out for a price higher than your maximum. At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and secure the product for $80.  You've made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but it's time to move on."
