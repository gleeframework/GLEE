"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $15,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his target price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $16,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
