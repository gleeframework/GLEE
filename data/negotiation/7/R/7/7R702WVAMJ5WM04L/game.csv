"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $15000? I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget limit.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget limit, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $18000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'll meet you at $17000. That's as low as I can go. Is that a deal?",17000.0,Alice,5,
