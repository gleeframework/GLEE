It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price than $10,000.  There's a chance you can get closer to your $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is a good starting point for negotiation. I'm trying to get as close to my $8,000 goal as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering the risk of going back and forth with Alice or buying from John at $8,000."
