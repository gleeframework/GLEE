"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Starting with a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option to sell to John for $800,000 in mind ensures we have a fallback plan if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's crucial not to settle too early. Bob's counteroffer being significantly lower than our initial offer suggests there's room for negotiation. We'll aim to push him closer to $1,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still targeting a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Strong Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces our position and subtly discourages further lowball offers.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** We're still comfortably above John's offer, allowing us to walk away if Bob remains unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my original offer and your last offer. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating in smaller increments, indicating we're getting closer to his limit. While $950,000 is tempting, we still hold a time advantage and have room to push for a slightly higher price. We'll aim for $975,000 in the next round, testing his willingness to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting close. I appreciate your movement on this. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Justifying the Price:** By framing the price as reflective of the product's value, we reinforce our position and avoid appearing overly eager.
* **Time Pressure:** As we progress through the rounds, Bob should feel the pressure to reach an agreement before we potentially walk away to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'd like to get closer to my target. How about $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $960,000 is a very strong profit, significantly exceeding our minimum price and representing a successful negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for smaller increments might irritate Bob and risks jeopardizing the deal.  The potential gains at this point are outweighed by the risk of losing him.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now allows us to deploy the capital elsewhere sooner rather than later."
