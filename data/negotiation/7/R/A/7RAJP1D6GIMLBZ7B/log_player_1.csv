Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,300,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could we agree on $1,175,000? That would be a comfortable middle ground for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me.  To find a fair price for both of us, how about we settle on $1,250,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
