"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,300,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could we agree on $1,175,000? That would be a comfortable middle ground for both of us, I believe.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me.  To find a fair price for both of us, how about we settle on $1,250,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
