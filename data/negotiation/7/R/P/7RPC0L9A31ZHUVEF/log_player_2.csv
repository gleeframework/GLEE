"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's worth every penny, and I believe you'll find it highly valuable. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and he has an alternative seller (John) who is also willing to sell it for $12,000, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Bob can save no money by buying from Alice."
