Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and makes it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, but instead, I'm inviting Bob to engage in a negotiation. This signals I'm flexible and willing to find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and will adjust my strategy based on his actions. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to consider:

* **His counteroffer:**  How much is he willing to pay? Is it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation?
* **My risk tolerance:**  How confident am I in my ability to get a better price, or is it more prudent to accept his offer or sell to John for $12,000?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I might prefer to earn more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price in further rounds. There's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **John's Offer:**  John is also willing to pay $12,000, so accepting Bob's offer offers no advantage.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision, as it provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum threshold."
