* Alice's offer is $12,000, which is a decent price, but you can likely get a better deal.
* You have the option to counteroffer, giving you the chance to lower the price further.  

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you open up the possibility of saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so a price of $10,000 is still a decent profit for her.
* This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, making it likely she'll consider it.
* You are still within your budget, leaving room for potential further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for you, as you're willing to pay up to $15,000.
*  You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, suggesting further negotiation might be difficult.
*  While you could try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will refuse and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is the best strategy to secure the product at a price within your budget and avoid the risk of a higher price with John."
