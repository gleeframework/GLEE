{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but not so high that he'll immediately reject the offer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if necessary, and still make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."
