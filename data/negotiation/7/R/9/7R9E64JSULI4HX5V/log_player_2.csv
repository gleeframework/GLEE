"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) to see how much negotiating room there is. This gives Alice a chance to counter and keeps me further from my walk-away price.
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a good negotiating relationship, so my message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my price, $8,500 is still more than I want to pay.  I'm very close to my alternative with John, so I'll push for a better deal one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm only increasing my offer by a small amount ($500) to show I'm negotiating but holding firm to a reasonable price.
* **Suggesting Compromise:**  By phrasing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm appealing to Alice's sense of fairness and encouraging her to meet me in the middle.
* **Near Walk-Away Point:** I'm getting close to my alternative price with John ($8,000), so Alice needs to be close to my offer if she wants the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting the offer or going to John, as they'll both cost me the same."
