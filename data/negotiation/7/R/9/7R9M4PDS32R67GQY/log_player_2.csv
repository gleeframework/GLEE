"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,800,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product, I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1600000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,600,000 is still above his desired price point.  While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not budging below that. This is my final compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is determined to get the product for as close to his budget as possible. While Alice has stated her final offer, Bob still has some negotiating room. There are still rounds left, and it's worth trying to see if he can convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hesitant to go above my initial offer. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to increase my bid to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1300000, which is $1450000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,450,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his desired price point.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate, and there are still a few rounds left.  It's worth trying to see if he can convince Alice to come down further before considering the ""BuyFromJhon"" option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $1400000, Bob. I think we've been close enough. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1550000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

This is a tricky situation for Bob. Alice is not budging much further, and while $1,550,000 is closer than her previous offer, it is still higher than his initial goal.  With only one round left, the chance of convincing Alice to go lower is slim.  Given that John is offering a price within Bob's budget, it is the most logical choice to accept John's offer and move on."
