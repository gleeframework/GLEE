"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise and give you a good discount, but I still need to make a profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the lowest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
