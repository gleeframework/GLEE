"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice, closer to her $12,000 valuation. You always have John's $15,000 offer as a backup."
