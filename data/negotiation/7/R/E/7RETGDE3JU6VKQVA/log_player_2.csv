"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $155, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $155.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $150."
