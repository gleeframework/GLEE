"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I wouldn't normally entertain offers below $1500000, I'm willing to make a special exception in this case.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
