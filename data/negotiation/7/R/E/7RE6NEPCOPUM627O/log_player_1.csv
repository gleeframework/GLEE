Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $13,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" you subtly create a sense of urgency and desirability without explicitly revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is closer to your minimum, it still gives you some wiggle room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm with Bob if needed."
