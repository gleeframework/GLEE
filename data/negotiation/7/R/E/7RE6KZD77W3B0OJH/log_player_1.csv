"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob, starting at $130 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. His response will give you insights into his willingness to pay and inform your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good profit, we know Bob values the product at $150. There's still room to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we value the product higher and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're lowering our initial asking price to show Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Aim High, But Reasonable:**  $115 is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but it's still a good deal for him considering his perceived value. 
* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us understand how much negotiating power we have and whether Bob is willing to move closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $105?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. While $105 is tempting, we still have negotiating room and time to potentially secure a better deal. We're aiming for a price closer to $115, and rejecting this offer keeps that possibility open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $105 is still pushing it.  How about $110 and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Progress:** We're acknowledging Bob's movement by saying ""You're getting closer"" to encourage him to continue negotiating. 
* **Small Concession:** Lowering the price to $110 shows flexibility while still aiming for a price above the midpoint between our initial offers.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""and we have a deal,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency, suggesting this is our final offer, although we still have rounds left."
