"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to you, and John is willing to sell it for that price, it's best to buy from John immediately. There's no need to risk haggling with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
