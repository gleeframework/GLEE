"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""potential worth to you,"" I subtly remind Bob of the product's value, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, indicating my willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of securing a better price. Selling to John is my fallback option if the negotiations don't go well in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This reflects a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to the table."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage agreement."
