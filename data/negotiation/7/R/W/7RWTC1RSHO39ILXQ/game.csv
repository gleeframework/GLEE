"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, my maximum budget, for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $1,000,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I respect that. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer on this price point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm close to my budget,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1,030,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,015,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",1015000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you at $1,030,000 and come down to $1,030,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000, which is the same as your last offer. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,9,
