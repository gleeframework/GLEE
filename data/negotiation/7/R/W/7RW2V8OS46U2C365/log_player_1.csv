{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to push for a better price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,330,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could potentially push for a bit more, Bob is clearly negotiating in good faith and the increments are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,330,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or stalling the negotiations for too long."
