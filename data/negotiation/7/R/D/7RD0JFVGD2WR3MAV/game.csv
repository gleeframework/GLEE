"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  This still gives you a great price, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it's closer to your last offer. Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $8900 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle and settle on $8950? This is a small compromise that would get us both to a point where we can be happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen!",8950.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about $8925? This is a very small compromise on my part and would get us both closer to our ideal price.  Let's finalize this deal!",8925.0,Bob,8,
