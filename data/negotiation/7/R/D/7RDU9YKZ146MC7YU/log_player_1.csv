Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $12,000, so I have a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering.  Even if Bob is stubborn, I have the option of selling to John for $12,000 as a backup. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $8,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate further.  
* **Compromise:**  I'm dropping my price to $9,000, which is a compromise but still above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will persuade Bob to agree. If not, I'm prepared to either counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $8500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering.  Even if Bob is at his limit, John is willing to pay $12,000. 

I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise price of $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The message emphasizes that this price is a ""middle ground"" and highlights fairness for both parties.
* **Last Chance:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to agree. If not, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a significantly better price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, time is also a factor.  John is a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, which is much closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers and potentially wasting more time. 

It's time to secure the deal with John and get the best possible price for my product."
