**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $800,000. Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him not budging much further, potentially wasting time and leaving Alice with a less profitable outcome.  Selling to John secures the minimum acceptable price."
