(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price, but it's still a hefty chunk over what she values it at. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better deal.  If you reject this offer, you can try to get her price lower or resort to buying from John as your backup."
