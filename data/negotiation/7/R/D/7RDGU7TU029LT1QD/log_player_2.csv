"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You know the product is worth $8,000 to her, so there's room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and is above her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a lower price. I know she's willing to sell for $8,000, and there's still room for a counteroffer that would benefit both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $9,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate, but it's still well below her current offer and closer to the middle ground. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal but still aiming for a price that benefits me."
