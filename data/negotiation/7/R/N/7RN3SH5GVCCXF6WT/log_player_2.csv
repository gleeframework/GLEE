# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above your value and a significant savings for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $12,500. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $13,000 for the product? This still allows for a good profit margin while offering you a significant discount compared to my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $13,000 is significantly better than John's price of $15,000 and is closer to Bob's desired price.
* **No guarantee of further negotiation:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further, or even ending the negotiation entirely.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, potentially leading to missed opportunities or increased costs.

Accepting Alice's offer represents a good balance of saving money and closing the deal."
