"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that number, making $850,000 simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,100,000.  This reflects my best effort to reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
