"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find the value and accept the offer.  This strategy balances getting a good price while also incentivizing Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob by making a counteroffer.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a price closer to my desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is just a little too low for me. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm flexible but also that I value the product. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for him to accept.  The goal is to get as close to my target of $115 as possible, while also recognizing that the negotiation process will take time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $108 is closer to my target than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm going to continue trying to get a price closer to my desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm offering $109, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.  This demonstrates flexibility and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.  We're close to an agreement, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. Can you meet me at $107? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John, and I think this is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $107. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation process. Bob has made it clear that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. With only 4 rounds left, and the threat of Bob buying from John, accepting this offer is the best course of action. I'm still getting a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
