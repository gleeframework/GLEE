Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is definitely willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to settle at $780,000. I can see that you're getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to get a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}

It seems like Alice is no longer negotiating in good faith.  Her price went up significantly in the last round. It's time to walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
