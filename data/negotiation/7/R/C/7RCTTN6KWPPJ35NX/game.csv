"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and I pay $106?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
