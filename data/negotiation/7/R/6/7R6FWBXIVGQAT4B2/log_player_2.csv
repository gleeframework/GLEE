"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. To start negotiations, I propose a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. It's within your budget, but you want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counter-negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $850,000.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise between our previous offers."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to hold firm at $890,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to my target of $850,000.  While I'd prefer to get it even lower, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or me ending up buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's a reasonable price, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the product."
