{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to the product's worth to me, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested at this price, but I'm prepared to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, I can potentially do better.  I'm confident Bob is genuinely interested and will come closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my desired selling point.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
