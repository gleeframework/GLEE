Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving a significant profit margin for myself.  I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest level with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}

I'm going to counter with $19,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for him to accept while still leaving me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $17,000 is still a good deal for me.  At this point, it's getting risky to continue negotiating, as he could potentially offer less in the next round or walk away completely. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
