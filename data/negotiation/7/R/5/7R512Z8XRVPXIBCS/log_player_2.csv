"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. This is a one-time deal, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at its full value to you ($1,000,000). Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John to purchase the product for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice later or consider other options."
