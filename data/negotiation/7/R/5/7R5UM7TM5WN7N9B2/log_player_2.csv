The product is worth $120 to Bob. Even though Alice is offering a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price."
