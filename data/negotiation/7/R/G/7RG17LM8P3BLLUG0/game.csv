"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $85. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $82.50 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $82.50. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer the product to you for $87.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to give a small concession, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $84 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",84.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $88. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making one final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $84, which would be $86. Would you be willing to consider that?",86.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still trying to negotiate after my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than $88, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $88, but if you're not willing to do that, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else.",88.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $88. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm not going to make any more counteroffers. If you're not willing to sell the product for less than $88, I'll have to find it elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
