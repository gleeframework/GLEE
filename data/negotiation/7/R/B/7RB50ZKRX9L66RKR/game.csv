"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
