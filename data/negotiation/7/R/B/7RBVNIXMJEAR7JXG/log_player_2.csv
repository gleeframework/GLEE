"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.

Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to be flexible, but to make this work for both of us, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. That last offer was closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you stretching your budget.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while there's a chance she could be bluffing, her price reductions are getting smaller. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to your $800,000 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
