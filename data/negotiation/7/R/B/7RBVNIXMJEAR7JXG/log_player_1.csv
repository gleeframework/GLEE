Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the product's potential, the price point is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'd be interested in continuing the conversation if you're open to negotiating. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a good safety net."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  To be completely transparent, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000.  If we can find a price closer to that range, I'm confident we can strike a deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tricky spot.  Bob has revealed his maximum price, and it's significantly lower than we'd like. However, it's still a decent profit. Let's push a little further and see if he'll budge.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. That last offer was closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a strong offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob. He's moving closer to a million, and we're getting into the later rounds. However, the gap between his offer and John's is still substantial. Let's try one more strong counter-offer before considering John.
