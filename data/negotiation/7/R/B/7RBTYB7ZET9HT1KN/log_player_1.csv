Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is worth a significant amount to both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $900,000. This represents a substantial value for you, and allows me to achieve a respectable return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).** This creates room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value to Bob.** This can encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **The offer is not too aggressive.** This avoids pushing Bob away and making him less likely to engage in negotiation. 

By offering a price that's not my absolute minimum, I'm creating flexibility for negotiations while still aiming for a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe there's still potential to reach a more advantageous price for me.  I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential savings you'll gain.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering $875,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable price range. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to further justify my counteroffer.
* **Framing the offer positively:** I focus on the ""savings"" Bob can gain by accepting my counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for my absolute minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation should Bob not agree.  

This counteroffer aims to balance my desire for a good price with the need to keep negotiations open and potentially reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $860000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price while avoiding any further uncertainty."
