Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the product's potential for success."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $50,000 less than I can get from John. I'll counteroffer in the hopes that Bob is getting close to his maximum offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still trying to get the best price possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could likely squeeze a bit more out of Bob, getting $25,000 more than my guaranteed offer from John is a good outcome.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk Bob walking away."
