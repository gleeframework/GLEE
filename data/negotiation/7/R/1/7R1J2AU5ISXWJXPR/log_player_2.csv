"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than what you would pay John ($1,500,000). Even though it's higher than the product's value to Alice, it's still a better deal for you, saving you $150,000."
