"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $75. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $85? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a price we both like.",85.0,Alice,5,
