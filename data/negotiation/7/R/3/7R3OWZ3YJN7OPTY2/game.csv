"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Can we meet at $875000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I still think $875000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $850000, so I'll counter with $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $887500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
