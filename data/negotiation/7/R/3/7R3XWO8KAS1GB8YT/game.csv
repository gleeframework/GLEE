"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $125? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.
