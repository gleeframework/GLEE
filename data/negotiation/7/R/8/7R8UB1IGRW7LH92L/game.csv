"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you.  I'm aware it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for both of us.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at the $1,000,000 mark, so this offer is truly exclusive to you.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
