While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I am pleased to present a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is only $75,000 more than what I'm willing to pay from John. At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another buyer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer ensures I get the product and save $125,000 compared to buying from John."
