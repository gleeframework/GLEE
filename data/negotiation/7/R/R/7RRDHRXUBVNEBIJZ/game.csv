"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me, and it's still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too far below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,500, but that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
