{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me, and it's still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum value:** This ensures I still make a profit, and I'm not giving away the product for less than it's worth to me. 
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can then consider lowering the price slightly to meet him halfway, or if he makes a counteroffer, I can gauge his interest and decide whether to accept or counter further. 

This approach allows for flexibility and a better chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price while still securing a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000, and even below his own valuation of $8,000. It's not a viable option for me.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I can still get a better price than this, and I'm not desperate to sell it immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too far below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
