Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and open to negotiation, but I'm also confident in the product's value. 

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit while keeping Bob interested. 
* I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if negotiations fail. 
*  Offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value gives him room to feel like he's getting a good deal and encourages negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* While I want to close the deal, selling for $10,000 would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* I'm also aware of John's offer, which is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 
*  Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves some room for you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm remaining friendly and open to negotiation, but I'm firm in my desire for a price closer to my value.

**Reasoning:**

* I need to recoup some of the lost profit from Bob's initial offer, but I also don't want to push him away completely. 
* This counteroffer shows flexibility while still demonstrating the value of the product.
*  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more affordable. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

* While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* John's offer of $12,000 is a secure and acceptable option, ensuring I meet my minimum goal.
*  Selling to John will guarantee I receive my minimum desired profit and avoid the risk of a protracted negotiation with Bob."
