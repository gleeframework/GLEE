"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000.  It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both committed to reaching a fair price.  I'm willing to drop to $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I think it's a price that reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to come to an agreement.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm going to have to stick to my last offer of $1,250,000.  This is the best price I can offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're willing to stick to $1,250,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
