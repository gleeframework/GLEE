Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and makes the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room to potentially lower the price if necessary, but I'm not starting too low, as I want to maximize my profit. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me confidence that I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little too high for me right now. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $7,000 is a bit too far below my asking price. I'd be willing to come down to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive approach to keep the negotiation open and prevent it from becoming adversarial.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm leaving a bit of wiggle room in case Bob needs to come down a little further.
* **John's offer as a backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me the confidence to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could potentially do $7,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $7,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, it's still not a profitable deal for me.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:** I'm willing to give Bob one more chance, but I'll need to make a strong counteroffer to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 gives me confidence to push for a better price or walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $8,000?  That's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my last offer, highlighting that I'm serious about closing the deal but still seeking a fair price.
* **Strong but Reasonable:** $8,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but is still within the realm of what he's willing to pay (remember, he values the product at $8,000).
* **Direct and to the Point:**  The message is concise and focused on getting Bob to make a decision.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if Bob doesn't accept this final offer."
