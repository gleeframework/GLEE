"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this work. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. $12,200 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet halfway.  Let's settle on $12,350. It's a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers.  What do you say?",12350.0,Alice,5,
