"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start around the $600,000 mark?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's immense potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has potential, but we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but accepting $700,000 would be selling this product far below its value.  Let's settle this right now: $950,000.  It's a firm offer, and a fair price considering what you're getting.",950000.0,Alice,5,
