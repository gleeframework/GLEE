"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start around the $600,000 mark?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's immense potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has potential, but we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but accepting $700,000 would be selling this product far below its value.  Let's settle this right now: $950,000.  It's a firm offer, and a fair price considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""firm offer"" of $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation when you have a sure option to buy within your budget."
