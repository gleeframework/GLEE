Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, Alice can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
