"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  This shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a range that might be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $9,000.  While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there is still a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get it a little closer to $8,500. Would you consider $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. $8,750 is a good compromise,  demonstrating that Bob is willing to negotiate further while still aiming for a price that benefits him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $9,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price than $9,200.  While Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, there's still room for a better deal. Bob can continue to counteroffer and see if Alice will go lower. If Alice continues to refuse, Bob might consider buying from John at $12,000, but only as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still trying to make this work for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price that would let us both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push towards a price he feels is fair. He's offering $9,000, which is closer to Alice's latest offer.  This shows Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might need to consider purchasing from John as his time is running out."
