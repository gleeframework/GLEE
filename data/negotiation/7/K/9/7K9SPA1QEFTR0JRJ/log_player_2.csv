"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range.

It's important to provide a reason for your counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and your willingness to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

What do you think?
