Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Even though it's a ""meet you halfway"" offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $155, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's time for Bob to move on and buy the product from John.  While it may not be the absolute lowest price, it's within Bob's budget and a better option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
