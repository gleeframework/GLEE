Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to your price. She's rejected your offer of $80 twice and is holding firm above $90.  At this point, it's best to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $80."
