"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested, but I've already got another interested buyer ready to pay the full $1,200,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's message is bluffing. She knows you have John as a backup option at $1,200,000, which is her product's actual value to her. By saying she has another buyer, she's trying to pressure you into accepting a higher price.  You can safely reject her offer and buy from John."
