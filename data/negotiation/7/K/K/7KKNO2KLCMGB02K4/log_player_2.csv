"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is truly unique and I believe it will be invaluable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($11,500 vs. $10,000). While she claims it's worth $12,000 to you, you know you have another option at that price.  By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $12,000."
