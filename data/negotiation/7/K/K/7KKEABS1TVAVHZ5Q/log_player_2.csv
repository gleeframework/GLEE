"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. However, it's not unreasonably low, giving Alice some room to compromise. 
* **Focus on Budget:** The message emphasizes your budgetary constraints, making it clear that you're serious about the deal but need a lower price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,200,000.  There's still room for further negotiation, and buying from John remains an option if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:**  We're gradually moving closer to Alice's offer while still remaining within our budget.
* **Finality:** The message conveys that $1,250,000 is our absolute limit, creating pressure for Alice to make a decision.
* **Focus on Finalizing:**  Emphasizing ""finalizing the deal"" reinforces the need for a quick resolution."
