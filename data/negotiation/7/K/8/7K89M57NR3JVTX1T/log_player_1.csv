I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob without immediately triggering a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $13,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial valuation, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $14,000. This is still above Bob's valuation but closer to his offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm concerned that further negotiation may not result in a significantly higher price.  Given the opportunity to sell to John for my desired price, I'm choosing to sell to John."
