Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle at a price above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" to entice Bob and justify the high price.
* **Backup Option:**  It's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations."
