"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation. My goal is to maximize profit, and this gives me the best chance to secure a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Confident Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential"" and ""return on investment,"" I'm framing the high price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While my initial price is high, the phrasing implies I'm open to discussing the price further. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted. I would be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value for the product. This indicates room for negotiation. While I could sell to John for my minimum right now, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob with some strategic counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Explanation:** I'm clearly rejecting Bob's initial offer but providing a reason that positions the rejection as related to the product's inherent value, not just my desire for a higher price.
* **Significant Concession (but above the minimum):** My counteroffer of $1,500,000 is a substantial drop from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it remains comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate further while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Call to Action:** I'm reiterating the product's value while acknowledging Bob's interest, encouraging him to engage further in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum selling price of $1,200,000 and shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk of pushing Bob away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
