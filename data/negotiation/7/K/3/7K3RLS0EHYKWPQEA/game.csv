"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted. I would be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
