Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product at $20,000. It's a fantastic value and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how he might negotiate. His response will dictate my next move. 
* **John as Backup:**  I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than his stated perceived value of $10,000, suggesting he may be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its quality and what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I've come down from my initial offer but not drastically. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about the product's value.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Limit:** My offer is still above Bob's likely limit, but it gives us space to potentially meet in the middle, somewhere closer to my $15,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason (quality and functionality) for the price, reinforcing its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering what I've seen so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is above my absolute minimum of $15,000. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating genuine interest. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could push for $15,000, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting $14,000 now secures a good profit."
