"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business.  It's something I've carefully developed, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  This price reflects the considerable value I've invested in it, but also allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired maximum price of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with John or find another seller who might be willing to sell the product for a lower price closer to his maximum budget."
