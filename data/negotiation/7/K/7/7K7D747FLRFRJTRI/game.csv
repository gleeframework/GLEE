"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However,  $9,800 is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it.  Could you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you've invested in the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,4,
