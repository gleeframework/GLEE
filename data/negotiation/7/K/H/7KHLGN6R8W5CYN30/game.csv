"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $150, but I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $145. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
