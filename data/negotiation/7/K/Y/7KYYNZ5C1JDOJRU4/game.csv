"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
