"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a bit aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to start high and hopefully land somewhere closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I have 8 rounds left to potentially get closer to my desired value.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a substantial discount while still allowing me to reach my minimum target. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel we might be able to find a better balance. Could you consider bringing the price down to $1,250,000? I believe this would be more aligned with my budget while still allowing me to secure the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low.  I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better deal. I'm going to try and counter again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This price would allow me to make a fair profit while still being very competitive for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for a fair profit, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $1,225,000? This would be closer to what I am prepared to pay, while still allowing you to achieve a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,225,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have four rounds left and I believe I can potentially push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible, but $1,225,000 is still just a bit below where I need to be. Let's compromise at $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I am still unable to agree to $1,250,000. Could you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? This would be more aligned with my budget and still provide a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is stubbornly sticking to his price.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, as that's my minimum acceptable price."
