Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product at a price of $16,000. I believe it will greatly benefit you, and this is a very competitive offer considering its true worth."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief justification can make your offer more persuasive. By mentioning ""true worth"" and ""competitive offer,"" you subtly imply the product's value might even be higher.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know your minimum.  This puts you in a strong negotiating position.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a strategy for how low you are willing to go will be crucial."
