"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I want to maximize my profit but also leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $8,000.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round to see if we can reach a more mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a little above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $8,000. I'm going to counter again, but I'll need to be careful about how much lower I go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $8,200. This is still above my minimum, but I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm also mindful that I only have 5 rounds left before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time.  I'm not comfortable accepting his last offer, and I don't want to risk going another round and potentially getting an even lower offer. It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
