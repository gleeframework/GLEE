"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still capped at $800000.  This is a final offer from me - I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
