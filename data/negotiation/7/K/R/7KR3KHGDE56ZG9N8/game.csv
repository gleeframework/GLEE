"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $11,500, what do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
