Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $780,000 is a fair price for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $790,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I can do better. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $815,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking very close to her original offer, and we're running out of rounds. While her latest offer of $815,000 is lower than John's price, the potential savings are no longer worth the risk of Alice not budging further. It's very likely Alice will try to squeeze out a few more thousand, leaving Bob with a less appealing deal than John's flat $1,000,000.  

At this point, securing the product at a known, albeit slightly higher price from John makes the most sense to avoid walking away with nothing."
