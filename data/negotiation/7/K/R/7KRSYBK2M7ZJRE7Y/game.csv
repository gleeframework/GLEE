"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $820,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000? I believe that's a fair compromise for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $830,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",830000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $830,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects my strong interest in the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $780,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think I can do better. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $810,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $790,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $790,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I can do better. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $815,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,9,
