Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and land at $900,000? This reflects the true value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
