"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $125. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
