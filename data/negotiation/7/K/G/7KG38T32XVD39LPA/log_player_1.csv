"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a little more.  This is a good starting point to potentially reach a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the product's value. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's try $130. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the highest he's willing to go. While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my minimum acceptable range and higher than what John is offering. It's best to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
