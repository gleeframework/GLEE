Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for less from John, or negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has a better option with John, who will sell the product for $10,000.  There's no reason to pay more."
