"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount. There's a good chance that Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since you have a fallback option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise. If Alice is willing to negotiate, she's likely to counter with a price closer to my offer than her initial price. If she rejects this counteroffer, I can then adjust my next counteroffer accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is significantly closer to my ideal price. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or me running out of time is increasing. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price without risking a more expensive purchase from John."
