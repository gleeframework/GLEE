While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,750,000, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 plus the 30-day warranty is acceptable at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a substantial profit over our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and gets us the money sooner.
* **Warranty Cost:** The 30-day warranty shouldn't be a major expense for a product of this value. It likely won't significantly impact our profit margin.

Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away, and John's offer is no longer better than what Bob is proposing."
