"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is very valuable, how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While I see the value, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $15,000? This would be my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
