Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential""  provides a reason for the high price, even if it's subjective. 
* **Leaving the door open:**  Phrases like ""Let me know what you think"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just saying a flat ""no.""

**Worst case:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

**Best case:**  Bob counters with a lower offer, and you negotiate a final price closer to your initial ask."
