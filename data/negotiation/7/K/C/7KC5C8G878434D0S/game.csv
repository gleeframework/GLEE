I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to go to $11500? This feels like a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.,11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $13000, which is $12250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Alice,5,
