Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $675,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $725,000.  This price is significantly lower than John's $1,500,000 offer, making it a good deal even if it's slightly above my ideal target. It's time to accept and secure the savings."
