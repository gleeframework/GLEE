I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'm always aware of John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm interested in selling, I'm not desperate. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if there's any wiggle room in his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price higher than Bob's offer.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point, and we're only $1,000 apart. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $14,000 goal, accepting his offer at $12,000 is a reasonable outcome. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for a higher price."
