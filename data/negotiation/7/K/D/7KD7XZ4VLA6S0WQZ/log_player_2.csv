"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is lower than his maximum budget of $15,000, it's still too high. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $11,500.  Here's why:

* **It's within his budget:** $11,500 is less than his maximum budget of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal:**  He's getting a better price than John's offer of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get him a significantly lower price:** Alice has already moved a bit closer to his initial counteroffer, and further negotiation could risk her walking away from the deal entirely."
