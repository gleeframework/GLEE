"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
