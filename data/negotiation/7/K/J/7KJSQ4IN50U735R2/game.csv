,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. Let's get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
