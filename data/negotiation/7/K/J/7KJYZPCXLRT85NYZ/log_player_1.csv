{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident this deal would be beneficial for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I want for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet your price.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I hope you'll consider it a good faith effort to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
