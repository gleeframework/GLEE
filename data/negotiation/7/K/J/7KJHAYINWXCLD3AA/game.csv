"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $9,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to spend.  How about $7,000?  That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,500. It's still a good deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
