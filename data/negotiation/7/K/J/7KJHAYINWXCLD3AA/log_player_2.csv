Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,500. It's still a good deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  It's better to secure the product at the known $8,000 price from John than to risk Alice sticking to her current offer."
