Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
