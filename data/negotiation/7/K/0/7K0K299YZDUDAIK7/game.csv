"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a little higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
