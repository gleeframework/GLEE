,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your asking price and the value I see in it.  Let me know if you're open to this.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,500 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This reflects the product's true value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
