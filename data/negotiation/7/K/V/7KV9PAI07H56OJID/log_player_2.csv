{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is close to his ideal price. While a bit higher than John's offer, Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, and accepting saves the time and energy of continued negotiation. There's a risk that further negotiation could result in a higher price, or Alice could become unwilling to deal.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk a worse outcome."
