"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to Bob.  Since Alice is offering $130, there is room to negotiate.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, he can still get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's still room to negotiate.  He should try to counteroffer and see if he can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back down to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $132. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has offered $132, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price. It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.  Considering that buying from John would cost $150, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this situation."
