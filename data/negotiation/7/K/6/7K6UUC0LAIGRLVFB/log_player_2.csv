# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a one-time deal of $120. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $30.** 

While the product might be worth less to you than the offer, it's still a better deal than buying from John."
