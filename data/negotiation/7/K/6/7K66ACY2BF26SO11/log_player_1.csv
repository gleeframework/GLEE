Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 allows you to potentially earn a $300,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as exclusive, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price.  You can always lower your asking price, but you can't go higher once an offer is made."
