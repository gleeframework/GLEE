"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also not starting too high that it immediately discourages him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  However, I know the product is worth $120 to him, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $110. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to get as close to my target price as possible. Hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering less than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to sell for $95. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $105.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. It's a bit lower than my ideal price, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair compromise given that he's already offered $95. We are getting closer to the end, and I need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than what John is offering.  I'm running out of time and the negotiation is not moving in a positive direction.  I'll sell the product to John for $100,  as it's the best option for me at this point."
