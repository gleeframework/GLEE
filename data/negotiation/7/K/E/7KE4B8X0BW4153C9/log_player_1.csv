{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a real steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, aiming to leave room for negotiation. It also includes a positive message to build rapport and highlight the product's value. This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $12,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $13,500? I'm confident this price still represents excellent value for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is close to my desired price.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale for a good price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a sale to John at a lower price."
