"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be mindful of my costs. How about we try $7,500 again, or even $7,000 if you're willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not budging significantly from his initial lowball offer. It's unlikely he'll reach the $8,000 threshold I need. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
