Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $87.50. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:

This is a good deal! Getting the product for $87.50 meets my goal of spending less than $120. Pushing further might annoy Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower."
