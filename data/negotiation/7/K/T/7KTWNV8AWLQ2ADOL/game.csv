"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price of $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $110. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $105, which is closer to your offer. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can you consider that?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'll offer you a price of $102, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
