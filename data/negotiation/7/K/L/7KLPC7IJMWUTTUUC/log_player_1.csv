Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It is significantly higher than your minimum price, giving you room to negotiate. However, it's not unreasonable given the potential value of the product. 

This approach allows for the following:

* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for you to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Signals Confidence:** It signals to Bob that you believe the product is valuable and you are not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Protects Your Interests:** If Bob is unwilling to meet your price, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low,  it's significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I will counteroffer and aim to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This counteroffer is still above your minimum price, but it's significantly lower than your initial offer. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also protects your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price and I'm not confident I can negotiate him up to a price I'm happy with. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
