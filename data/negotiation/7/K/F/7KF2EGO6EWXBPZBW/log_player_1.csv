Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $8,000. Taking John's guaranteed offer ensures I don't risk losing out on the minimum acceptable value."
