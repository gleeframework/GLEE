Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to remember that I'm trying to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'm not thrilled about accepting John's offer, it's the best option at this point.  I've gone through 10 rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't been able to get him to agree to a price that meets my minimum requirement.  It's better to sell to John and secure the sale rather than risk losing the deal completely."
