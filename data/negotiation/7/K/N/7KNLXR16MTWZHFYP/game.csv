"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm thinking of a price of $8800. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
