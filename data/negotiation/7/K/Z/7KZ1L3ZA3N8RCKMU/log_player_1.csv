Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity to offer you. This product, I believe, could significantly benefit you, and I'm offering it at a price that reflects its immense value.  Are you interested in discussing a price around $1,150,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. It avoids being overly aggressive while still positioning the price as significant. Asking if he's ""interested in discussing"" a price around $1,150,000 gives him a chance to counter-offer without outright rejecting your initial proposal.
* **Product Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you a significant profit margin ($150,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., whether he's highly competitive or more collaborative), you might adjust your approach.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net,  mentioning other potential buyers could strengthen your position. However, be careful not to make it sound like a bluff if it isn't true.
