"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
