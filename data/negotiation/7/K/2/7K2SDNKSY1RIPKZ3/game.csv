,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,7,
