,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our desired price points. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  I'll accept $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is my final offer.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach our goals. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,300,000.  However, I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
