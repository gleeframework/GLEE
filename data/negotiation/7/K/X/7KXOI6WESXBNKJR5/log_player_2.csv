"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if you can get closer to your target price. There are 9 rounds remaining, providing plenty of opportunity for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the product's value to me and aiming for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strategic Room:**  This offer leaves room for further negotiation, as I'm still below my maximum budget and there are multiple rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our desired price points. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** I'm making a smaller adjustment to my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet her halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  I'll accept $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is my final offer.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach our goals. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,300,000.  However, I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Limit:**  We are very close to my maximum budget.  While Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is tempting, it's still above my ideal price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There are only 3 rounds remaining, and the potential for saving an additional $15,000 is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees a lower price of $1,200,000, which is within my budget and a safe option. 

It's time to secure the deal with John."
