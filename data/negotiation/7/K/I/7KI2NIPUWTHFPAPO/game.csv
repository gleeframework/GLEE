"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $120 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my original offer.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
