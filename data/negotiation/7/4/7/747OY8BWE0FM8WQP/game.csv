"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To accommodate your budget while still providing value, I am willing to consider an offer closer to your proposed price.

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm eager to make this purchase, $15000 is still slightly outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
