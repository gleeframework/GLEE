"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000.
