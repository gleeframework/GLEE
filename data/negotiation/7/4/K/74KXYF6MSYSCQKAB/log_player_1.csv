Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value you mentioned earlier. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,500 is still a bit too low."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to meet at $10,750? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price. While $10,800 is better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not going to settle just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm really hoping to get $11,000 for this product.  It's truly worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that price.  Can we compromise at $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,900. I'm willing to go up to $10,700, and that's my final offer. I hope you can meet me there.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher than $10,700. While it's a shame to miss out on a higher price, it's better than losing out on the deal entirely."
