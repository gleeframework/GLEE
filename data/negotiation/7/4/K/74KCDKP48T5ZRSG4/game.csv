"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $10500. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great deal while also recognizing the product's worth. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $11000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a more aggressive counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $10000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $11500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10250, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I appreciate the time we've spent negotiating, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $10750, but that's the absolute maximum I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",10750.0,Bob,10,
