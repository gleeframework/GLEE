"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Reasoning:  Even though Bob's offer is better than his first one, it's still far below my minimum price of $15,000. I'll try to counteroffer him to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $11,000 is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still reflects the product's value, but allows for some flexibility. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my budget. $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reasoning: While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm hoping to see if I can get a little closer with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I value our potential business relationship.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $12,750?  This seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of your product while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Reasoning:  Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of time and it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
