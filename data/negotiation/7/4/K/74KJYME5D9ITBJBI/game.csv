"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and meeting at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show my commitment to this deal.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers to your business, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
