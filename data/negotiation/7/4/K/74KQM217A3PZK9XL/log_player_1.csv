Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $2,000 profit margin between what Bob values the product at and your minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that profit margin as possible. However, going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer and you ending up with your $10,000 from John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it can be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob wants to counter-offer) but secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Positive Language:**  The message focuses on value and excitement, encouraging Bob to see the product's worth. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You might choose to start even higher, especially if you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.  Factors like your risk tolerance and any additional information you have about Bob (his negotiation style, how badly he needs the product) could influence your strategy."
