Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is fair to both of us. It's above my minimum price of $100 and below Bob's maximum price of $150.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price under $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still willing to hold out for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
