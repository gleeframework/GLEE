Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to try and maximize my profit while still potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. There is potential to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows good faith while still allowing for some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than Bob's initial offer and is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It also avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price than I'd prefer."
