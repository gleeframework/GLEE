"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, given the value you place on the product and my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This still allows you a significant gain, and it's a reasonable compromise from my end. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize the transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
