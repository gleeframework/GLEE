Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your floor price of $10,000, but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still keeping Bob interested in the deal."
