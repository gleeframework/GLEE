"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $1,100,000 is still too high, and there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings makes it difficult to accept that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a significant gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my target.  I'll counter again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your coming down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $987,500.  This price is a good compromise and allows both of us to get a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is still too high for my goal.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price. If not, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, but unfortunately, that's still outside my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering my final price of $975,000.  It's a good price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
