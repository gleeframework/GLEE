Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this revised price represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a significant return, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer up to $700,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both the product's worth to me and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement from his side to consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I recognize you're moving closer to a fair price, but we still have a significant gap to bridge. To show flexibility on my side, I'll counter at $1,650,000. This offer reflects my willingness to find a compromise while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. To be candid, anything above $800,000 is not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final attempt to reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has essentially revealed his maximum valuation at $800,000. His offer of $750,000 confirms this is his limit. It's clear that further negotiation with him will not yield a satisfactory outcome for me.  I can secure my desired price by selling to John immediately, so there's no point in continuing with Bob."
