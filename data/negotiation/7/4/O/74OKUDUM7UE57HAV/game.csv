"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this revised price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a significant return, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer up to $700,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I recognize you're moving closer to a fair price, but we still have a significant gap to bridge. To show flexibility on my side, I'll counter at $1,650,000. This offer reflects my willingness to find a compromise while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. To be candid, anything above $800,000 is not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final attempt to reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
