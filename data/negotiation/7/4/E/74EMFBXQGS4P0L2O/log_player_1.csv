Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that this is Bob's best chance to buy.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation of $8,000. 
* There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit."
