"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. It makes sense to reject the first offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $12,000?  This would still represent a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

You still have room to bargain. $12,000 is closer to your ideal price, but it's still worth seeing if you can get it lower."
