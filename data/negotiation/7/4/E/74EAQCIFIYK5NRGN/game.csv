"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $13,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $12,000?  This would still represent a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. ",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm feeling $11,500 is a fair price.  It's a good deal for you, and I'm ready to close if it works for you.",11500.0,Bob,4,
