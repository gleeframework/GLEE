"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $11,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I am still unable to move beyond my budget of $10,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $10,500. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10500.0,Bob,4,
