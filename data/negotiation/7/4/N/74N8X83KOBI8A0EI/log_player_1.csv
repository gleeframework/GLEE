"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a good midpoint between our offers.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $13,500 is a good compromise and still nets a profit above my minimum."
