"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember:

* **I have a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000. This gives me a baseline and makes me less likely to accept low offers.
* **I need to gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will tell me a lot about his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a higher price. I'm not ready to sell for $12,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting and potentially ending up with John's $10,000 offer. 

$13,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a better outcome than selling to John."
