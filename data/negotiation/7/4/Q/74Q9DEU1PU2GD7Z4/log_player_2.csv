"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $130 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, I still think the product is worth more than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his budget of $150.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $130 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us and it would help me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $132.50. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped the price to $132.50, which is still higher than Bob's preferred price but now within his budget of $150.  It's a good deal for Bob, as it's the lowest Alice has gone so far. It's time to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
