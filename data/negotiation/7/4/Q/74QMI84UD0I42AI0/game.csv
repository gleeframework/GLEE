"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $14000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good value for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13750. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,
