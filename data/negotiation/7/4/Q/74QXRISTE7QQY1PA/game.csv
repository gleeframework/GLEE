"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is a considerable investment on my part, reflecting the product's true worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
