Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 presents a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $400,000 discount from my bottom line ($1,500,000 minimum).
    * I make a $400,000 profit over Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" are designed to encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent him from lowballing or overthinking. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher reward."
