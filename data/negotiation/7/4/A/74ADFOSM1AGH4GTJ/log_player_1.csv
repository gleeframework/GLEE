Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to you.  While you can't get your ideal price, you can still likely negotiate a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7,000.  How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum value.  Further negotiation with Bob might yield a better result, but the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential gain at this point."
