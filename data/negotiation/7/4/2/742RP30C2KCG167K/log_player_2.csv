"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $15,000, but you can negotiate with him to try and lower the price closer to your desired range."
