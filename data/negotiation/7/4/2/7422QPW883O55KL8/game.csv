"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900. This is really a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
