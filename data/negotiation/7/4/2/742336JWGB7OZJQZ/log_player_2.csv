Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, stating you value it at $1,500,000 when you've set that as your absolute maximum.  While her offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the door for a counter-offer closer to Alice's actual valuation."
