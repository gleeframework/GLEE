Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want to get as much as possible, so starting at $95 is a good place to begin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counteroffers, you have space to negotiate without dropping below your minimum. 

Let me know if you want to make a different offer, or if you'd like me to handle the negotiation with Bob based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a $100 budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and try to reach a price closer to your goal of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good price.
* **Value proposition:** You're reminding Bob that $90 is still a good deal for him, as it's below the $100 value he places on the product.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's still room to lower the price slightly without going below your minimum."
