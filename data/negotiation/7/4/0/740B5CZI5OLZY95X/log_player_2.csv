"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
