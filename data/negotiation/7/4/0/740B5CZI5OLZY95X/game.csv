"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
