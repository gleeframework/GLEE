"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,,

"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm starting to get a bit hesitant to go any lower, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $122. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, Bob. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to give it away. If you're not willing to meet me at $120, I'm going to have to consider selling it to John. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a decision. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,115.0
"I've made a good offer of $115, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'm considering buying the product from John for $80, so I'd like to finalize the deal at $115.",115.0,Bob,10,,
