"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this unique product.  I'm prepared to accept $900000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet her halfway at $850000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,4,
