"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  While I'm interested, I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $860000. This is a very good price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",860000.0,Alice,5,
