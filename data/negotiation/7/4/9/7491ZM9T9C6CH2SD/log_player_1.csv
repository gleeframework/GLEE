Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still staying above our minimum of $100. 
* **John as a Backup:** We have the security of John's $100 offer, so we're not pressured to accept anything below that.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but not outrageous offer, we increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price that benefits us most."
