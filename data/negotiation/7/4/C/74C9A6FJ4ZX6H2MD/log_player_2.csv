Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'll reject and continue negotiating for a better price. I'm still willing to pay slightly more than John's offer if it means closing the deal with Alice, but I'm not going to jump at the first opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject and try to get a lower price. I'm running out of rounds, but I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going all in with John's price, since this is the final round before I have to commit to John.  If Alice accepts, great! If not, I'll move on to John."
