"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $102.50. Can we meet in the middle at $97.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $100 is my absolute bottom line.  It's a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it lets me cover my costs.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
