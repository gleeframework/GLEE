Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.  It also ensures a profit even if Bob manages to negotiate the price down slightly.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" of the product, subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **""Special Price"" Tactic:**  Framing it as a ""special price"" creates a sense of urgency and opportunity for Bob.

**It's important to remember:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This strong fallback position allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
