,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my maximum budget, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my lowest price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. It's my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my next best offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm not comfortable going above my initial offer of $800000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a minimum of $1100000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
