"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested and counter with a lower offer, giving us a starting point for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can close the deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation or having to settle for John's offer."
