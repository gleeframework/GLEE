"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm trying to be fair here.  $7,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,125? It's a good deal for both of us.",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $7,900? That's the best I can do.",7900.0,Bob,6,
