Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000), but still leaves me with a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust my strategy accordingly. I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $10,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a good profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but if he rejects, I'll reconsider selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still too low. I've made a couple of concessions and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower.  John is offering a much better price, and I'm going to take his offer."
