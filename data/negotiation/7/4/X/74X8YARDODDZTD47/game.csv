,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $80? I'm happy to pay that, but I'm not sure I can go higher.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to go up to $90 for the product?",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $90 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",85.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,92.0
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, so I'll offer you $87.50. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",87.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $87.50.  Let's split the difference again - how about $86.25?  It's still a great deal for me, and hopefully, it's fair for you.",86.25,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,88.0
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $86.25, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle again, at $88.125? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price for both of us.",88.125,Alice,7,,
