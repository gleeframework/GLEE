"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $150.  Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $155, which is a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $160, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
