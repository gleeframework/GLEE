This offer starts by highlighting the value for Bob and then quickly establishes the price. I've priced it above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$90 is too low for me, even though it's a better offer than before. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it that low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?  That's a good price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is still too low. I'm tired of negotiating, and John is offering me my minimum price. I'll sell to John."
