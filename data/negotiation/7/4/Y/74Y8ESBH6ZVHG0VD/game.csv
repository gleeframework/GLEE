"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. ",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $11,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $13,000? I feel that's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm seeing we both value this product.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $15,500.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
