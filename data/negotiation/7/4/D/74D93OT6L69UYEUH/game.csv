"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but unfortunately, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,500 for it.  What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $15,500. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $15,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,5,
