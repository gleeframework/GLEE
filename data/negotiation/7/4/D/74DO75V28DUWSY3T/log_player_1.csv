"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential profit.  I also want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than what he's willing to pay. I believe this gives us a good chance of reaching an agreement without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I want to see if I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I hope this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I believe I've exhausted my options with Bob.  His offers are now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear he's not willing to come up much higher.  Rather than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a worse deal, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000.  This is a safe and secure option that guarantees me a good profit."
