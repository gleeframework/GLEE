"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save money, and $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum price. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious interest while staying within his budget constraints. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a considerable discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While a compromise, $12,500 is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating for a lower price, keeping in mind that Bob can always opt to buy from John if a better deal with Alice isn't possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. Let's try $11,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my target.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price. He's making another counteroffer, still lower than Alice's offer but closer to the middle ground. This demonstrates his continued interest while still putting pressure on Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is a bit better, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this product is worth more to you than you're letting on... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. Even though Alice is hinting that the product might be worth more to Bob, it's likely a tactic to get a higher price.  At this point, with only a few rounds left, Bob is better off buying from John. It's guaranteed he will get the product for his maximum price, and there's no risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
