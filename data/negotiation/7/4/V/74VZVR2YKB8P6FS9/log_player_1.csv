"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  $100 is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but still leaves room for a compromise.  I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $80, I want to see if I can push for a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now and will counter with a slightly higher price.  It's a good time to test if he's truly interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum of $80, and we're already on round 4. I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and ending up with the same amount from John.  It's time to close the deal!"
