"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a significant profit margin.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This still allows you to make a profit, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
