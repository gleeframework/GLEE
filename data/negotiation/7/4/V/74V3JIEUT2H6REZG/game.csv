"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself!",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it!",725000.0,Alice,5,
