Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product. This framing helps justify the high asking price.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still secure a deal significantly above your minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you prioritize a guaranteed sale over maximizing profit, you might propose a price closer to $1,000,000."
