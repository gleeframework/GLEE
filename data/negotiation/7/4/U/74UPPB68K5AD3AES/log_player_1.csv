You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer is exactly at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
