{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I won't go below $120, starting with $119 gives the impression of a deal and leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate (though I'll ultimately reject anything below $120). 
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting ""value"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might initially think, potentially making the $119 more appealing."
