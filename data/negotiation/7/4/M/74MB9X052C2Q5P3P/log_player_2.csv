# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000. This is still above my ideal price of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's significantly cheaper than buying from John, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity altogether."
