Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get a higher price, $850,000 is still a good profit and significantly above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
