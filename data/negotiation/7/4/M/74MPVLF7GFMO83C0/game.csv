"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and it allows me to get a good price for something that's very valuable to me.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, given its value to me and the fact that you're also getting a solid profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my desired price.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
