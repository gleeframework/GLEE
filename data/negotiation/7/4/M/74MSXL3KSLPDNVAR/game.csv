"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to accept a price significantly lower than that. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a lower price. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This aligns more closely with my valuation of the product and would allow me to make the purchase within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This would still give you a great price and would be fair for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
