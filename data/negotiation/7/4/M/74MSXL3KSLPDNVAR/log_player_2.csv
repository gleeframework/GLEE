Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This would still give you a great price and would be fair for both of us. What do you think?
