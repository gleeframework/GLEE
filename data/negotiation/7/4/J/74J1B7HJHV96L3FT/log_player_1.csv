Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with that number. I'll try to push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
