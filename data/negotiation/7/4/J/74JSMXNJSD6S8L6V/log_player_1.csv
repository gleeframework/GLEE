Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,400,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers you will quickly exceed your initial outlay.  I understand you have a specific price in mind, but I'm confident this offer represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still lower than my guaranteed fallback price of $1,500,000 with John. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as an opportunity and highlighting the potential value for Bob. I acknowledge his price point but emphasize that my offer is fair. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** By setting the price higher than Bob's perceived value, I have a chance to secure a better price than my guaranteed offer.
* **Maintain a good relationship with Bob:** By acknowledging his price point and emphasizing fairness, I aim to leave the door open for future negotiations if Bob rejects this offer."
