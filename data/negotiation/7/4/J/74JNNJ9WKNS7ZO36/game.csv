"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's potential. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,000,000. Can you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference:  $950,000.  This price recognizes the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, which I think is a fair compromise. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $920,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price to truly reflect the product's value. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $935,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  Let's close this deal!",935000.0,Alice,7,
