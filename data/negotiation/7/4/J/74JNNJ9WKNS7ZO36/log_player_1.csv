Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4

I've had 8 rounds of negotiations with Bob, and we haven't been able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory to me.  I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident that I can get a price closer to my desired value with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
