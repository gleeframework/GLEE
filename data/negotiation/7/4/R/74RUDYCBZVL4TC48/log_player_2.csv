"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, showing he's serious about negotiating. This counteroffer is a good starting point, leaving room for compromise while still keeping the price well below his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is a fair price considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a step closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay.  He's already established his willingness to negotiate and shouldn't be pressured by Alice's ""fair price"" argument.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiations, but showing flexibility. He's moved slightly closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating his interest in reaching an agreement.  He's still offering a price that's significantly lower than his maximum budget, and he believes there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more."
