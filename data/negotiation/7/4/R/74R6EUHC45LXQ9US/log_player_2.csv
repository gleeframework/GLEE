# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's best to reject and see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
