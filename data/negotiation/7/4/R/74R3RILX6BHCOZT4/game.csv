"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this excellent product. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, so I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal work.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to consider that, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand this product's value is significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
