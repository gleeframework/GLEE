"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and highly valuable product to you. This product holds immense significance and worth to me, reflecting its exceptional quality and utility. Given its importance to me, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us, considering the value you perceive in the product at $8,000. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than its value to her, it's significantly more than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice or stick with buying from John."
