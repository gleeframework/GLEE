"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. It's a great product, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering I'm prepared to buy right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're eager to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500, but I think you'll find it's worth it to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
