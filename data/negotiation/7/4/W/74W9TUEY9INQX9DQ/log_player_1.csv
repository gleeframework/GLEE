"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This will give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $855,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Let's compromise at $865,000. It's a good balance between our desired prices."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $845,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm concerned about further negotiation. I've already rejected several offers, and there's a risk that Bob might refuse any further counteroffers. With only a few rounds left, it's safer to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $800,000."
