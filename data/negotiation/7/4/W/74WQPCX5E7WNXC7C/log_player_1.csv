Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $9,500 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($10,000), giving him room to potentially negotiate.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately reaching a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. 

* **You have leverage:** Bob is already showing interest, indicating he's willing to pay more than your fallback price with John.
* **There's room for a compromise:** A counteroffer allows you to potentially meet Bob halfway at a price closer to your ideal $9,500. 

By rejecting, you keep the negotiation going and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're close on price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows willingness to compromise while still getting closer to your desired price.
* **Fairness:**  It's a reasonable midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Clear communication:** The message emphasizes the benefits for both parties, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $8,750 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, potentially pushing you closer to your fallback option with John.
* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations can take time, and you might be better off securing a sale now, even if it's slightly below your ideal price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that's not significantly less than what you could get from John."
