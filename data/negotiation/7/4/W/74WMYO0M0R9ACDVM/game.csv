"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for both of us to make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
