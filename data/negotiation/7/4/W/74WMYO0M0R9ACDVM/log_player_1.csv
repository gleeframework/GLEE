"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum ($1,800,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Open Communication:** The message keeps the tone positive and encourages a dialogue, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.

This strategy is about maximizing potential profit while leaving space for negotiation. I'm prepared to adjust in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for both of us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss.  I'll aim to bring him closer to my range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price ($200,000 decrease) to demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding firm well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. The goal is to signal that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate and won't settle for a low price.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reminding Bob of its worth and providing a rationale for my counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while pushing Bob towards a more agreeable price point.  I'm ready to adjust my approach based on his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for a higher amount, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move much further. Accepting now guarantees I make a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
