"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something I'm confident you'd find useful and would be willing to pay a premium for. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a lower price.",12000.0,Alice,1,
