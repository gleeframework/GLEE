"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something I'm confident you'd find useful and would be willing to pay a premium for. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
