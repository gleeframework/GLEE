"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
