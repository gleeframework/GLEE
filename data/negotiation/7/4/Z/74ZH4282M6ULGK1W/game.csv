"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This would give you a great deal on the product, and it's still a good price for me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
