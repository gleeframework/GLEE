"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and a great value for you.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to what I need.  To be honest, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, as a final offer. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and my previous offer of $10,500. How about $10,650?",10650.0,Bob,6,
