Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,600,000. This allows for a good profit margin for me while still offering you a significant value.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price based on the value of the product to me.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
