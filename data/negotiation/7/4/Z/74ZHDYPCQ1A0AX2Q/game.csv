"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,600,000. This allows for a good profit margin for me while still offering you a significant value.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price based on the value of the product to me.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
