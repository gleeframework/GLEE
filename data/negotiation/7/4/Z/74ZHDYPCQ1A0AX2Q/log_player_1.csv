"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,600,000. This allows for a good profit margin for me while still offering you a significant value.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price based on the value of the product to me.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as John's offer. I'm happy to accept this deal, as it's the best price I've received so far."
