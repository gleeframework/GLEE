"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm glad you think it's a game-changer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget of $1500000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1500000.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident that this price still represents a great value for you, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
