"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time and I'm confident it would be a fantastic asset for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than what it's worth to you. This is a one-time opportunity, so please let me know your decision. If you're not interested, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
