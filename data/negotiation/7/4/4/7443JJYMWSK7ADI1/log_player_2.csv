"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you, given its worth of $10000 to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $11000. I believe this price strikes a balance between the value you see in the product and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. While it's not the absolute lowest price Bob could get, it's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and is closer to Bob's desired price. Buying from John for $10,000 might seem ideal, but the risk of negotiation failing with Alice and then being stuck with John's price is a factor. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and still saves Bob money."
