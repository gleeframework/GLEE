"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,125,000 is getting closer, I'm still going to need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500?  I believe this is a fair price that recognizes both of our needs.",1112500.0,Bob,6,
