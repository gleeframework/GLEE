"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your vision.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Near Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  By starting near this value, we increase the chances of him accepting quickly. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue and aims to understand Bob's perspective, setting a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am looking to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is good, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,400,000. We're not in a rush and selling to John for $1,200,000 would be leaving a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  After carefully considering the product's value, I could come down to $1,410,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1410000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, we're not dropping our price too drastically. We're still aiming for a price above the midpoint between our initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, we're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying our counteroffer."
