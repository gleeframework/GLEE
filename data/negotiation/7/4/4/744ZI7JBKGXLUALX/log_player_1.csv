Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

While $1,075,000 is closer to my ideal price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
