"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of rejecting her offer and having to pay $15,000 to John is too high. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
