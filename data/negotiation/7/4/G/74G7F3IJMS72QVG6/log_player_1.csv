Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to my own valuation as possible.  
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below my minimum ($150) might entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to go below $150.

**Why this approach?**

This message aims to create a sense of urgency (""limited time"") while still leaving me a profit margin. By pricing it at $149, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept, considering he gains $50 in value ($150 - $100)."
