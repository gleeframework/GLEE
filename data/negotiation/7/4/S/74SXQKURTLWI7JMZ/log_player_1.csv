Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $10,000 price point allows for some flexibility during the negotiation process.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, suggesting a potential benefit beyond his initial assessment.

This initial offer positions me favorably for the negotiation, aiming for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it still falls significantly short. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's potential to get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially push for a price closer to my target.

I'm confident I can achieve a better price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While I value our conversation, $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still allows me to make a profit while offering you a fair price. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering to increase the price:**  I'm proposing a price of $9,500, which is closer to my target and still offers Bob a better deal than his initial offer. 
* **Finality:**  I'm stating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Staying above minimum:**  My offer is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I get a profitable deal.

This counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground, pushing Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining my position and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
