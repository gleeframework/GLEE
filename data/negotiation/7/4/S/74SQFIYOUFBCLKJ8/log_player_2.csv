# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. We believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you at a price of $1,100,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,050,000? I believe this price is reasonable and represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, we're willing to make another concession. We're offering the product to you at a price of $1,075,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and we're willing to meet you at this price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is now higher.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, achieving Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible."
