# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $25000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value you're highlighting, $25,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering its value and the potential it holds. What do you think?

```

While Alice has lowered her price, $18,000 is still above your budget. You have 7 rounds remaining to negotiate a better price.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price, as there's still potential to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this product holds value, and I'm eager to acquire it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer directly targets your maximum budget, showing that you are serious about purchasing the product but won't go any higher. It puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer and your maximum budget.  It demonstrates your continued willingness to negotiate while still staying within your price range. This could potentially push Alice to make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we try $15500? It's still a compromise, but it's a price that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, $15,500 is still more than you are willing to pay. You have 3 rounds left to negotiate a better price. You are still in a good position to negotiate a lower price, as you can still threaten to buy from John for $12,000. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, as there's still potential to save money. You're likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $15,500 is still outside my budget. Let's try $13,000. It's a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product. We're getting close, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's current offer. It shows you are still willing to negotiate but are firm on your price limit. This could potentially pressure Alice to make a final concession and accept your offer, as you only have two rounds left before you can buy from John."
