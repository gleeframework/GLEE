"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my financial reach.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects both the product's true worth and our willingness to work together.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. To be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum for this product given its value.  However, because I see the potential in our partnership, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably spend. I'm ready to pay $975,000 for this product. This is a significant offer for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. It's important to me that we find a price that works for both of us.
