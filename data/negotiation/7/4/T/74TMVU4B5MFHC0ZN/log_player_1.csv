Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to allow room for bargaining. This leaves Bob space to feel like he can negotiate you down.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to start high, going too close to $1,200,000 might immediately scare Bob off. $1,100,000 is a strong starting point that still allows for negotiation but signals the product's significant value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's input, fostering a more collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my financial reach.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between his offer and our asking price, suggesting there's room for negotiation. We can try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of selling to John for our minimum price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects both the product's true worth and our willingness to work together.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, But Not Too Much:** We're making a counteroffer of $1,050,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm above our absolute bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The language emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, promoting a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 remains below our absolute minimum of $1,200,000. While he is moving closer, we need to see more significant progress.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's negotiation tactics suggest he is willing to pay more than his initial offer. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price, potentially pushing him closer to our range.
* **John as Safety Net:** We still have the option to sell to John at our desired price. This allows us to negotiate firmly with Bob without the fear of losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. To be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum for this product given its value.  However, because I see the potential in our partnership, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to be more decisive.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial final concession to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility but still holds above our absolute bottom line.
* **Justification and Partnership:**  We clearly explain the reasoning behind our minimum price while emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Call to Action:**  The message concludes with a clear call to action, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably spend. I'm ready to pay $975,000 for this product. This is a significant offer for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. It's important to me that we find a price that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob has been consistently unwilling to move substantially closer to our minimum price, even after we made a significant final concession. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob has an opportunity cost. We risk losing the guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.
* **Secure the Best Deal:** John's offer provides us with the full value we place on the product and eliminates further negotiation risks. 

It's time to move on from Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
