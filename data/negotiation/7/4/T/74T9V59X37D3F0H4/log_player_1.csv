"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an ambitious opening offer, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm aiming to understand Bob's potential interest and gauge his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired range, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely. It's important to be flexible in negotiations and recognize when a deal is good enough."
