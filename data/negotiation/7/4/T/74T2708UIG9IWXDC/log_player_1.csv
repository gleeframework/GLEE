Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob can encourage him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low: I'll either counter with a slightly lower price or switch to John who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working with a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum, but I'm aiming for a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has acknowledged the value of the product and is willing to pay something. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially meeting him halfway at $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and that this is a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone can help keep the negotiation productive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If his counteroffer is too low or if it seems like he's not willing to compromise, I'll likely sell the product to John for $15,000."
