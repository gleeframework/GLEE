"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate. Alice's starting price is closer to my upper limit ($12,000) than her lower limit ($8,000). There's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to her lower limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance I can get it lower than $8,500."

""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but how about we settle at $8,000?"",

I'm aiming for $8,000, knowing Alice might counter slightly above her lowest acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a good deal."
