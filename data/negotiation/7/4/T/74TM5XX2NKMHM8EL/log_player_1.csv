Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This makes the offer attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have space to go lower while still exceeding your minimum.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, so be prepared to negotiate strategically and don't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept and get a deal done quickly, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. 

You can counteroffer with a price closer to your original offer, or explore a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but how about we settle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, and you can't get a better deal with him.  While selling to John would be just as profitable, accepting Bob's offer is a faster solution and secures the sale."
