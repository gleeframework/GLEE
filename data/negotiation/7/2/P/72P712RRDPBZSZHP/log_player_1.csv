"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with an offer of $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, we can start lowering the price gradually in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you making an offer.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still below my original asking price.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  I've already rejected his lower offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.  It's best to accept and close the deal."
