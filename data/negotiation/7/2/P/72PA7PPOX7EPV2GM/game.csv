"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
