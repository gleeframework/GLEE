"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$70 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum value. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to sell to John for the same price. I hope Bob will see the value in my product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more profitable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $110.  This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob. I'm getting closer to the point where I might have to sell to John, but I'm going to try one more time to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to get me a better price.  I've already lowered my price significantly and Bob doesn't seem willing to budge much. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is still a decent price."
