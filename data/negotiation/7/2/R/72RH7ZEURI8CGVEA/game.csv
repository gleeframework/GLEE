"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to reaching a decision, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
