"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an innovative solution designed to streamline processes and significantly enhance efficiency in your operations. Given its unique features and potential impact on your business, we believe it's worth more than its face value of $1200000. However, to facilitate a fair negotiation, I propose an initial offer of $1500000. This reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also the strategic benefits it could bring to your company. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for presenting your product, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am interested in purchasing the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
