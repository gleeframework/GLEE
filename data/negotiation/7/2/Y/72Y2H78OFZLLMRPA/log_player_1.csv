Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy from Alice instead of rejecting the offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $11,999 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less willing to negotiate.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a single-offer scenario, a slightly lower price leaves a small window open in case Bob wants to negotiate, potentially leading to a faster sale."
