"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer and close to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation."
