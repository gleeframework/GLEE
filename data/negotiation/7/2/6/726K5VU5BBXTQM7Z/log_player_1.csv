Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $8,000, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while also establishing a fair starting point for the negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a good price:**  The initial offer is high enough to potentially get a good price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** By starting with a fair offer and a friendly message, I'm hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  

My next counteroffer will likely be somewhere between $8,000 and $9,000, taking into consideration Bob's budget limitations and my own minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,500, which is above Bob's offer of $7,000 but below my initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer as a compromise.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a lower price, I'm showing flexibility and signaling my willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still above Bob's maximum budget, giving him a reason to consider my offer. 

This approach aims to:

* **Find a compromise:** By bridging the gap between our offers, I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By showing willingness to negotiate, I'm aiming to keep Bob interested in the product.
* **Maintain my bargaining power:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,250. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's getting close.  Considering the possibility of having to sell to John for $12,000, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. 

This decision is based on a few factors:

* **Potential profit:** While $8,250 is less than my ideal price, it's still a substantial profit considering my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll counteroffer again, and I might have to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time factor:** Continuing the negotiation could take longer, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach an agreement. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and earning a good profit, while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
