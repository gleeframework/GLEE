I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This price is higher than my guaranteed sale price to John, so it gives me the potential to earn more. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, there's a chance he might reject the offer. But if he does, I can still sell to John and ensure I get at least $12,000."
