"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.
* **It sets the stage for negotiation:**  This initial offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly less than your initial offer. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter-offer and try to get closer to your desired price. You have 8 more rounds to negotiate before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but how about $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,500? That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is lower than your ideal price, it's still a good deal considering:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000.
* **You've reached a compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you've met him halfway with your counteroffer. 
* **Limited time:** You have 6 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate may not result in a significantly higher price, especially if Bob is truly at his limit. 

It's better to secure the sale at a good price than risk a stalemate or a lower offer from John."
