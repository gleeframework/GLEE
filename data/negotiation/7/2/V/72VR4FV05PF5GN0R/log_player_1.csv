"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not yet ready to settle for that.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm dropping my price slightly, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I believe we can find a deal within this range."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price again, showing flexibility.  At this point, we are very close to my minimum price. If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John, but I want to see if we can reach an agreement with Bob."

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept this offer."
