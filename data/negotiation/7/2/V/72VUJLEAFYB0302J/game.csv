,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $102.50 for it. Can you consider my offer?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting a bit frustrated here. We're so close to a deal.  I'll come down to $107.50.  This is my final offer. If you don't take it, I'm going to have to sell to someone else.",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102.50 and $107.50. I'll offer $105. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,8,
