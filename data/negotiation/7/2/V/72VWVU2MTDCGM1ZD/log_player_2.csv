Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 out of this to make it worthwhile.  Do you think you could do that?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down significantly in price. While we could try to haggle further, $10,900 is a good deal and saves us $1,100 compared to John's offer. It's better to secure a good price now than risk the negotiation going south in later rounds."
