"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$120 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to get closer to his $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's limit, he can still potentially do better. There are several rounds remaining, and he can continue to negotiate with Alice to try and reach a more favorable price. It's worth continuing to explore options with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. Offering $110 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price. This counteroffer keeps the deal moving forward without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is getting very close to Bob's limit, there's still room for improvement. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and Bob has several rounds left to try and squeeze out a lower price.  He can likely get a deal closer to his $150 limit by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum price of $150 and only has four rounds left. This counteroffer is a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's latest offer.  It signals his willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a favorable price.  If Alice accepts, Bob will get the product within his limit and secure a decent deal.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have to make a decision on whether to continue negotiating or switch to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is very close to Bob's limit and only three rounds remain,  he is still $5 away from his target price. There's still potential to negotiate further. If Alice rejects his counteroffer, Bob can potentially close the deal at $150 with John, but it's worth trying to get a slightly lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get the product below his $150 limit. Offering $135 is a significant compromise, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. There are only two rounds left, and Bob needs to get a deal done.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have to purchase from John at $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal with Alice.  While he's only $10 below his target price, there's only one round left. Accepting Alice's offer at $140 is the best course of action. It ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially paying $150 to John."
