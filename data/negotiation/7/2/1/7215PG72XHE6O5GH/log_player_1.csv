{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $15,000, which is above my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm open to negotiation, I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, which could make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm not just stating a price; I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This could make him more willing to pay a higher price.

**Remember:** This is just the first step. I'll need to assess Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This means there's no room for me to gain more by accepting it. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This could prompt him to come up with a higher counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** I can afford to wait and see if Bob is willing to increase his bid. Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, so I don't need to rush. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, taking into account the possibility that he might walk away if I'm too stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implying that he's getting a good deal even at $13,500.
* **Flexibility:** By saying ""I'm willing to be flexible,"" I leave room for further negotiation without committing to $13,500.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's reaction. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another offer or accept John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. How about we try $12800? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,800 is just $800 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a relatively small difference considering the potential to make a deal.
* **Time is a Factor:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and while I could continue to try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob could lose interest entirely.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit. It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal completely. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to my next opportunity."
