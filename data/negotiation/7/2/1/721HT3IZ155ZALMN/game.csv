"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which I believe is still a fair price given the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $14000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15500. This is a fair price, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $15500. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,13500.0,Bob,6,
