Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  I've chosen to start with $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Potential for a Deal:** Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation, especially if he sees the value I'm emphasizing. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), it's still significantly lower.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position and potentially secure a higher price. I can use my next counteroffer to bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John is always an option, I still believe there's room for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Move:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,500 is a good starting point, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,250 for the product. This price reflects the value I know you'll find in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've lowered my price to $11,250, which is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500).
* **Message:** I've emphasized the value Bob will find in the product and highlighted that this price is a ""middle ground"", which can make it more appealing to him.

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise and helps to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Still Profitable:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and allows me to achieve a good profit.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and avoids making a hasty decision to sell to John."
