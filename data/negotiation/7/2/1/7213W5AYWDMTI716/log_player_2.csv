"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,500 is a good starting point, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,250 for the product. This price reflects the value I know you'll find in it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, as this guarantees him the lowest price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
