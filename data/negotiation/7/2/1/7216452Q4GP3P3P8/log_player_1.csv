Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still profit if Bob accepts.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This avoids alienating Bob with an overly aggressive offer.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and how confident you are in securing a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Here's why I'm rejecting Bob's offer:

* **My minimum:** My goal is to make at least $10,000. Bob's offer is below that threshold.
* **Negotiation space:**  Even though Bob's offer is close, I can potentially push for a higher price by countering. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept a lower offer. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to close the gap. It's crucial to remain firm, but also open to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would still represent a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $9,250 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain profit:** This price still allows me to earn more than Bob's initial offer and is closer to my desired profit.
* **Be reasonable:**  I'm not pushing for a price that's outlandishly high, which could make Bob walk away. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand your position, but I must stick to my limit of $8,500 for this purchase. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Little room for negotiation:**  There's not much wiggle room left to negotiate with Bob.  He's already stated his firm limit.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired profit without any further hassle or uncertainty. 

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, it's not worth risking my profits for the sake of a potentially lengthy and unsuccessful negotiation.  John offers a reliable and profitable option."
