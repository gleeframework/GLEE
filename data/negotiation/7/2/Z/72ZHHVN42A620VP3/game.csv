"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. Let's settle on $1,125,000. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that we're close, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, $1,050,000. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll be happy to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
