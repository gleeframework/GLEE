{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not going all in with my minimum asking price. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can confidently push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly below my desired value.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still room to negotiate.  Bob is clearly interested, and I can likely get a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.  

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Value for Bob:**  $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his value of $1,000,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm staying above my minimum, reminding Bob that I have other options if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, but it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm holding onto John's offer of $1,500,000, giving me a strong position to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

**Next Step:** I will make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, while keeping Bob's budget in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. Let's settle on $1,125,000. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Stronger Position:**  I'm staying above my minimum and leveraging John's offer to maintain a stronger negotiating position.
* **Fair Deal for Bob:**  $1,125,000 is still a good value for Bob, considering his perceived value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we're close, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, $1,050,000. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll be happy to close the deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than Bob's best offer. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate where we both refuse to budge.  This could lead to me getting a lower price or losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to take John's offer and guarantee myself a much higher profit than I'm likely to get from Bob at this point."
