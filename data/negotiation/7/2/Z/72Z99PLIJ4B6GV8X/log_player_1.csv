"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and presenting the offer as a ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message explicitly invites Bob to respond, making it clear I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $900000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially close the deal with John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still be a great value for you and allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving halfway towards Bob's offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the ""great value"" Bob would still be getting at this price, which could be a good motivator.
* **Open Dialogue:**  I use a friendly tone and ask for Bob's opinion, keeping the lines of communication open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $925000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not yet ready to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'm hoping to continue negotiating with Bob to reach a price closer to my desired range. However, I also need to consider the time constraint and the potential of selling to John for a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 still falls a bit short of what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident that the value of this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to offer one final compromise - $975,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm emphasizing that this is my ""final compromise,"" indicating I'm nearing my limit, but also suggesting flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value and the potential for exceeding expectations. 
* **Win-Win Approach:** I frame this as a ""fair price that benefits both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of a balanced outcome.
* **Closing Push:** I'm adding a sense of urgency with the ""let's close this deal"" phrase to encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to pay $950000 for your product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 6 and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000, I'm confident that selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
