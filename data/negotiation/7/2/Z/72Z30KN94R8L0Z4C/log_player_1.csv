I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit beyond my minimum of $120."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$80 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm going to lower my price to $110, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
