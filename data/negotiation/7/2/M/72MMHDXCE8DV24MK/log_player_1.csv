Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar for less. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. Let's split the difference - how about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to stick to my original budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $110 is a decent price, and I'm not sure I can get much better in the remaining rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $100."
