"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us, given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $175 is above your maximum budget of $150. While you want to save money, you're willing to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($120 vs. $175), I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will indicate how much she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, there's space to increase my price gradually towards a compromise. 

It's a starting point in the negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer of $140, you can try to push the price closer to $120. You're willing to go through another round of negotiation before resorting to buying from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  That's a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** By suggesting $130, I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between her last offer ($140) and my previous counteroffer ($120). 
* **Framing it positively:**  I'm presenting this counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" to encourage Alice to agree.
* **Strategic positioning:** If she rejects this offer, I'm still within my budget to go up slightly and still get a better price than buying from John ($150)."
