"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit steep for you, but $600000 is quite a stretch from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $750000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $675000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both find a win in this deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $675000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a price of $725000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
