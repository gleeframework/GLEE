Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value and the product's value to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still staying above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob, his latest offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum. However, with John offering $1,000,000, it's the safer and more reliable option. I'll sell to John to ensure I meet my minimum goal."
