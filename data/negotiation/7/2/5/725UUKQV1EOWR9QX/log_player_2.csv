You're still better off trying to negotiate with Alice.  You're already close to your target price, and there's still room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you. You can save $3,000 compared to buying from John.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
