{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $150, but I also want to be ready to sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by Bob's offer of $100, it's far below what I know the product is worth.  There's still a chance I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds of counter-offers to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're looking for a lower price. However, $100 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay and closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit while also closing the deal with Bob."
