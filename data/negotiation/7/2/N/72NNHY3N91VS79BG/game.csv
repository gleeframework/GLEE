"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its market value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This reflects a considerable discount while still acknowledging the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
