Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategically sound option at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential for Bob to lower his offer or walk away. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **John as a Backup:** While I have John as a backup offer, there's no guarantee his offer remains open indefinitely. Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the risk of losing both opportunities."
