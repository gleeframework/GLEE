"Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to own a truly unique product.  While I value it highly, I'm open to negotiation. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its inherent worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has significant value beyond what you might be currently assessing. To move us closer, I'm proposing $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I see in it.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
