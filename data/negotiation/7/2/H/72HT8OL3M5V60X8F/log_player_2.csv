"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe has immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, I'm currently looking to spend around $1,000,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that price point?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. While $950,000 is still higher than my initial counteroffer, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price that's within my budget and potentially saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John. The risk of further negotiation could lead to a higher price, so it's more beneficial to accept Alice's current offer."
