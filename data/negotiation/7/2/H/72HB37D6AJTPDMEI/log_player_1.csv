"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high initial price and conveying its worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating this is an ""initial proposal,"" I signal my openness to negotiation and potential price adjustments.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is and provide insight into his negotiation style.
2. **Anchor High:**  Starting high sets a reference point that can lead to a more favorable final price, even after concessions. 
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on Bob's reaction and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about obtaining a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value.  While I understand your position, $950,000 falls short of what I consider a fair reflection of its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price acknowledges your interest while ensuring a reasonable return on a unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price ($100,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm (Above Minimum):** However, my counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This signals that I'm serious about obtaining a strong price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and positioning the lower price as a gesture of good faith. 
* **Objective Tone:**  The message remains professional and avoids any hint of desperation, reinforcing the idea that I have other options (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I can get a significantly better deal from Bob, especially considering:

* **Upward Trend:**  Bob's offers have been steadily increasing, showing his commitment to the purchase.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations incurs opportunity costs. Accepting now secures a substantial profit without risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Unknown Future:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds. He might even lower his offer, sensing hesitation.

Accepting $1,100,000 now ensures a significant profit and avoids potential risks associated with continued negotiation."
