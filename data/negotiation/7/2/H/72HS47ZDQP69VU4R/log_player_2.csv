"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has a lot of potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  There's significant room for negotiation, especially considering the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice.  Bob should reject the offer and counter-offer to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for the product. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, even though it's a bit higher than his initial counteroffer.  It's important to note:

* **Alice is willing to negotiate:**  This shows she's flexible and wants to make a deal.
* **The price is reasonable:** While Bob can try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and the risk of losing the deal to John is high.  
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that either Alice will walk away, or Bob will decide to buy from John. 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice for Bob, as it secures the product at a good price without risking a more expensive alternative."
