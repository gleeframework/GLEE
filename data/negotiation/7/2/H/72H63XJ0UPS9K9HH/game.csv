Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $150 and $120. I'll sell it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other interested buyers. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $130. I'd be willing to meet you at $127.50. Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting another offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $129. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away. What do you think?",129.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but $129 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'd be willing to meet you at $126. Can you consider that?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $128. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $125. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. Can you reconsider?",125.0,Bob,10,
