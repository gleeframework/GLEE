Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing we have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our ideal price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and accept our offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having John as a safety net to ensure we get at least $1,500,000 for the product."
