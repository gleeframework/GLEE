Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you still make a profit above your minimum of $80.
* **Friendly and inviting:** The message is casual and inviting, aiming to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond strategically based on his price and any potential insights into his value for the product. 
* I'll also keep John's offer of $80 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $80?  I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum selling price, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Gather information:**  His willingness to offer $80 gives me a better understanding of his potential value for the product. 
* **Potentially increase the price:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial $100 and see if he's willing to budge.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $80 and $100, depending on my assessment of Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'll also continue to keep John's $80 offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a margin:** $90 still ensures I make a profit above my minimum of $80.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my target.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away and sell to John."
