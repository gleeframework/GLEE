"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $120. How about we compromise at $160? I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit.",160.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting close to meeting you at $140, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.",145.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on that, I'll consider it a fair deal.",135.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, which would be $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,140.0
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $140. I think that's the lowest I can reasonably sell the product for. Let's try to meet at $140, and we can call it a deal.",140.0,Alice,9,,
