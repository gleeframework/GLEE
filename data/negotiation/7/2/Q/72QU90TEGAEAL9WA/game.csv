"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price and allows us both to get a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
