{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for the full $15,000 value to me. Bob may counter, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $15,000,  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is very close to my minimum value.  Selling to John would be a sure thing, but accepting this offer from Bob is a faster and more profitable transaction."
