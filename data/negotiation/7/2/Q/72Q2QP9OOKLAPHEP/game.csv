"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
