"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go down to $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his counteroffer.  He's still in a good position to try and negotiate further, as he has more rounds available. Rejecting this offer allows him to attempt to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would represent a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $11400. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,400 is getting closer to his preferred price, he still has more rounds to negotiate. There's still a possibility of getting a lower price, so he's better off rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,400 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $10,750. I think this price represents a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $11300. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process (only 3 rounds left).
* **Close to Target:**  $11,300 is only $300 above Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,750.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks ending up with no deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.  

While Bob might still prefer a slightly lower price, accepting this offer ensures he gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to buying from John."
