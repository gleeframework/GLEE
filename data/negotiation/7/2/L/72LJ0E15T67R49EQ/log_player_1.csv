{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Below Bob's value:** $9,500 is less than Bob's value of $10,000, making it potentially appealing to him.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth and potentially a better price for you. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,000 is your minimum, Bob is willing to pay more. There's potential for a better deal by rejecting his offer and countering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great price for such a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

While $7,500 is close to your minimum, you can potentially get more.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. Let's see if we can get closer to $8,000!"
