Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value of the product and presents the price as a ""great deal."" This aims to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product for $110.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.  If his offer is significantly lower than my minimum, I'll likely reject and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer. 
* **Stalemate:** If we reach a stalemate, I'll consider selling to John for $100. It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to balance that with the potential for a lost sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we set the product price at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $95 is higher than his perceived value ($80), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $110, but slightly lower to show flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $100 and $110. 
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll continue negotiating, but if the price drops too low, I'll consider selling to John to ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Flexibility:** The message emphasizes finding a ""compromise"" and uses the phrase ""still a great deal"" to reiterate the value of the product for Bob.
* **Price Justification:** I've included a reason for the price (covering my costs) to make my counteroffer seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've sold the product for $105.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter again, or sell to John. 
* **Selling to John:**  If we reach a stalemate and the price falls below $100, I'll sell to John to avoid losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $100. This would allow us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **No Further Upside:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price, and there's a risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a wasted opportunity, as selling to John at the same price ($100) is also an option.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation. It guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a lost sale."
