I'm increasing my offer to $13,000. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will get us closer to a deal.  I'm getting closer to my budget, and I'm feeling confident about getting this product at a good price."

With only one round left, it seems unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price from Alice. It's time to secure the product by buying it from John for $12,000. It's within my budget and guarantees I won't miss out on the product."
