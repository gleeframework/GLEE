"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal target.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further. There are still several rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $142 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $136.  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 136}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than that. How about $139? It's a small step up from $136, but it's worth it to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate further. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially get the price down to $135 or even $130.  He's not quite ready to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $139 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $137?  This would allow us both to close the deal and be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 137}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $137. How about $138? It's a small step up, but it's worth it to me. Let's see if we can get to a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is only $3 above Bob's desired price of $135. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. Alice seems firm in her stance.  Bob has only three rounds left, and buying from John would cost $12 more.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible option, as it saves Bob some money and allows him to get the product."
