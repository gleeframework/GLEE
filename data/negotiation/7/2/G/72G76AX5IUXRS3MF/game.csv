"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get the product for closer to $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1075000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1050000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1062500?  This would split the difference between our last two offers.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 1062500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.
