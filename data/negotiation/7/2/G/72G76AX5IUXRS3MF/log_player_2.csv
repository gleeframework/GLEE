Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 1062500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product for 1081250. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,081,250.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $1,081,250 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of a deal falling through or running out of rounds."
