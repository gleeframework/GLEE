Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. $10,250 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $10,400? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 10400}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
