"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product to both parties, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still reflecting the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $875,000? I think this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. To further facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $890,000 for the product. This still reflects its value to you, while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",890000.0,Alice,5,
