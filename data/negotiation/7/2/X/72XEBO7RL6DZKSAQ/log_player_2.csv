Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$135 is still higher than John's price. Keep negotiating with Alice, as you're still closer to John's price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $135 is closer, but still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
