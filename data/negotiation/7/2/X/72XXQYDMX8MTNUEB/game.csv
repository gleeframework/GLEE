"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,150,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've estimated its worth at $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have a backup buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
