"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,150,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've estimated its worth at $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have a backup buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Alice's offer is higher than her valuation of $1,000,000, it's still lower than the $1,200,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Saving money is the goal:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John."
