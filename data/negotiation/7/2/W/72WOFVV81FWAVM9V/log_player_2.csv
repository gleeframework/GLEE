"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite and frame the counteroffer as reasonable, even though it's quite a bit lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Goal in Mind:**  My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to my maximum budget of $80. However, starting too close to $80 might not leave much room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Would you consider $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved down quite a bit, which is a positive sign. It indicates she's willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation, potentially getting the price closer to my $80 limit. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup option provides a safety net. If negotiations with Alice don't reach a satisfactory price, I can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  This counteroffer is direct and states my absolute maximum price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying it's ""the highest I can go"", I'm creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, Alice might be aware that I have other options.  This knowledge could encourage her to accept my offer. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** If Alice accepts, I get the product at my target price. If she rejects it, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $80 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $120?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Alice went back up in price, signaling she's unlikely to accept anything close to my $80 limit.  
* **Time to Move On:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a significant price drop. It's time to exercise my backup option.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees the product at my target price of $80."
