{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit further.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I could aim higher, getting closer to $1,500,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. $1,350,000 is a strong starting point that heavily favors me while still being appealing to Bob. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to aim higher with Bob."
