Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is higher than his valuation of $800,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation and still allows me to earn more than I would from selling to John. 

Here's why this strategy is optimal:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Selling to Bob for $900,000 gives me a higher profit than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation, I create a situation where he has to decide if the extra value is worth the extra cost. 
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing my minimum desired profit.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to ensure a successful sale."
