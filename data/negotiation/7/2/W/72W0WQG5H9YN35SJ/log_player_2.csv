"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is lower than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower, and you can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
