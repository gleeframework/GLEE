"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree this product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to settle at that?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
