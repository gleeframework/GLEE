# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

At $825,000, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting now secures a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal."
