"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $95.  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $102? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
