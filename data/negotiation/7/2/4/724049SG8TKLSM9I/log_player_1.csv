Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $11,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product while leaving space for Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, we establish a negotiation point. 
* This approach gives us room to potentially lower the price if necessary, while also maximizing our chances of getting a good deal.
* Keeping the door open to John as a backup option keeps us from being pressured to accept a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below our minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** 
* **We have a backup option with John, who is willing to pay our minimum.**

**Strategy:**

* It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to our desired price. 
* We can use John as leverage in negotiations to push Bob to a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our conversation, $10,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** We're offering $11,000, which is a compromise halfway between our previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** The message is still positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also reiterates our willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* We're trying to find a middle ground to increase our chances of a deal while still maintaining a price that's above our minimum.
*  By emphasizing the value for Bob, we're aiming to persuade him to accept this counteroffer."
