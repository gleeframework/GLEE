"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,200 is still significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision.",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $8,400 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $8,300, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8300.0,Bob,6,
