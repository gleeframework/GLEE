"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  I know it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move the deal forward. Let's meet at $12,500. It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,500 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. He can still get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. Let's meet at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still above Bob's budget, even with her ""concession"" to $12,000.  Since Bob has already been negotiating for several rounds and has a clear alternative with John, he should cut his losses and buy from John for $10,000.  Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to get him to his target price."
