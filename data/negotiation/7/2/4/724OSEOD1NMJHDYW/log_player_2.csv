**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000. This saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's still a good deal for Alice:** Alice values the product at $800,000, so she makes a profit of $300,000 by selling it to you."
