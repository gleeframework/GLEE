"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $14,000? That would be a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
