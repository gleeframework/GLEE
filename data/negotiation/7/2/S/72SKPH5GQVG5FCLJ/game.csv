"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little further in the middle at $11,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,200 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. This price allows for a fair profit for you and a reasonable cost for me.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150.0,Alice,7,
