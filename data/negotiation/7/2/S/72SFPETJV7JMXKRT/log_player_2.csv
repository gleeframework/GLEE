"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is quite high, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $950000? This is a significant discount from its true potential value, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
