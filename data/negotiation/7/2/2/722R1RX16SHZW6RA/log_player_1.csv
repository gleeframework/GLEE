Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's lower than your minimum but still gives you a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still negotiate up if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It's a friendly approach:**  Starting with a positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can get a better deal.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,000? This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
