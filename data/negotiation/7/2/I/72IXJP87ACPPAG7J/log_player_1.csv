Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's within Bob's range:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It gives you a good profit:** You value the product at $1,000,000, so you're making a significant profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's still above your minimum value ($1,000,000), it's significantly lower than your initial offer ($1,400,000).  
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has expressed willingness to invest and is clearly interested in the product. This indicates there's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Avoiding settling too early:** Accepting Bob's offer now would mean leaving $200,000 on the table.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of my product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for you.  
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, you can still lower the price slightly, but this counteroffer keeps you in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to your initial counteroffer of $1,300,000.
* **Significant profit:** Accepting this offer still gives you a $250,000 profit, which is a substantial gain.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving you with only the $1,000,000 offer from John.

In this situation, it's wiser to accept Bob's offer and secure a profitable sale. The potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
