Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $9,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before it goes to someone else might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

By setting the initial price high but still potentially attractive to Bob, I increase the chances of maximizing my profit."
