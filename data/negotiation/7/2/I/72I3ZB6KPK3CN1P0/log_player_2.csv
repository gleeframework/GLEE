"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,350,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $150,000."
