Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which still reflects a strong value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $910,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point.  Let's split the difference and go with $880,000. This price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
