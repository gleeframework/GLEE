,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value this product can bring, I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be open to meeting me at this price?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking we could meet at $14500.

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm thinking we could meet at $14000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's benefits. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $13500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,9,
