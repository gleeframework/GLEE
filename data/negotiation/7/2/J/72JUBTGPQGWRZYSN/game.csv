"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,550,000.  This gives you a slight margin for potential future gains, and allows me to secure a price that reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
