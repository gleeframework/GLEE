"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is my final offer.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
