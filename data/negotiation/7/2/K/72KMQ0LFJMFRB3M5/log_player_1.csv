{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs, potentially worth far more to you in the long run. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** We know Bob values the product significantly higher than our minimum and John's offer. This allows us to aim high.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($1,500,000) makes it seem like a deal while still securing a substantial profit. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Creating a sense of urgency might prompt Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Why not higher?:**

* Going too close to $1,500,000 might raise suspicion or make Bob balk at the price, even if it's valuable to him. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, securing even a slightly higher price than John's offer significantly increases our potential earnings."
