"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
