# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a good deal in terms of Alice's perceived value, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
