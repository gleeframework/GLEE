"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you considering my interest.  While the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair given your value for the product and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground, but I can only go as high as $1,150,000. This price would allow us both to benefit from the deal and reach an agreeable outcome.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This price is closer to your maximum budget and still reflects the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but that's as low as I can go. This price still reflects the product's value to you and is a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
