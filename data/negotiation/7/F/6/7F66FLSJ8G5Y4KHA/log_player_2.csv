"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 is way above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no point in accepting this offer. I'll try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. It's better to continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  I still have room to negotiate and I don't want to miss out on potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,550,000? This would allow us both to achieve a reasonable outcome."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
