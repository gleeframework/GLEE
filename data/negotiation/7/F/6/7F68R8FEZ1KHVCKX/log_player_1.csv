Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $170, but I'm willing to let you have it for $165. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 165
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing our minimum acceptable price is $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $165 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable than his perceived value of $150.
* **Alternative Option:**  The message subtly reminds Bob that he's getting a priority offer, as we have another buyer lined up. This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines."
