"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product looks great, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go above $900,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900,000.
