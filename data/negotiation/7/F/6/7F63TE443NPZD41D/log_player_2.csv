"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not in your best interest to accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000. You have a better option with John at $800,000.  You can try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price, but ultimately, you should be prepared to walk away and buy from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product looks great, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can still get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go above $900,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $925,000, which is closer to your budget, but still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a better deal already in hand."
