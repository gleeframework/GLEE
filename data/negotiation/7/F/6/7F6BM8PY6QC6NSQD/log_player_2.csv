"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm asking for $1100000, a price that reflects both its value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to her valuation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your valuation and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1075000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is within your budget and closer to your desired price.  There's always a risk of further negotiation, but it's unlikely Alice will go much lower than this, given her valuation of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves you $25,000 compared to buying from John."
