"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your valuation and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1075000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
