Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,200,000.  Our goal is to see if Bob will pay more than this.
* **Find a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000) increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring the product is sold even if Bob declines."
