# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.

I'm thinking of a price of $950000, which is a $150000 discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still too high for me. I'm out of rounds and I need to get this product.  While it's a little disappointing not to get a lower price, I'm better off going with John. I've been negotiating in good faith and I can't risk the deal falling through."
