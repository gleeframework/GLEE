"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a price much lower than her original ask.  It leaves room for negotiation while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still emphasizing that I want a price closer to my budget. This counteroffer is still below Alice's latest offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my target. I believe there's still room to negotiate further, especially with 5 rounds left. I'm going to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time only by $100,000. This shows that I'm approaching my limit but am still willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a good compromise, especially with only four rounds left.  It's also a good strategy to test Alice's willingness to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $75,000 above my budget and I'm running out of rounds.  There's a chance she might not budge further, and I'm risking losing the deal altogether.  It's worth accepting her offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
