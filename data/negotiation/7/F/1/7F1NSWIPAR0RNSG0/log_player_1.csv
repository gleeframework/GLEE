"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. However, it's still a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm happy to accept $115.  It's better than selling to John for $100 and leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds."
