"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. While I can't disclose details about the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $2000000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a potentially game-changing asset. If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss the details further. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,
