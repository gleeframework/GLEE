"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to accept that offer.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I offer $11500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm only one round away from being able to sell to John for $12,000, which is a safer bet than risking a lower offer from Bob. I'll counteroffer one more time before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. I'll offer you the product for $12,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at this price. Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11750.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to counteroffer again, I'm only one round away from selling to John for $12,000. It's a risk to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's no guarantee he'll accept a higher offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
