Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I offer $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. I'll offer you the product for $12000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at this price. Let me know what you decide.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
