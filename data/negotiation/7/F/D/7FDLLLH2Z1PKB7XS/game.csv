"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential of this product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle this. I'm willing to come down to $887,500.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",887500.0,Alice,5,
