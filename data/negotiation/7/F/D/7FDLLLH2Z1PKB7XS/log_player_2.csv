"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential of this product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle this. I'm willing to come down to $887,500.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $887,500, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000. This price is within Bob's budget and allows him to save a substantial amount compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance for further negotiation, accepting the offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on a better deal by waiting for a lower price."
