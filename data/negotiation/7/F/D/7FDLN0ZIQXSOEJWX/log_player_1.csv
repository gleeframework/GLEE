Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It's possible he might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if the product is valuable to him. 
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John if Bob declines. This gives us leverage in negotiations."
