"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
