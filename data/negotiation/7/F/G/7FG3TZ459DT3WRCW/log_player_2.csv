# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,025,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I think $1,030,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go below that. I'm offering you a final counteroffer of $1,027,500. This is my last chance to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,027,500. 
You have three options:
