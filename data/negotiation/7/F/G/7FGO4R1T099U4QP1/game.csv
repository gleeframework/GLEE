"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. This is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
