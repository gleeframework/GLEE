**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for significantly less than $900,000.  There's a large gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, it's getting closer to your acceptable range. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's not guaranteed. Considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of Alice walking away, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic decision. You'll still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
