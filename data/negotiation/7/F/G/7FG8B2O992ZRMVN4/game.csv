"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  This price reflects the value it brings to my business, while still allowing for a fair profit for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $975,000. This price still reflects the value it brings to you, while also being a fair profit for me.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for you while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
