(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly sticking close to her value.  It's time to consider if the potential savings are worth the risk of continued negotiation. 

Let's analyze:

* **Alice's Latest Offer:** $1,025,000
* **John's Price:** $1,000,000
* **Potential Savings:** $25,000

**Decision:**  While saving $25,000 is nice, Alice seems firm. There's a chance she won't budge much, and we'd end up with John's price anyway.

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** It's better to secure the product at a known price than risk losing out on the deal and potentially paying even more if negotiations with Alice stall."
