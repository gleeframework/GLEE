"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm really looking to spend around $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm really hoping to close this deal and this is the best I can do.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $85 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $95 - that's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a great deal!",95.0,Alice,5,
