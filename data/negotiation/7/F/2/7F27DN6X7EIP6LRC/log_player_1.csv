"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Offer:** I'm highlighting the potential value for Bob and framing it as a ""great deal"" to make him more likely to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in further conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but still above Bob's offer. 
* **John is a Backup:** I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product.  That's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is fair. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob has shown some flexibility, I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case I can't get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see it as a positive solution.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking Bob a direct question to gauge his interest and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I believe $87 is a reasonable compromise for both of us. This allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:** Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're in Round 6, and the number of negotiation rounds is limited. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob within the remaining rounds.
* **John is a Secure Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my price expectations."
