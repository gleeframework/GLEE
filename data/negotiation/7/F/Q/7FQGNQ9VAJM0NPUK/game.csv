"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $850,000. This is a very good compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your target, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
