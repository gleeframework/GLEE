"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your flexibility.  I'm still not quite comfortable with $125. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  This way, we both get a fair deal.",127.5,Alice,5,
