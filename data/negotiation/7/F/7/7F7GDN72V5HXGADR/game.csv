"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and I'm sure it will be highly valuable for your business.  Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  How about we start at a significantly lower price, say $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I understand you have a budget to work with, but this product is truly valuable. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This still gives you a substantial saving while ensuring I can make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I've got another offer on the table that's significantly less than what you're proposing.  If you can come down to $950,000, we have a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but we're still not quite there. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to make sense for me. How about $1,025,000?  This is my final offer, otherwise I'll have to go with my other option.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is worth more to you than you're currently proposing. This is my final offer: $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit, while still giving you a valuable product at a reasonable cost. If you don't accept this offer, I'll be moving on to my other buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
