"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer $1,125,000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
