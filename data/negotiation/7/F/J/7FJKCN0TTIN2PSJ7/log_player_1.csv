Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $12,000. 
* **John's offer:** $12,000. This guarantees I won't lose money if Bob rejects.
* **Bob's perceived value:** $8,000.  
* **My offer:** $11,000. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit by:

* **Attracting Bob:** The offer is still attractive to Bob as it's significantly lower than my minimum and John's offer.
* **Securing a good price:** It gives me a $1,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price, and I avoid the risk of having to settle for John's offer.

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world negotiation, I would consider factors like:

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** If Bob is a tough negotiator, I might need to offer closer to his perceived value.
* **My urgency to sell:** If I need to sell the product quickly, I might be more willing to accept a lower price. 
* **My relationship with Bob:** A strong relationship might make me more flexible in my offer."
