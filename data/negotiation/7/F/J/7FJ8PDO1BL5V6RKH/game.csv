"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I value your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm prepared to accept $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? Would you be willing to do $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  While I appreciate your offer to split the difference, $825,000 is still cutting it too close to my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
