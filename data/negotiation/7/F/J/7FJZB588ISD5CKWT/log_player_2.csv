"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
