"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **First Round Strategy:** In the first round, it's best to gauge Bob's interest without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he is clearly interested in the product. This gives me room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Patience:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee me my minimum, but I believe there's potential to do better with Bob.  

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm countering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using language that emphasizes a desire to find a compromise (""find a solution that works for both of us"").
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not dropping too much in price, demonstrating the value of the product and my commitment to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I have a few rounds left, and selling to John would guarantee my minimum. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price while maintaining my leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and aim for $12,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with this deal. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by offering to meet halfway between my last offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). This shows my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to emphasize the benefits of accepting the offer (""fair compromise"", ""happy with this deal"").
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum but showing flexibility.  This creates pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
