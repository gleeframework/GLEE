"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and aim for $12,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with this deal. ",12500.0,Alice,5,
