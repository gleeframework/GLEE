Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, even exceeding the price I'm offering it to you for.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize our profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. He gets a $2,000 discount from the initial perceived value, while Alice still earns a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob would receive, potentially swaying his decision."
