"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for something closer to $12000.  It's a fantastic product with a lot of value, and I believe $12000 reflects that.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $12000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
