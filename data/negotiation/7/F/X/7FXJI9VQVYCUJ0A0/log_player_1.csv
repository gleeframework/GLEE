Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000.  It's a fantastic product with a lot of value, and I believe $12,000 reflects that.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $12000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
