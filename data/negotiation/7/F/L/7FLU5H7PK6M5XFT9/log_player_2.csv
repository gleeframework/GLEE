"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's offer of $120, but I can likely get a better price from Alice. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer to what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $90 for this great product. This still leaves a good margin for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's less than what I'm willing to pay John ($120) and closer to my ideal price. I'll take the deal and save some money."
