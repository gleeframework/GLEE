"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. Can we discuss the value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product. I'm proposing $1750000.  This takes into account your interest and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $2000000 to $1750000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1750000, so I'll offer $1475000. Can we discuss the value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1475000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1475000 and $1550000, so I'll offer $1512500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1512500.0,Bob,6,
