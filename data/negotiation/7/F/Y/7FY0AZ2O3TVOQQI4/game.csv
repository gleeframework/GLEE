"Bob, I appreciate our back and forth here, but I have to be honest, $1,225,000 is cutting it too close to what I can accept. This product has incredible potential, and I've already received significant interest from other buyers willing to meet my asking price. I'm open to making this work with you, but I need you to understand the value of what's on the table. Would you be willing to consider $1,260,000?  It's my final offer.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
