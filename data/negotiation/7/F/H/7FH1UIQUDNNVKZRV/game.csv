"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I can purchase the product from another seller for $1,000,000.  So that I don't have to pursue that option, would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your situation and the offer from the other seller. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell the product for $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",975000.0,Alice,5,
