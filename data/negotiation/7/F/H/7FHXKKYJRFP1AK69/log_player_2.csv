"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$80 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A price of $60 is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$75 is still a good price, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get it closer to my ideal price.  I'm confident that Alice wants to sell the product and will likely come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $72, which is a good price considering my budget. While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and I'd be left with having to buy from John at $150.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting nothing."
