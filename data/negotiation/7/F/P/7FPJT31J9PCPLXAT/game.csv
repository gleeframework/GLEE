"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,3,
