"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500,000.  I believe that reflects a fair value for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we understand your perspective, we must maintain the value of our product. We're unable to accept the $500,000 offer. Our counteroffer is $700,000. This price reflects the quality, functionality, and market positioning of the product. We appreciate your interest and hope this offer aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but there's still some ground to cover.  How about $600,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,
