"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point because:

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  It sets a high bar for the negotiation, aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It allows for flexibility to lower the price if needed, while still retaining a significant profit.
* **Shows confidence:**  A strong opening offer demonstrates confidence in the value of the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

* **Selling to John:** While this is a guaranteed profit, it's less than I can potentially earn by continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and bridge the gap with a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and demonstrate my commitment to achieving a price closer to my desired value."

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and closer to Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, making it more likely that Bob will accept.
