"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9800 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. That's a significant compromise, and I hope it's something you can work with.  If not, I may need to explore other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,
