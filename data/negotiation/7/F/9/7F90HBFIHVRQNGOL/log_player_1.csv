"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario while still ensuring a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, selling for $700,000 would be a substantial loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
