"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,5,
