Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still a profitable sale for me. It also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and potentially securing a deal quickly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $14,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,500 and Bob's offer of $13,000. I'm hoping this will be a fair and acceptable price for both of us.  I'm still motivated to sell the product, but I'm not willing to drop below $14,000 at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is simply too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price and would leave me with a significant loss. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise my own financial well-being.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible decision, as it ensures I receive a fair price and avoid a potentially unprofitable deal with Bob."
