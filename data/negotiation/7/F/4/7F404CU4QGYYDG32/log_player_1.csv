Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, though unlikely given his perceived value is $80. 
* **High Anchor:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you've set a high anchor point. This might be beneficial if you decide to negotiate with Bob further.

It's important to note that Bob is unlikely to accept this offer given his perceived value. However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit."
