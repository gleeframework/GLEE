"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep, but $900,000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice is still too high.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to wonder if John might be the better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice is still too high, and I'm worried we're getting into a stalemate.  John is offering a good deal, so I'm going to buy from him."
