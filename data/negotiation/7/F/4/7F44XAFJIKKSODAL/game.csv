"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do like the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer you the product for $100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
