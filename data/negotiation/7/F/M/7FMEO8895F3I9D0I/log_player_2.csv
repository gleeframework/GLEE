"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true market value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite a bit above her valuation. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to her valuation, but there's still room to negotiate. We started quite low, so we can afford to inch upwards a bit and still potentially secure a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $1,225,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is well within a reasonable range of her valuation.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiations stalling out and having to pay John's higher price."
