"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. This product is really valuable and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still too far apart.  I'll counter to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't budge too much yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,750 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $7,500?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice that I am willing to move from my initial offer, but I am still aiming for a price significantly lower than her current offer. By stating I'm ready to close the deal at $7,500, I am applying a bit of pressure while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,250 for it.  This is my final offer, so what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one!  Alice is playing hardball with that ""final offer."" However, $8,250 is a decent price and a good compromise. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to go with John for $10,000."
