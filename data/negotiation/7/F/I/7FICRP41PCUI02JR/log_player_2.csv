"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and Alice has a lower ""floor"" price. There's room to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage to push for a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate seriously. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects.
* **Consider Alice's floor price:** $850,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, making this offer potentially appealing.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Knowing you can go to John for $1,000,000 allows you to push for a lower price, even though this offer is still within your budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have room to maneuver:** You still have 7 rounds left and a safety net with John's offer.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** This gives you the power to wait for a more favorable offer from Alice, or to go with John if the negotiation stalls."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase, but still below Alice's previous offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise but also stand your ground.
* **Testing the waters:** By increasing your offer slightly, you're gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate further.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  This gives you the option to move on to John if Alice continues to be inflexible."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **You have time and leverage:**  You still have 5 rounds and a backup option in John.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can afford to wait and see if Alice becomes more flexible or go with John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer shows that you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but only to a certain degree. It demonstrates your commitment to closing the deal, but also that you won't be taken advantage of.
* **Testing Flexibility:** This is a significant increase from your previous offer, but still less than Alice's current price.  It will gauge if Alice is finally willing to come down.
* **Time is Running Out:**  While you have 4 rounds left, the pressure is on. This offer shows Alice that you are ready to close the deal, but you need to get closer to your target price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  John's offer remains your fallback option.  Knowing this gives you the power to walk away if Alice doesn't meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** She is continuing to increase her price, showing a lack of willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is limited:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of reaching a mutually acceptable price is low.
* **John's offer is a safe haven:**  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget, while minimizing further negotiation with Alice, who has shown stubbornness. 

It's better to secure the product from John now, as continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a dead-end and missed opportunity."
