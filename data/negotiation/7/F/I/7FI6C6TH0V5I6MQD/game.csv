"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, and I'm ready to make a serious offer. How about $950,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - how about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you're not quite ready to go down to $1,000,000 yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,010,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both agree on.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,010,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, so I'll meet you exactly at $1,010,000. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer. What do you think?",1010000.0,Alice,7,
