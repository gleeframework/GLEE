"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $12,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $12,200? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,200 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $12,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",12400.0,Alice,5,
