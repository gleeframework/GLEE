"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Near Bob's Valuation:** Offering it close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting or countering with a strong offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $100,000 difference between the asking price and Bob's valuation provides a buffer for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit, and hopefully, we can finalize a deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than both my asking price and his perceived value of the product. While a quick deal is tempting, I believe I can negotiate a better price, especially since Bob clearly sees the value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of that. It's a strong offer that still gives you a great return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By countering at $1,050,000, I'm suggesting a price point roughly in the middle of our previous offers ($1,100,000 and $950,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reiterating the product's value reinforces its worth to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Phrasing like ""strong offer"" and ""great return on investment"" frames the counteroffer positively, encouraging Bob to see it favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price is fair and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates his seriousness about the deal and suggests he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out negotiations further carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting a good offer now secures the profit."
