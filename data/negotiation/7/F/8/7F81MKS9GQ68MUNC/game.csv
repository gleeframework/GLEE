"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit, and hopefully, we can finalize a deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of that. It's a strong offer that still gives you a great return on investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price is fair and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
