"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit, and hopefully, we can finalize a deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of that. It's a strong offer that still gives you a great return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  There's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue to try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price is fair and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
