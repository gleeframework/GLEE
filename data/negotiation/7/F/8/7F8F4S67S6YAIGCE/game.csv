"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $135.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can do $145 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. ",140.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. I'm still really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than $138. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",138.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $138 is your final offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I can do $142.5 for the product. It's my final offer.",142.5,Alice,9,
