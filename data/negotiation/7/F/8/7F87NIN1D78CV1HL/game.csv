"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere around there?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $11,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
