Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This offer is only valid for a limited time."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $12,000.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate or ultimately sell to John at her minimum price."
