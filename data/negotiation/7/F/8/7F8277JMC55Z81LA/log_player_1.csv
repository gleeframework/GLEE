Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you some room to negotiate downward if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a clear, concise offer:** This helps to keep the negotiation focused and efficient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's a price I can live with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his price of $90, and I'm not willing to go that low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling at a price I'm not comfortable with."
