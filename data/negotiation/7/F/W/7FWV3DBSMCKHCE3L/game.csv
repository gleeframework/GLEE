"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100? This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to get a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $105.  This is my final offer,  so let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
