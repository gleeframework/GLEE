"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, and I have the option to sell to John for a much better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a more acceptable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100? This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $105.  This is my final offer,  so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
