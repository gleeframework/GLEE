Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and it presents a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,400,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but significantly lower than my guaranteed backup price from John ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob by highlighting the discount and the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm also keeping the message positive and encouraging.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the following factors:

* **Maximize Profit:**  $1,400,000 is a better price than my fallback option with John.
* **Increase Chance of Acceptance:** Offering a price below my minimum threshold makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
