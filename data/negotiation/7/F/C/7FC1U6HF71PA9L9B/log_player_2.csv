Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd consider, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000 which meets my needs."
