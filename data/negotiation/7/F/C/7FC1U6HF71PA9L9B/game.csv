"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
