"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a lower price, and I'll be able to get a higher price than my backup offer. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
