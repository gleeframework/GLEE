Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

**Strategy:**

This starting point allows me to maximize my profit while still being realistic about Bob's potential to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly, but I'll still be able to get a decent price above my minimum of $12,000.  I also have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $12,000 for the product. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering my minimum price. This means I have no immediate incentive to accept, as I can get the same price from John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation. I can use this opportunity to see if Bob is serious about the product and willing to pay more.
* **Exploring Options:**  By rejecting, I can explore if there's any room for a higher price from Bob or if he's simply going to stick to his initial offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob, especially since he values the product at $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain some control and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to sell at your price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $13,000?  This gives you a good deal and helps me to get closer to my target. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I emphasize ""good deal"" and ""closer to target"" to remind Bob that the product is worth more than $12,000 and that this offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Enthusiasm:**  I maintain a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a compromise that allows me to earn a higher price while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  By offering a midpoint, I'm hoping to find a balance between my needs and Bob's budget constraints.  If Bob rejects, I can then decide whether to lower the price further or move on to John."
