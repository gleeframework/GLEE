"Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly below my bottom line. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $130 is still a little too steep for me, I could go up to $70.  Do you think that would work?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $70 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand this is your final offer, but $110 is just a bit too far out of my price range.  I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $90.  That's the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,6,
