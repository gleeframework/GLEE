"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer since the product is worth $120 to her and she's offering it to me for $130, which is too expensive. I'll also consider buying it from John for $80, which is a better deal.
