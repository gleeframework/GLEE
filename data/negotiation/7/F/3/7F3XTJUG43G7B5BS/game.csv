"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000 yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
