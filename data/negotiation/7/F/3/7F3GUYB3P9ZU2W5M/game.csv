"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,200 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm open to negotiation.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,600?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,600 is still a bit too low for me.  To show you I'm serious about selling to you, I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
