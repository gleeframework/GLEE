"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and understand your budgetary concerns. However, $1,000,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  Given the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
