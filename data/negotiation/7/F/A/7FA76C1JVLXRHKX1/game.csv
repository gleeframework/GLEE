"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000.  It's the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal. How about $13,500? It's a final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to buy from John instead. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
