"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he has a better option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he still has a better option with John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,200. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down some, but she is still above his budget. John offers a more attractive price, and Bob has already used several negotiation rounds.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John."
