"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal. ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,200. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,5,
