Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have another interested party waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth the minimum price to both you and Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. This creates a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your deal with John. If Bob knows about John's offer, this approach might backfire.
* Gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be highly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
