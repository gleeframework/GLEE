"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000.",14000.0,Bob,4,
