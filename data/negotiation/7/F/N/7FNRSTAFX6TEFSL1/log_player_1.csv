Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A much higher offer significantly increases your potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the offered price is high, vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  might pique Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and begin a negotiation.

**Important:**  This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he flat out rejects this initial offer, you can gradually reduce the price to a level that's still profitable for you while aiming to secure the deal before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
