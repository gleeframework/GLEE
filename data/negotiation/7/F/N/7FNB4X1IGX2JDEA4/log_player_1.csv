Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value and my own limitations.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes it worth continuing the negotiation. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
