"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your interest and its value to me. Let's work towards a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle - $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
