Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I've already come down from $150 to $100, and now you're asking me to go to $80? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so how about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $90, and it's not worth risking missing out on John's offer.  You've reached your maximum budget with Alice and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result."
