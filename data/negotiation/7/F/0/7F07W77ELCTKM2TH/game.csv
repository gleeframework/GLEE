"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. I can meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you consider this price?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $7200, so I'm offering it to you for $7600. This is my best offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",7600.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $7600, so I'm offering it to you for $7300. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",7300.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7150 and $7300, so I'm offering it to you for $7225. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",7225.0,Alice,9,
