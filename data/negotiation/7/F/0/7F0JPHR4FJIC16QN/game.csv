"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000. I'm very interested in the product and believe this price reflects its true value, while also being fair to both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $775000.  While that's closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $750000.  This price recognizes the product's value while giving us both a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $765000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,
