Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is above your minimum value of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value, or at least a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll pay $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$92 is a good compromise, especially considering Bob's previous reluctance. It's a decent profit for me, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a slight increase in price, which may not be worth the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
