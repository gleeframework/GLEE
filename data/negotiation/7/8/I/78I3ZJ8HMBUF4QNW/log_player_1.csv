Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer. It's a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still attractive compared to losing out on the deal entirely. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair offer,"" I'm subtly nudging Bob towards a decision without being overly aggressive."
