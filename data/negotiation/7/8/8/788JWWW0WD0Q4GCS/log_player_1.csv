Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer leaves room for me to potentially compromise if Bob counters, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create the opportunity for a good outcome for both of us. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. If he's not willing to budge, I can always fall back on John's offer, which guarantees my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a considerable loss.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob's initial interest is encouraging, his offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum profit goal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range.  This will allow me to explore further negotiation while keeping the potential sale to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and open to further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer positions me favorably in the negotiation. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong bargaining position.  If Bob rejects, I can re-evaluate his interest and either adjust my offer again or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $10,250 is very close to my desired price point, and it's only a small distance from my last offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away completely, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While $10,250 isn't ideal, it's still a significant profit compared to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

**Strategy:**

This offer presents a good balance of securing a sale and minimizing potential loss. It's likely that Bob is pushing the limit of his budget, making this a good time to finalize the deal."
