"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, the product's value to me is quite significant. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This reflects a more accurate compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. $1,075,000 is too low for me to consider. If you're willing to meet at $1,150,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
