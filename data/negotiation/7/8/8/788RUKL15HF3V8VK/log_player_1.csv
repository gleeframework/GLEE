"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. This is still a good deal for him, as it's closer to his offer than my initial price, and it leaves a bit of wiggle room for potential compromise in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $90 is a good price, and we're already four rounds into the negotiation.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate won't get me a significantly better price, and I risk losing the sale entirely if we run out of rounds."
