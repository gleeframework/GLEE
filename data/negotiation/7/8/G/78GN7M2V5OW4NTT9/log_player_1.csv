Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and the deal is getting closer.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a price above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
