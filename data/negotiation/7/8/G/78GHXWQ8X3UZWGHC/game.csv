"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $6,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering its value to you.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $6,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $5,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",5750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $5,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $5,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",5900.0,Alice,5,
