"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's my absolute top price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice a strong incentive to accept, while still allowing Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $8,500. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and Bob ending up having to buy from John for $10,000 outweighs the potential for further savings."
