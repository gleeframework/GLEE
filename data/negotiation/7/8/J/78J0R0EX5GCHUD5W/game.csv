"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm thinking of meeting you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I'm thinking of a compromise at $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
