"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $18,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's budget. It is in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm thinking of meeting you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is lower than Alice's original offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I'm thinking of a compromise at $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob. Bob has already tried negotiating and Alice seems unwilling to go lower than $13,500. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This will save him $5,500 compared to Alice's offer."
