"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it in hand.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will get the price down to $12,000.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, it's the most sensible option."
