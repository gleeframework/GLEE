"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauge Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than your starting price and a good margin above Bob's perceived value. You have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle.  You'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I acknowledge your offer, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're lowering your price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. 
* **Incremental Steps:**  The decrease is significant but keeps you well above both Bob's offer and your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Justify the Value:** Reiterate the product's value to reinforce your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling his interest. However, $1,400,000 is still too low and below the midpoint between your initial offer and his first offer. You're aiming for a price closer to $1,550,000 or higher. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** You're now proposing a price exactly halfway between your last offer and his last offer, signaling fairness.
* **Clear and Concise:** The offer is presented directly, aiming for a quick resolution.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still keeps you significantly above your guaranteed sale to John, ensuring a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving in smaller increments, and his latest offer is only $100,000 above his perceived value of the product. While you've made concessions, it's clear he's trying to see how low he can go. Rejecting this offer sends a strong message that you're firm on a price closer to your previous offer. You're still willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of significantly devaluing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  While I want to make this work, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I can go down to $1,475,000, but that's my absolute final offer."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  You're stating this is your last offer to convey seriousness and a limit to your flexibility.
* **Slight Concession:** You're making a small concession to show you're still open to a deal, but it's a small movement from your previous offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, you're introducing a sense of urgency, pushing Bob toward a decision. 
* **Above Guarantee:** This offer still keeps you comfortably above your guaranteed sale to John, ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Acceptable Threshold:** Bob's offer is now only $50,000 above his perceived value and dangerously close to your guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  Bob has barely moved from his last offer despite your ""final offer"" statement. This suggests he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable profit of $1,200,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing with Bob for a potentially negligible gain. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure a profitable deal with John."
