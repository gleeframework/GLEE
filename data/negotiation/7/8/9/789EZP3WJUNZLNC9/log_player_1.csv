Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) but still below Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message doesn't state this is a final offer, leaving open the possibility of further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $100 is better than my minimum of $80, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's message indicates he's genuinely interested and willing to pay, which gives me leverage.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially achieve a higher price, even if it means risking a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that you're serious about getting this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring I receive a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and reinforces Bob's interest in the product, building a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  $105 is a significant profit for me, considering my minimum of $80. While I could try to squeeze out another $5,  the risk of losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate is too high. 
* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's message indicates he's still interested and is willing to pay a price closer to my desired range. This suggests accepting his offer is the best way to secure the sale.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks dragging out the process, potentially leading to a stalemate or losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer now guarantees a sale at a good price."
