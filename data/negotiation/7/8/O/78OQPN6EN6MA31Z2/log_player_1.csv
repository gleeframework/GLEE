""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 
 
This offer takes into account the following:

* **Your minimum price:** You need to get at least $100 for the product.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your backup offer:** You have a guaranteed sale for $100 to John.

By offering the product at $95, you are:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still get a price closer to your minimum.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  The offer is time-sensitive since you have another buyer lined up.
* **Aiming for the highest possible profit:** While you have a guaranteed $100, getting $95 from Bob is still a good outcome."
