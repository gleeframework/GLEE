"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product offers.  To move this forward, I can lower the price to $18,000. It's a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,5,
