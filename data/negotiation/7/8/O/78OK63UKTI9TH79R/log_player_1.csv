Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
