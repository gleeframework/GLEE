{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product offers.  To move this forward, I can lower the price to $18,000. It's a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely you won't be able to get it down to your desired price.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $10,000. You'll save time and money by going with the guaranteed deal."
