"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm seeing that we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000 even?",8000.0,Bob,6,
