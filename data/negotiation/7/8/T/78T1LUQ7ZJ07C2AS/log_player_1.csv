"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest and encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is higher than Bob's true value for the product, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had 5 rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't been able to reach a price that meets my minimum requirement of $120.  John is offering me a price that meets my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to move on and sell to John."
