"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number ($60), you're attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** You're signaling that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also prepared to walk away if the price doesn't come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than John's offer. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels like a compromise to both parties.
* **Staying Below Budget:** You're still aiming to pay less than your $80 maximum.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will show how willing Alice is to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $75. I can do $85, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. While $85 is close to your budget, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
