"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a high-quality item, and I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $980000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'd like to revisit my previous offer of $950000. Is there any flexibility on your end?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I can offer it to you for $975000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're in a game of tug-of-war, Bob. I'm not willing to budge much further, but I'm willing to meet you at $970000. This is my last offer, and I expect you to make a serious decision. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",970000.0,Alice,9,
