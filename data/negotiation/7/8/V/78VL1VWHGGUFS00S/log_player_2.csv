# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a remarkable investment. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We're confident this price reflects both the product's worth and your appreciation for it. Let us know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and acknowledges the value you see in the item. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's the most cost-effective option for Bob.  He should buy from John to secure the best price."
