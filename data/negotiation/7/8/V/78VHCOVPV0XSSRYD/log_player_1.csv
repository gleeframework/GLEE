"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm a bit stretched on the budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  $12,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to that with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $13,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  How about $13,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I need you to meet me there. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it's clear Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm also running out of time. Rather than risk another round of negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
