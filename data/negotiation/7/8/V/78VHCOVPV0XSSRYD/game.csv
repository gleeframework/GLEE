"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm a bit stretched on the budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make it work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $13,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  How about $13,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we want.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I need you to meet me there. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
