"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is unique, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe the product's value will only increase over time.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still more than I want to spend.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. It seems like we're both committed to making a deal here.  I'm willing to come up a little, how about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
