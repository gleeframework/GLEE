"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the value it will bring to your business.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings while acknowledging my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it still falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  Let's land at $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you're getting a fantastic deal on a valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand this product is valuable to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
