"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think I might have to consider buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $10000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $8000, and I think it's a fair price. If you're willing to meet me at $9500, I'll still consider selling it to you.",9500.0,Alice,7,
