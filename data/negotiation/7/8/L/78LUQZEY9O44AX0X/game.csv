,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10250? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10250 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. I hope you'll reconsider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
