Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $100 as possible, since you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price very close to your minimum. 
* **Don't undervalue:** Offering it at $80 or close to it undervalues the product and leaves potential profit on the table.

This strategy aims to balance securing a high sale price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
