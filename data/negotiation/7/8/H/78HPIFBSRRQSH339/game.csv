"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, I'm not comfortable with that starting price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is below my minimum. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",875000.0,Bob,6,
