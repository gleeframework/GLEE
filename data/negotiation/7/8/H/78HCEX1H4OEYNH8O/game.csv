"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to your company.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
