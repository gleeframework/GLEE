I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm confident that I can negotiate a favorable price with Bob, but if he rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to make counteroffers or move on to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but it still ensures I make a profit while staying above my minimum acceptable value. I believe this price is fair and should be more attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not going to risk losing a considerable amount of money. I'll sell the product to John at the guaranteed price of $1,500,000. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoid further potentially unproductive negotiation."
