**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, she's still unwilling to meet your budget.  You've been transparent about your alternative option with John at $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not going any lower and you losing out on both options. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you know you can get it for."
