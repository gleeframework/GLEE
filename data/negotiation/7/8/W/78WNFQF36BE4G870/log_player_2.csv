"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to acquire the product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm going to reject it and see if we can get closer to my desired price. I believe there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To demonstrate my serious interest in acquiring this product, I'm willing to go up to $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $975,000. I believe this is the sweet spot where both of us can benefit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $975,000 is still too high. I'm going to reject and continue to negotiate, hoping to get a lower price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I feel there's still potential to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still a bit out of reach.  I'm willing to go up to $940,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $940,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still not ready to give in. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $960,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $960,000, which is a very reasonable price considering our initial goal of saving as much money as possible.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  I'm going to accept the offer and secure this product at a good deal."
