"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject and make a counteroffer to bring the price closer to your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your maximum price of $1,000,000.  You might be able to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still a significant gap from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower than $1,550,000.  You're better off saving time and money by buying the product from John for $1,000,000."
