Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with $11,000 for the product. This price still allows us to maintain a good profit margin while being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal works for you.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. While it's still more than you'd pay to John, it's closer to your maximum price and saves you the time and hassle of continuing negotiations."
