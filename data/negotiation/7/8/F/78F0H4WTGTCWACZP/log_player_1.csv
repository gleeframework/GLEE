Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving myself some room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm using the value of the product to Bob as a basis for the offer.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price further.

This strategy allows me to maximize my earnings while remaining open to negotiation and avoiding the risk of Bob simply rejecting my offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value.  Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is still profitable, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.  
* **Avoiding a quick sell:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is safe, but I'm not in a rush to sell.  Negotiating with Bob could lead to a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept given the value of the product.  This price is still fair considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing firm on my minimum acceptable price while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying my price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm clearly stating my willingness to close the deal at this price, pushing Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's low offer, I maintain control of the negotiation.
* **Push for a better outcome:** I'm aiming for the maximum possible price, even if it means risking a stalemate. 
* **Minimize risk:** I've set my minimum price, ensuring I don't sell the product below my threshold."
