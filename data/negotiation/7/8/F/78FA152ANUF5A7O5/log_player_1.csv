"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I don't know Bob's budget, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, it's not a terrible starting point. I'd rather keep negotiating and see if I can push for a higher price. I'll keep John's offer in mind if things don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I'll also keep John's offer in mind in case things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It's also above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  His offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm getting worried that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. While I'm not thrilled with the prospect of selling to John, it's starting to look like the safer option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000.  This is a big jump from Bob's last offer, but I'm still below my initial asking price. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up without accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm not confident I can get a better price from him with only two rounds left. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking a complete failure with Bob."
