"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you, and I'm sure you'll get great use out of it. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $95. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. Can we do that?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $92.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $97.50 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,7,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can we do that?",95.0,Bob,8,
