This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value but below mine, leaving room for negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
