"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. Starting low gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,500. Would you be interested in taking it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, we're still significantly above her value for the product. We can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to pay $9,000."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:** We recognize her willingness to negotiate with ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice.""
* **Propose a middle ground:**  Suggesting $9,000 positions the deal as fair,  meeting halfway between her previous offer ($10,500) and our last counteroffer ($8,000).
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  We're still aiming for a significant discount, showing we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $10,000? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice has explicitly stated that $10,000 is her lowest price. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Significant Savings:** We're getting the product for $2,000 less than John's price and $2,000 less than our initial budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.  Alice might hold firm, and we'd lose the chance to buy at this price. 

While there might be a tiny chance of getting the price down even further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal at this stage."
