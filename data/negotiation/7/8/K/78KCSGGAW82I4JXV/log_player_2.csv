"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,650,000. This product is worth a significant $1,500,000 to you, and this price reflects its value and the potential for future growth. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for $150,000 more than it's worth to you and her. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure a better price."
