"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
