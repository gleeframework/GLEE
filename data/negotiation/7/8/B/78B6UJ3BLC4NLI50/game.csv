"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $10,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500. However, I'm still not comfortable going that high. Let's compromise at $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to consider $10,000, but I'd like to add that it's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. So, $10,000 is my last offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
