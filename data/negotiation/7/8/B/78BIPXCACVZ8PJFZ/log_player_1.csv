{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it is a fair price given the value to Bob.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than his offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would allow me to meet my needs while still providing you with a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $9250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. While it's a bit lower than my ideal price, it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price and  closer to my desired price.  It is also a good deal for Bob.  I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob for $9,250 rather than selling it to John for $8,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
