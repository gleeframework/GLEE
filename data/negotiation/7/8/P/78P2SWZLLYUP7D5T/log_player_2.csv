"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  Buying from John right now would be settling for your maximum price without even trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and might reveal Alice's willingness to go lower.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though $100 is your maximum, starting at $80 allows you to potentially get a better deal if Alice is willing to meet you closer to your initial offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give you valuable information about how flexible Alice might be on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. We're getting closer to a potential deal, so keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Suggesting a middle ground between your previous offer ($80) and her current offer ($140) shows you're willing to negotiate and move closer to her price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $110 is still below your maximum budget, giving you some room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Testing Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to move from her $140 position."
