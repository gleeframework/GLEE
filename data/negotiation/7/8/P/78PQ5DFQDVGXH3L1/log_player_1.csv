Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe it's worth at least $150, you're anchoring Bob's perception of the value around that price point, making $175 seem like a smaller increase. 
* **Time Pressure (Slight):** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you don't risk losing money by aiming higher with Bob."
