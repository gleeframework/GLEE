Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value ($10,000) but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive language:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard limit, inviting Bob to counteroffer.

This approach balances my desire to get a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of getting stuck in a long negotiation with Bob while John is waiting to buy at my desired price. It's more strategic to reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer that's more aligned with my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Meet in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and his offer, showing that I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Positive language:**  I'm emphasizing that the compromise would be beneficial for both of us. 

This counteroffer is still within my acceptable range, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you value the product highly, Alice. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Could you do $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my price expectations.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, so it's more efficient and less risky to sell to John."
