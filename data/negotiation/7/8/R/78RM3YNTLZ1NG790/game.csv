"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a good asset, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,025,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
