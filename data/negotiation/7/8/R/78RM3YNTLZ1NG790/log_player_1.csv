"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be worth even more in your hands. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a good asset, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is always a backup option. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,025,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal considering we are only on round 4, and I could risk losing the deal altogether if I keep rejecting offers."
