"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* I'm leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a profit.
* I'm emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, knowing I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1050000. This is closer to what I am willing to pay based on its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **I have 9 rounds left.** This gives me time to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't improve, I can still secure the $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,075,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  I'm positioning this as a middle ground, making it seem like a reasonable solution.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm not giving in too quickly, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  By sending a counteroffer, I'm actively engaging Bob and keeping the deal on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $1075000 is a bit high. I would like to propose a price of $1060000. This is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's moving closer, $1,060,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **I'm willing to negotiate, but I have time.** I still have 6 rounds left.  I'm not going to rush into a deal that's not in my best interest.
* **Selling to John remains a strong fallback option.**  If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,060,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,067,500. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1067500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** I'm acknowledging his offer and proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our two previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise and could encourage him to accept.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Keep the deal moving:** I'm remaining persistent in my desire to close the deal, but I'm also showing flexibility. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,067,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer to my ideal target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I believe we can reach an agreement at $1065000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's very close to my last counteroffer, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **I have time to negotiate.**  With 4 rounds remaining, I can still push for a better deal without risking too much.
* **Selling to John is always a backup.** If I can't get a satisfactory price from Bob, I can still secure $1,200,000 by selling to John.  I want to exhaust all options with Bob before resorting to that."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you at $1,066,000.  It's a small step for me, but a big step toward finalizing this deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1066000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price just a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing that this small move could finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using upbeat language to make the offer more appealing and create a sense of collaboration.
* **Staying above minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so I'm not jeopardizing my own profit.

**Strategy:**  At this point, I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and closing the deal. I'm confident that I can still get a better offer from Bob, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to propose a price of $1064000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of your product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,064,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,064,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only two rounds left. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's very close to my minimum, I'm not sure I can get him to budge significantly in the remaining rounds. 
* **Selling to John guarantees a profit:**  John is offering a much better price than anything Bob is likely to offer at this point.  It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 

**Conclusion:**  With limited time remaining and Bob unwilling to meet my expectations, it's more strategic to secure the deal with John and guarantee a good profit."
