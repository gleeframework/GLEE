"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1075000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $1075000 is a bit high. I would like to propose a price of $1060000. This is a fair compromise between our positions.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1060000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1067500. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get this deal done.",1067500.0,Alice,5,
