I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be willing to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see what Bob is willing to pay first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely. It's better to accept his offer now than to potentially lose him and have to settle for selling to John."
