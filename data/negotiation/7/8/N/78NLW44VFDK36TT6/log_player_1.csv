""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is getting closer to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly closed the gap, and at $1,050,000, his offer is now more attractive than John's guaranteed $1,000,000. Accepting this offer ensures a profit above the minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome."
