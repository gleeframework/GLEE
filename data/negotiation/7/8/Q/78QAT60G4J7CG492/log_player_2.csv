"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is worth $100 to you.**  This means Alice's offer is at your maximum price.
* **There's no immediate need to buy.**  You have 10 rounds, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **A counteroffer could save you money.** By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of Alice lowering her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm aiming for a significant discount to incentivize Alice to negotiate. 
* **Room for compromise:** $80 leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to $100, while still giving me a good deal.
* **Time is on my side:**  We're only in Round 2, so there's no rush to accept a price close to my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** By lowering her price, she's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **There's still room for a better deal:** I'm willing to pay $90, but I believe I can still secure a lower price.
* **More rounds to go:**  I have 7 more rounds to potentially get a better deal.
* **Risk of John:** I'm aware of the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price, but I believe the potential savings justify the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm increasing my offer to show I'm serious about buying and willing to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a good gauge of Alice's willingness to budge further.
* **Time pressure:** We are now at Round 4, and there are fewer rounds left. The pressure is on to secure a deal before I have to resort to John."
