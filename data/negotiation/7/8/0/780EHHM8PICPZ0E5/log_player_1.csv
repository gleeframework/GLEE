Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
