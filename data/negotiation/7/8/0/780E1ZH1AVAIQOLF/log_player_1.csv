Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he wants the product badly enough. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

This strategy aims to secure a significantly higher profit than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
