Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
