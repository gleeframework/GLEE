"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll see if he bites. If not, I can adjust downwards, but I want to test the waters first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a decent profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up from his initial offer.  I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, given the value I place on the product."
