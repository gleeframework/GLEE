Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This initial offer demonstrates flexibility and sets the stage for a potential negotiation. 

By starting at $100, you leave room to potentially increase the price if Bob is eager to buy, or you can negotiate down if he's hesitant. Remember, you can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is higher than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price point.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price. You can use this opportunity to send a counteroffer and see if you can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value highly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $92 is very close to your last counteroffer of $95.  It's a good deal for both of you, and accepting it ensures you get a better price than selling to John. It's also worth noting that continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
