Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $120 to both of us.  It's unlikely he'll go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. Selling to John ensures I get the fair value."
