"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being pushed into a corner.
* **Positive Tone:** Using positive language like ""really appreciate"" helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Consideration:** While $130 is better than selling to John for $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. He's expressed interest in the product and acknowledged the value. 
* **Building on Rapport:** By rejecting his counteroffer, I show that I'm serious about getting a fair price. This also gives me the chance to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's close this deal, I think we both can be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($140) and his offer ($130). This shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""good deal"" and ""happy with that price"" to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Closing Statement:**  I end with a statement urging Bob to close the deal, emphasizing the mutual benefit."
