"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth more to Alice than to you, so it is likely she will come down in price. It is always better to try and negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount considering my maximum is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the $850,000 mark. I'm willing to come down slightly, but it needs to reflect the inherent value. How about we consider $1,300,000? I believe this price point offers a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. I will counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
