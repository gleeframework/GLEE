"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount considering my maximum is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the $850,000 mark. I'm willing to come down slightly, but it needs to reflect the inherent value. How about we consider $1,300,000? I believe this price point offers a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
