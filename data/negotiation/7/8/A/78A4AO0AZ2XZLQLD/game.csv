"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to your company. I believe this price point allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800,000. Please consider my offer carefully.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
