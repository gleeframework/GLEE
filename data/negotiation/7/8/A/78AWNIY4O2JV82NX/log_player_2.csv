Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,000? This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great value for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000 which is her value for the product. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
