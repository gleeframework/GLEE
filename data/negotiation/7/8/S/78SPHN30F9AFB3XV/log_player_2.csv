"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $900,000 is still too far from my goal. I'll counter-offer and see if I can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. That said,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $850,000 is still above my limit. John's offer of $800,000 is the better deal at this point."
