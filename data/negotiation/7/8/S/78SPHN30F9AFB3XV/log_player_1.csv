Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. That said,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.
