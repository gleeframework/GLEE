"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. That said,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
