"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger position.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the ""true value"" of the product subtly implies it's worth even more than my asking price, making it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly states I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he counters too low, I may choose to accept John's offer. If he's close, I might be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is Higher:**  While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to push for a better deal.
* **Negotiation is Key:** Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his interest.  By rejecting, I can continue the negotiation and potentially increase the price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have plenty of time to explore better options. Selling to John now would be leaving money on the table.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $1,200,000 but lower than my initial offer.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. This encourages further negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value and Potential:**  I'm re-emphasizing the product's value and potential to justify the price.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  My message highlights the need for a mutually beneficial agreement, which could lead to a quicker deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects again, I'll consider lowering my price slightly in the next round, but only if it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Time is on my side:** With several rounds left, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will budge further.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my safety net. I'm not at risk of losing out entirely by rejecting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's.  I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us while staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the need for a quick resolution and a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and avoids any negative pressure. It aims to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider my options. I'll either lower my offer further, keeping John's offer in mind, or accept Bob's previous offer and close the deal.  The decision will hinge on how close I am to my minimum acceptable price and my assessment of Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Short of Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $25,000 short. I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to be more strategic. I'll aim for a final price that's as close to my minimum as possible.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John and guarantee at least $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum but still slightly above Bob's offer. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary but will also be ready to accept Bob's offer if my next counteroffer is rejected."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,290,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm lowering my offer to just $10,000 above Bob's current offer, demonstrating a strong desire to close the deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I need to show flexibility while staying close to my minimum.
* **Closing Message:** The message emphasizes the importance of finalizing the deal and suggests a win-win situation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to accept his previous offer of $1,275,000 to ensure a sale.  I'll also have to consider selling to John if the next round fails to produce an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1265000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, I need to secure a sale.
* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is $35,000 below my minimum, it's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiation might lead to a better price, but there's a risk of reaching the final round with no agreement.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's still profitable. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  This ensures I get a good price for the product and avoids the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
