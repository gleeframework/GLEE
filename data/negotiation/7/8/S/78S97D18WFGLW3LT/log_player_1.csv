Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values it at $12,000 gives Alice room to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing her $15,000.

By starting at $14,000, Alice:

1. **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice a chance to still get a price higher than $12,000.
2. **Creates a sense of urgency:**  The higher price might encourage Bob to act quickly before he loses the deal.
3. **Maintains a good margin:** Even if Bob accepts the $14,000, Alice makes a significant profit."
