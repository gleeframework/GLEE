Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $12,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 
* **John's Value (your guarantee):** $12,000

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price.  Therefore, you don't need to settle for anything less than $12,000.  However, there's an opportunity to potentially get more from Bob.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm setting the price at $13,500. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** Starting at $13,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""unique value"" subtly implies reasons why your product might be worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" creates a sense of scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get more than both your reservation price and Bob's perceived value.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down slightly, but never below $12,000. 
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You sell to John at your desired price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a different opening offer depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to probe Bob's willingness to pay."
