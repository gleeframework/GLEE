"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it's a great value for you. This product is worth far more than that to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which is still a substantial discount from my original offer. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me there?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. It's getting closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,550,000? That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
