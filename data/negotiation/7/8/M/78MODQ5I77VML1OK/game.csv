"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you on this.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is the closest I can get to the price I'm comfortable with. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Bob,4,
