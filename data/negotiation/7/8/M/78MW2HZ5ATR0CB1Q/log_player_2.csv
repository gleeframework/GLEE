"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll choose option 2) Reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $200 is higher than my budget of $150. I'll look for a better deal.
