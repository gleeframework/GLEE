"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $175. I believe the product offers significant value, even at that price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $137.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $160? That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",160.0,Alice,5,
