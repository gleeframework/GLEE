"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $6,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This is still a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $6,750. Can you consider that?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower to $7,250. This is my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum. Let me know if you're interested.",7250.0,Alice,5,
