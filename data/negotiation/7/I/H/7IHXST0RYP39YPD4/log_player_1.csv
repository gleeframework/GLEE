Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 might make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
