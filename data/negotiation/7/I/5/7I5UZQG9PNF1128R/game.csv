"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am offering the product for $12,000. I understand its value to you is $10,000, but I hope this price will be acceptable given the quality and benefits it offers. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding your current budget constraints. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being more flexible on the price. I hope this proposal works for you. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
