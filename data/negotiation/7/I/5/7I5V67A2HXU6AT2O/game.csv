"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $9,000. Could you possibly lower your price to $8,500? This would allow us to come closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",8750.0,Alice,5,
