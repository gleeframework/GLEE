Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. I know this is a unique item, and I believe it's a great deal at this price. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you don't want to accept anything less than that from Bob.
* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Gauging interest:** This initial high price will gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it indicates he's serious and willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates you down slightly from $19,000, you're still likely to make more profit than selling to John for your minimum."
