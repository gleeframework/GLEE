"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he's not willing to meet my price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I have 10 rounds and can still negotiate with Bob. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $14,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value yet. Bob has shown a willingness to pay close to my desired price, so I'm hoping this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have plenty of rounds left and can continue negotiating. I'm confident I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $14,000.  This is a reasonable compromise and shows I'm serious about making a deal. It's also a good position to be in since I can still go down to John's offer of $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out.  I have four rounds left and I want to try and maximize my profits. I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again at $13,500. This is a good compromise and shows I'm willing to negotiate. This also leaves some room for negotiation in the next round if Bob is still unwilling to meet my price. I'm confident I can secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is $12,500, which is above my minimum value of $12,000 and a decent profit. I only have two rounds left, so it's unlikely I'll be able to get a higher price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
