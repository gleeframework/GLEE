Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  The $14,000 price is still below Bob's estimated value of $15,000, making it appealing to him.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that you're open to discussion and willing to work with Bob.

This approach allows you to maximize your potential earnings while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial $14,000, potentially finding a middle ground.  Selling to John would guarantee a lower but safe price, but you have more leverage with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between your initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:**  $12,250 is still above your minimum price of $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out on value.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price range and only slightly above John's offer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make a final counteroffer that could potentially secure a better price for you.  You can try to get closer to your initial $12,250 by suggesting a slight compromise, keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is your final offer creates a sense of urgency and potentially encourages Bob to accept, as he knows there may not be a better price.
* **Minimum Acceptable:** $12,000 is your minimum, so accepting this offer ensures you don't lose money.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product at $15,000 to Bob strengthens your position and suggests a good deal for him.

This strategy aims to push Bob toward accepting while still guaranteeing you a reasonable price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,900, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer of $11,900 is very close to your minimum, it's still below your desired price range.  Considering the back-and-forth negotiation, it's likely that further rounds won't result in a significantly higher price.  John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection.

In this situation, securing the safe and guaranteed price from John is the most logical decision."
