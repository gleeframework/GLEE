"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,900, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget.",11900.0,Bob,6,
