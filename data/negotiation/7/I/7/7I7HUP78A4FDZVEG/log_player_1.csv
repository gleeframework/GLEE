Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (Bob's perceived value) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price might be more appealing than waiting.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay (which is unrealistic in many real-world scenarios).
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will have to settle for $10,000 from John."
