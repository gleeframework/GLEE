"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer.  It's way above your budget, and you can get the product for less from John. Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's below your maximum price but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice is getting closer, but $9,500 is still too high. We can try one more counteroffer to see if we can get to a price we're both happy with."

This offer is a compromise, closer to Alice's price but still within your budget.  Let's see if this is enough to get a deal!"
