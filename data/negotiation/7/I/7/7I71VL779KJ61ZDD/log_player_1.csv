Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. "",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use to counter-offer.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $2,000,000, netting you a significant profit over your guaranteed sale price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. A more aggressive approach might aim even higher, but risks alienating Bob and forcing you to sell to John."
