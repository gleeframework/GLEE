"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. Would you be willing to pay $15000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better alternative with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than what he's willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $9500 is quite enough for me to make this deal worthwhile. How about we try $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is too high for Bob, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
