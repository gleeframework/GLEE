"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Confident Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, Alice aims to justify the high asking price and create a perception of the product's desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,000,000 offer is significantly higher than Alice's minimum, providing space for negotiation and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's worth to him. While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Bob than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:**  Alice clearly states that Bob's offer is unacceptable and reinforces the product's value.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $75,000 signals flexibility but keeps the price well above Alice's minimum and closer to her initial ask. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""find a compromise"" and ""acknowledging your interest"" encourages a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer is $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $850,000, which is a substantial increase from his previous offer and a significant profit above your minimum. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might not budge much higher, and you'd be left with the $800,000 offer from John. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a stalled negotiation."
