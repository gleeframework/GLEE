"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-value item at a competitive rate. Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $10,000. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice only values the product at $8,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $9,000 for the product?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain my product's value. I am unable to accept $9,000 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $9,500 as a compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,500, which is a good compromise.  It's a good price for you, and you're still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John."
