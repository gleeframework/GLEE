You should reject Alice's offer.  You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice. You are also not under pressure to accept the offer since you have a backup option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
