"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $105? It's getting close to what I'm willing to pay.,105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $115 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and my original offer of $100. How about $107.50?,107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $115, Bob. I think $107.50 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $111.25?",111.25,Alice,7,
