Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers.  Would a price of $1,450,000 interest you?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob won't pay more than his perceived value ($1,000,000). Offering it near your minimum ($1,500,000) is unlikely to succeed.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above $1,500,000."
