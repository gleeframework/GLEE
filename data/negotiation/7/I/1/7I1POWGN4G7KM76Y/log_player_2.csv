"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's still room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $150 limit. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I could meet you halfway at $125. It's a fantastic price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met me halfway, and $125 is a great price, saving me $25 off my maximum. There's not much point in haggling further for a potentially small gain."
