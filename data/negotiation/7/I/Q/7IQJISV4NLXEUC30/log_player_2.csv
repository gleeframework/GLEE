"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the discount, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000 and is a good deal for Bob. It's still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000 and leaves some room for profit.  At this point, further negotiation might not be worth the time, as the potential savings are smaller.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
