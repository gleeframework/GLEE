"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get close to your desired price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
