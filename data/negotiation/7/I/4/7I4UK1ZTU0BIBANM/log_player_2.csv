"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your operations. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still beneficial to both of us. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a mutually profitable deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

It makes the most financial sense to accept Alice's offer."
