"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your operations. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still beneficial to both of us. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a mutually profitable deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
