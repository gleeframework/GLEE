"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that can significantly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* However, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. 
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity for negotiation."
