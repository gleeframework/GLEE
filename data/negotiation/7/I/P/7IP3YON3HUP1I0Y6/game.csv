"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you a compromise at $18000. This is a significant discount from the original offer, but it's still a good value for the product's quality and features. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still out of my price range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $16500.  This shows a genuine effort on my part to reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I can offer you a slight discount to $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the continued negotiation. While I'm interested in the product,  $17500 is still above my budget.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to offer $16000.  This demonstrates a strong commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're making a genuine effort to reach an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16750. This is a fair price that balances our needs, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16750 is getting closer, but it's still a bit out of my reach.  If we can agree on $16250, I think we can both walk away feeling satisfied.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase.  What are your thoughts?",16250.0,Bob,8,
