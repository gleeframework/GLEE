"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $950,000? That's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $950,000, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I need to be realistic about my own needs. $920,000 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $935,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $935,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",915000.0,Bob,6,
