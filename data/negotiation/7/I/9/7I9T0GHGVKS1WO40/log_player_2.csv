"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000.  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,050,000, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,062,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,068,750?  That's a small step closer to your offer, and it keeps us both within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,050,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal if he keeps pushing. The fact that he has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 gives Bob leverage to push Alice further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,068,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my last offer of $1,062,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
