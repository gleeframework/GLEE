"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's clear she's starting with an inflated price hoping you'll negotiate down from there.  You have a much better alternative with John at $8,000 so there's no need to accept a price this high. It's time to counter-offer and bring the negotiation closer to a realistic price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $4,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 4000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Alice started extremely high, so an aggressive counter-offer is appropriate to steer the negotiation in the right direction.
* **Anchoring:** This counter-offer establishes a low anchor point, which can influence the rest of the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** While $4,000 is much lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation. You can always increase your offer gradually if needed.

The goal is to see how Alice responds and adjust your strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $4,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, $10,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and you haven't reached a point where accepting Alice's offer is your best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $6,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but not too much.
* **Midpoint Negotiation:**  You're aiming towards a price point between your last offer ($4,000) and her current offer ($10,000). 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still a good distance from your $8,000 alternative with John, giving you leverage to walk away if needed.

This counter-offer balances showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $6,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has actually increased her offer from $10,000 to $14,000. This indicates that she's not negotiating in good faith or is unwilling to reach a price that's reasonable for you. It's clear that continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price anywhere near your $8,000 alternative with John. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal with John."
