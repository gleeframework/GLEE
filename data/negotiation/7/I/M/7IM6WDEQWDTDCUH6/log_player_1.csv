Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is less than what Bob values the product at ($150), giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate upwards without going too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice. That's a bit high for me though.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is a profit, it's still below the midpoint of your ideal price and Bob's value.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference?  $105. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $95 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$95 is a good price considering Bob's counteroffer and your minimum.  This is a solid profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the uncertainty of further negotiation."
