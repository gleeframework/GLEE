"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference?  I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This gives you a great deal and lets me get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $860,000 as a compromise. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $860,000 is still too far off. How about $880,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can come right now. Let's make this happen. ",880000.0,Alice,5,
