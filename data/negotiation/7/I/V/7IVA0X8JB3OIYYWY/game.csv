"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential returns.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value and potential returns justify a higher price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $700000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $650000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's features and benefits.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I still think the product's value and potential returns justify a higher price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $675000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing the product's value, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to offer it to you for $675000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",675000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $675000. I've reached my limit and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to think about buying the product from John for $1500000. Thank you for the opportunity to negotiate, but I think I've reached a dead end.",1500000.0,Bob,10,
