"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below my maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if I can get it even lower. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a better price.  I'm prepared to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my initial target.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again in the next round.  I still have a lot of room to bargain before I reach my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  Let's try to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, though. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $800,000.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk she might not budge further.  At this point, it's a good deal for me considering my budget and the risk of having to buy from John. I'd rather secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
