# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject and counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to proceed with the sale."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above your budget, but closer.  Since you have more rounds and John is an option, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can potentially get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a reasonable deal. I'm confident we can finalize the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a reasonable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your budget, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get her down to your maximum limit of $1,000,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,080,000 is still a bit above my limit.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a satisfactory agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above your budget and she's stated it's her final offer.  You only have a few rounds left and it's unlikely she'll come down further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at your maximum budget to ensure you get the product."
