"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves me with a profit. This should incentivize him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is more than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, considering the value to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $9,000, which is close to my target price of $10,000. Accepting this offer will allow me to make a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
