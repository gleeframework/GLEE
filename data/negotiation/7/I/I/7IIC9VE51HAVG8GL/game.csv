"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair offer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is what I could get it for elsewhere.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand it's a valuable product, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
