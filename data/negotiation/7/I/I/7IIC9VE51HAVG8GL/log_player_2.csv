"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, as there's potential to save money."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is what I could get it for elsewhere.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is less than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since he can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to try and get the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand it's a valuable product, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
