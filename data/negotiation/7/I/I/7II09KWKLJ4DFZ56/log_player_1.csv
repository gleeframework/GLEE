Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $120 provides leverage. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $100."
