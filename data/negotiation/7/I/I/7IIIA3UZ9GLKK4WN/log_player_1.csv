{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate. It also acknowledges the value for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is the middle ground, I was thinking more like $95. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum price point of $80.  It's also a significant improvement on his previous offers.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
