Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that I think is reasonable, considering the minimum value I have in mind ($150). Let's say I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $200}

This is a bit above the minimum value I have in mind, but I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for $50, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $50, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than that but still lower than my minimum value of $150. Let's say I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $120}

This is a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price."
