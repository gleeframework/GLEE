"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $12,000, which is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's try $9,500. This would still allow you a decent profit, and it's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiations, but $11,000 is still more than I can afford.  My final offer is $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn and is unwilling to come down to Bob's price range. At this point, Bob should cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000. He has only 3 rounds left, and it is unlikely that Alice will change her mind."
