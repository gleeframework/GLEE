"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However,  $1,100,000 is slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a fair compromise given both of our positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer the product to you for $1,075,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
