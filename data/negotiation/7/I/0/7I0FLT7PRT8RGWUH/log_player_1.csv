Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
