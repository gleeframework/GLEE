Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to think about it. Let me propose a price of 1125000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still above my target price of $1,500,000.  With only one round left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially failing to reach an agreement is too high.  It's better to secure the product from John at a price that is within my budget, even if it's not the most ideal scenario."
