,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at 1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of 1150000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1150000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1100000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can close the deal quickly at this price.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with 1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think about it. Let me propose a price of 1180000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and my profit margin. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1180000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still being within my budget. Let's close this deal and avoid wasting any more time.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your commitment to 1100000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for both of us. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm thinking of a price of 1120000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but $1120000 is still slightly out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and offer $1110000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your profit margin while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal, I believe we're both very close to an agreement.",1110000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to think about it. Let me propose a price of 1125000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,9,
