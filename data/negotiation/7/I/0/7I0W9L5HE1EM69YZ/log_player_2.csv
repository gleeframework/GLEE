Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $78, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $86. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit on this.  I can offer you $80, but that's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're giving Alice one last chance to meet at a price that works for us.  This offer is still below our walk-away point, but it gives Alice a small profit and avoids further negotiation.  If she rejects this, we'll go with John in the next round."
