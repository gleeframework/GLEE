"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price higher than your backup option. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower and you risk her walking away from the deal entirely. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
