"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,100,000 vs $800,000).** This means Alice is likely willing to negotiate. 
* **John's price is your maximum acceptable price ($1,200,000).** You can use this as leverage in negotiations with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay her asking price. This opens the door for potential counteroffers from Alice."
