"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The initial offer from Alice is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to explore that before committing. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move that demonstrates my desire to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount of money. I'm aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still above my ideal target.  I have rounds left, and there's potential to drive the price down further. I'll continue to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good deal. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price point that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is now within my acceptable range and close to my desired price. Accepting the offer at this point ensures I acquire the product while saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential benefit."
