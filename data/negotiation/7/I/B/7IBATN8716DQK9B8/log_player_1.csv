"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially considering its potential for future growth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands, while ensuring its value is recognized."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm happy to continue this conversation, but  $1,400,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly above his perceived value and below my minimum. I'll counter-offer again to try and push him higher before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to make a significant move. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

-  **Strategic Concession:** I've made another significant drop in price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to finalize the deal.
- **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm close to my limit.
- **Midpoint:** This price point is closer to the middle ground, which might make it more appealing to Bob. 
- **John as Backup:**  I'm still open to selling to John if Bob rejects this offer, as it's crucial to secure a deal above my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential delays in receiving payment.
* **Stronger Position:** Accepting Bob's offer portrays a willingness to compromise and builds goodwill for a potentially beneficial future relationship."
