"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price of $10,000. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further to get a better price. You still have a chance to get it for less than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my final offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating, you're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price, as you're guaranteed to get it for $10,000. This eliminates the risk of further negotiations potentially falling through or exceeding your budget."
