Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,575,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal.
