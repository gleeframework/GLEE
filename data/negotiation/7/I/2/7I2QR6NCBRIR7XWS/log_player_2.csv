"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting price is already pretty close to your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little high for me though.  Would you consider $85?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I could come down to $90. It's a fair offer for a product you'll value at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, and while we could try to negotiate further, $90 is a reasonable price and saves us $10 compared to John. It's not worth the risk of pushing Alice away."
