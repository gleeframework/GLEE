"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  My hope is that Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary. 

I'm setting this price knowing that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000.  This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I want to try and get closer to my initial price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's, to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly. It leaves some room for further negotiations but isn't too far off from my acceptable minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I'm running out of time. There's a chance I could negotiate a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or the negotiation dragging on is too high. Accepting his offer now guarantees a sale that's close to my desired outcome."
