Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to lower the price. 
* **Highlight Value to Bob:** Emphasize how much more the product is worth to Bob than the asking price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position.  This allows for a bolder offer to Bob."
