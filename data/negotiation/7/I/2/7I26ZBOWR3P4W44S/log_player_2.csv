"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Rejecting is the best option:**  There's room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Strategy:** Start with a lower offer, closer to Alice's minimum value ($10,000). This shows that Bob is serious about buying, but wants a good deal.
* **Counteroffer Calculation:** $10,500 is the midpoint between Bob's maximum ($12,000) and Alice's minimum ($10,000). This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price but closer to his budget.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get closer to his target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Bob is making small concessions to show he's serious about buying while still aiming for a better price.
* **Counteroffer Calculation:**  $10,750 is closer to Alice's offer but still within Bob's budget, and it allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,875. This is a fair compromise that will get us both closer to our goals. I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,875 is still higher than Bob's preferred price, but closer to his budget. 
* **Rejecting and Counteroffering:**  Bob can likely still get a slightly better deal by counteroffering one last time. There's not much room left for negotiation, but even a small reduction in price would be beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10,875 is still a little outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $10,800, which is a very fair price for both of us. This would be the final offer I can make. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Bob is making a final counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price. He's emphasizing that this is his final offer. 
* **Counteroffer Calculation:**  $10,800 is very close to Alice's offer, but it still gives her a slight profit margin while being well within Bob's budget."
