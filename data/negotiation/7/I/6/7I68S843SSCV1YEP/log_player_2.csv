"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed with exceptional quality and functionality in mind. Given its value and benefits, we believe it's worth $150. Considering its worth to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $150 to you, and John is willing to sell it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
