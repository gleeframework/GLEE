Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Language:** Using confident language about the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer leaves ample room for negotiation, signaling to Bob that you are open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  Knowing you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000 provides a strong safety net. You can afford to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is already above his own perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating there's room for him to go higher.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $1,200,000 would be a significant loss compared to your guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000).
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $1,750,000."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to move from your initial price, but not drastically. It's a significant drop from your first offer but still well above both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The $1,750,000 price point keeps you in a strong negotiating position. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed but still ensures a substantial profit if accepted. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the message implies the product's value justifies the price without directly refuting Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now higher than the $1,500,000 you'd get from John. 
* **Strong Profit:** This price still represents a significant profit for you, even though it's lower than your initial asking price.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While you might be able to squeeze a bit more from Bob, there's a risk he'll walk away if you keep pushing. Accepting his offer secures a great deal now."
