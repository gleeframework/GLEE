"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $15000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Realistic but Negotiable:** $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for both parties to compromise.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a respectful tone in the message is crucial for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to go up to that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, creating a more favorable scenario.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting the offer at $14,000 would save Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation might yield an even lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or John's offer changing outweighs the potential savings."
