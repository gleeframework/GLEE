"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing terms further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that asking price is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm proposing we come down significantly to $800,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a more realistic figure.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is considerably below its true value.  I've done extensive research and analysis to determine a fair price, and I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but that price remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, reflecting a significant move on my part. This offer demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while staying within reasonable financial boundaries.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you're serious. However, we're still a considerable way apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to ensure that this transaction aligns with the product's true worth and market value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that figure is still beyond what I'm prepared to pay. To be completely transparent, I do have another option available for $1,000,000. However, I believe in your product and would much prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
