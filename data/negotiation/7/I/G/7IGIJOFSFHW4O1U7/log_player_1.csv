"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing terms further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($2,300,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""exceptional value"" aims to justify the high initial price.
* **Openness:** Mentioning  ""discussing terms further"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counter.
* **Strategic Goal:** The aim is to create a perceived value much higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, pushing him closer to the $1,500,000 mark.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that asking price is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm proposing we come down significantly to $800,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a more realistic figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal than John's offer. By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and initiate a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is considerably below its true value.  I've done extensive research and analysis to determine a fair price, and I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's inherent worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:**  Explaining that the previous offer was ""considerably below"" true value provides a reason for the counter.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's potential to ""generate significant returns"" aims to reframe Bob's thinking away from a low price.
* **Concession & Anchor:**  While still above both your minimum and Bob's valuation, coming down to $1,900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate. This aims to anchor the price in a higher range than Bob's initial offer.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  The goal is to entice Bob to counter again, moving closer to a mutually beneficial price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but that price remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, reflecting a significant move on my part. This offer demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while staying within reasonable financial boundaries. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased to $1,100,000, which is a positive sign, but it's still below your $1,500,000 walk-away point. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. We're now past the halfway point of the rounds, so increasing the pressure on Bob is key to reaching a favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you're serious. However, we're still a considerable way apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to ensure that this transaction aligns with the product's true worth and market value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement & Pressure:** Acknowledging Bob's move shows willingness to negotiate but introduces a sense of urgency with the ""final offer"" tactic.
* **Significant Drop & Justification:** Dropping to $1,600,000 is a substantial concession, but the justification of ""true worth and market value"" aims to maintain a high perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts Bob in a position where he's close to your walk-away point. It forces him to either significantly increase his offer or risk losing the deal.
* **John Option:**  While the message implies this is your final offer to Bob, you still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects this offer. This strategy keeps the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that figure is still beyond what I'm prepared to pay. To be completely transparent, I do have another option available for $1,000,000. However, I believe in your product and would much prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult decision, but accepting Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the most strategic choice at this point:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, time is running out to secure a deal with either Bob or John.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated his final offer and revealed his alternative option at $1,000,000. It's highly unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While $1,200,000 is less than your ideal price and John's offer, it's still a significant profit above your minimum. 

Accepting now guarantees a good outcome, whereas continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving you with the $1,500,000 from John."
