"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you given its worth of $80 to you. I'm looking to maximize my earnings on this sale, so I propose a price of $100 for the product. This allows us both to benefit - you get a high-quality item at a reasonable price, and I achieve a satisfactory return on my investment. Please let me know if this offer suits you.",100.0,Alice,1,
