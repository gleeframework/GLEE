Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
