"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,750 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and agree on $8,000. That way, we both get a fair deal.  I'm willing to give you my final offer and hope you'll accept.",8000.0,Alice,5,
