"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is within your budget of $100.
* **Buying from John costs $100.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to **accept Alice's offer** and save $10."
