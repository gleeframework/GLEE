"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me to achieve a good profit.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $1,200,000 is a high price. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a substantial benefit compared to your alternative options. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
