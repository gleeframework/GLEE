I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth $15000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. Is this a deal you'd like to accept?,14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $13500? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value you place on the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $13000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $13000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13500 is too high, but I can do $13250? It's a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $13250 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $12800. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12800.0,Bob,6,
