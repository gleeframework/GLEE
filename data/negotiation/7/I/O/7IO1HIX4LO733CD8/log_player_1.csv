"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is below my initial offer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This reflects a fair balance between our desired prices. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to take a slight loss to potentially get a higher offer in the next round. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and I believe there's a chance to close the deal at a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is a fair offer that takes into account both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $882,500. This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $882,500 is very close to my minimum desired price of $800,000. We are now in round 6, and with limited rounds left, accepting this offer seems like the most sensible choice. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, leaving me with John's offer of $800,000.  Therefore, accepting this offer secures a sale close to my minimum and ensures a profit."
