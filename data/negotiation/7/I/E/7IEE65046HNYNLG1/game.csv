"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that will significantly benefit your business. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details further. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
