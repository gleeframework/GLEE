**Reasoning:** 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems pretty firm at $1,175,000.  We're still getting a significant profit over our minimum ($800,000) and waiting any longer carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to accept the backup offer. It's better to take the sure win now."
