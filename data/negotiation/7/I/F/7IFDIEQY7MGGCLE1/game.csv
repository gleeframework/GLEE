"Alice, while I appreciate your product, $15,000 is too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant step for me. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
