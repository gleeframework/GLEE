Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your product, $15,000 is too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant step for me. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.
