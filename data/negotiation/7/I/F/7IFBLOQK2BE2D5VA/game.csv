"Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $12000 is definitely below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000.  That's still a good deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
