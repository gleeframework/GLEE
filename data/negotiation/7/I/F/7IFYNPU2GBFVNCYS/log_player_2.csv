"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I would like to propose a price of $85 for it. I hope this offer aligns well with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and Alice is asking for $85. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback.**  You can always buy from John for $100 if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $85 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $75 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $75 is still below your maximum of $100.
* **Significant reduction:** The offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer, but it's a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I would like to propose a price of $80 for it. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has lowered the price, $80 is still above your maximum of $100.
* **You have more rounds:** There's still time to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback:**  You can always buy from John for $100 if you can't get a better deal from Alice.

It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible.  You're not under pressure to accept Alice's offer just because it's lower than her first offer.  Continue to negotiate until you reach a price that you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $80 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $77.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal today.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 77}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** This offer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating that you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Still within your budget:** $77 is still below your maximum of $100.
* **Appeals to Alice's sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" could incentivize Alice to accept. 
* **Leaves room for a slight compromise:** This offer leaves a little room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher price if she needs to, but it's getting closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your desire to make a purchase today. In light of your proposal, I would like to counter with a price of $79 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $79 is only slightly above your last counteroffer of $77.
* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for $21 less than what you would pay John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you're running out of rounds.

It's a good idea to accept Alice's offer and secure the product. You've successfully negotiated a good price, and continuing to bargain could result in the deal falling apart or you ending up paying more to John."
