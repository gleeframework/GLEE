"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be sure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1,000,000 falls below my initial expectations, I recognize your interest and am ready to make a significant move.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This price reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her ""final offer"" and she's unlikely to go much lower.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of pushing her further and potentially losing the deal.  You can get the product for your target price from John, so there's no need to negotiate further with Alice."
