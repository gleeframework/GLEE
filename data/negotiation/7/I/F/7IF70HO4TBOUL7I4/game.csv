"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere around that mark?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be sure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1,000,000 falls below my initial expectations, I recognize your interest and am ready to make a significant move.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This price reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
