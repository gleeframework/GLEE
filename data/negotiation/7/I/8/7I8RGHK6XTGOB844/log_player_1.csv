"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts high, aiming for a large portion of the potential profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start strong, as Bob has a significant incentive to buy the product at a lower price than he values it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm going to try to push for a better price.  Bob is motivated to buy this, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I've got 6 rounds left and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time. This shows flexibility and increases the chances of him accepting. We're getting closer to a deal, and I still have 5 rounds left."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time.  $900,000 is very close to my minimum, but I still have 2 rounds left, and there's always a chance Bob will budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer, meeting Bob halfway. This is a big risk, as I'm essentially making a ""take it or leave it"" offer. However, with only one round remaining, I have to maximize my chances of getting the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's a tough choice, but given we are at the final round and Bob's offer is just $50,000 below my minimum, I'll accept the offer.  This is a decent result, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely."
