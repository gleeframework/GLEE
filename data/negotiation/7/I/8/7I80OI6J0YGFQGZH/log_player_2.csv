"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with her further, there's no guarantee you'd succeed. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price you're comfortable with and saves you time and effort."
