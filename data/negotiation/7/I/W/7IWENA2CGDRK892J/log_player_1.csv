Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's:

* **Above your minimum:**  Obviously!
* **Below Bob's valuation:** To make it attractive to him.
* **High enough to maximize your profit:**  Don't be afraid to be ambitious!

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Fair Price:**  Positions the price as reasonable while still leaving you a significant profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Subtly implies you're not desperate, even though John is a safety net.

**Important Notes**

* This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price based on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style.
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob tries to lowball you. You have a strong alternative with John. 
* Observe Bob's reaction to your initial offer. His response will give you clues about his willingness to pay more or less."
