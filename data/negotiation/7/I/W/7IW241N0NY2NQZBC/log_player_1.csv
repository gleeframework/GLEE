{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving me some room to negotiate. However, it's also below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, suggesting a potential for a win-win scenario. By expressing it as a good deal for both of us, I'm trying to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value is $15,000 and you're willing to sell it for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While he is willing to pay more than my backup offer from John, I am confident I can get a better deal. I will counteroffer Bob and see if I can reach a price closer to my goal of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and it would still be a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and your original offer. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still less than my ideal price of $12,000, it is significantly higher than my fallback option of $8,000 from John. Given Bob's willingness to meet me halfway, I believe this is a good deal and a reasonable compromise."
