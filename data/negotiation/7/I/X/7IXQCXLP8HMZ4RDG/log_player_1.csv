Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm hoping he'll counter, and then we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. Hopefully this will be enticing enough for Bob to consider, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum of $1,500,000. While $1,150,000 is tempting, it's not worth it to me to accept an offer so far below what I believe the product is worth. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be close enough to his desired price that he'll be willing to accept it. If not, I'm prepared to go to John, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not willing to negotiate any further with Bob. His offer is too far below my minimum, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  I'm choosing to sell to John and secure the best possible price for the product."
