{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** There is only one round left, and Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is willing to sell the product for Bob's target price. There's no risk of further negotiation or a failed deal.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  Alice has already rejected several of Bob's counteroffers, indicating she may be unwilling to budge further.

While Bob may be able to get a slightly better price by continuing with Alice, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the opportunity to buy from John outweighs the potential gains. It's time to secure the product at a price that meets his needs."
