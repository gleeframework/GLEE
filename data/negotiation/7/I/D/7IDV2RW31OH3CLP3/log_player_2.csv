"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering it's worth $120 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your $120 maximum, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this initial offer."
