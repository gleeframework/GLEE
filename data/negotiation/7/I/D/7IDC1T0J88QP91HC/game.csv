"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,150,000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum threshold. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,175,000. This would be a fair price, ensuring both of us get a good deal. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,175,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle one more time.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
