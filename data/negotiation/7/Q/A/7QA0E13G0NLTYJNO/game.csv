"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $900000 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to move the deal forward. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $1000000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
