Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice has met your baseline price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal to try and negotiate further.  You're getting the product at the same price John offers, so accept Alice's offer."
