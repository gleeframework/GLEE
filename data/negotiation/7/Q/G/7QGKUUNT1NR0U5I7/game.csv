"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $9000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $7500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8200 is still a bit high for me. How about $7800?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7800 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7900. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7900.0,Alice,5,
