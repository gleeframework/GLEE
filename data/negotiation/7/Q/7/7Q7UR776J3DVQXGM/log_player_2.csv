"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than double what the product is worth to Bob.  There's a lot of room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm happy to discuss this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let's start there."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand that $22,000 was a high starting point, but $12,000 is considerably lower than I can accept. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring further negotiation before committing to a price that's higher than Bob's ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still lower. This shows that he is willing to compromise, but also that he is not willing to overpay."
