"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal as the price comes down. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off, we know we have a lot of work to do. If he's willing to negotiate, it suggests he sees value in the product.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's offer ($15,000), so we can afford to be a bit more ambitious in our opening with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm happy to discuss this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let's start there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $15,000. We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Accepting his offer now would leave a lot of money on the table. We'll use the next round to counter and try to draw him closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand that $22,000 was a high starting point, but $12,000 is considerably lower than I can accept. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** We've significantly reduced our asking price from $22,000 to $18,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's unique value and potential benefits for Bob's business, we're reinforcing its worth and justifying a higher price.
* **Compromise:**  We're explicitly positioning this counteroffer as a compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
