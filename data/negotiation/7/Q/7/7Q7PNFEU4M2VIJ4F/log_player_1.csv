"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while also trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm willing to negotiate further. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and this offer might be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I think there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a price closer to my minimum while still being open to negotiation. I'm feeling optimistic that Bob might accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I will consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price but not quite there yet.  With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to get the price I want. It's not a huge difference in price, but I'm not willing to risk losing out on the deal entirely. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's last offer. I'm going to sell to John."
