"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price closer to my desired value, knowing Bob values it at $80. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly opening:** I'm aiming for a positive and open negotiation by emphasizing the product's value and offering a starting price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation without me immediately having to drop below my $100 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a nice product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum value of $100. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's clearly interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can find a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer:**  While John is a reliable option at $100, I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting more from Bob. I have several rounds left, and a counteroffer could bring us closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a chance to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $85 is halfway between my initial price of $90 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him in the middle. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth while emphasizing the deal I'm offering.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging by using phrases like ""great value"" and ""let me know what you think."" This helps maintain a good negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $75 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **More room for negotiation:** We've both made concessions, and there's still potential to find a price that works for both of us. I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to accept a loss just yet. I want to see if Bob will come up to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $75 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:** My counteroffer of $80 is halfway between my previous offer of $85 and Bob's offer of $75.  This shows I'm willing to continue compromising while staying close to my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to emphasize that it's a win-win situation. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal."" This subtly pushes Bob to make a decision."
