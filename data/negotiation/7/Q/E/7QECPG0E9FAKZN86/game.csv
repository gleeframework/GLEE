"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,650,000. How about we meet at $1,550,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,550,000 is still a significant step away from what I believe the product is worth. To make this work, I could come down to $1,625,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,575,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
