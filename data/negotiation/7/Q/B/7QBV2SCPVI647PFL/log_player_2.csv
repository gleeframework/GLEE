"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $120, but it's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further."
