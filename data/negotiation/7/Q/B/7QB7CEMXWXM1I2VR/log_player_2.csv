"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you.  There's room for negotiation and you can potentially save a lot of money by making a counteroffer. Buying from John immediately would be a waste of your negotiation advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure an even better price.  Buying from John right now would mean missing out on potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This would be a good middle ground for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a better price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $975,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that the price won't drop much further.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate.  Additionally,  buying from John would cost you significantly more."
