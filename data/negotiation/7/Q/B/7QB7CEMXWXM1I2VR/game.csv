"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your desire for a better price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Alice,5,
