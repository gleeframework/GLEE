{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a great deal for Bob!  While $950,000 is a significant amount, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in rejecting and seeing what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  $800,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer and represents a significant saving for Bob. This move might be aggressive, but it sets the stage for a negotiation and leaves room for compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is showing some flexibility by dropping her price, but Bob can still do better. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price."

This could be a sweet spot where both parties might find common ground."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is again showing some flexibility, but her offer is still too high for Bob's target price. While $925,000 is a good price, Bob can continue to try for a lower price and save more money."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $940,000 is close to Bob's maximum acceptable price, it's still above his target price. Bob has already rejected a similar price, so he has leverage to continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can potentially secure a lower price if he continues to bargain."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is close to Alice's last offer, but it's still within Bob's acceptable price range. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but won't budge further. It's a calculated risk that could either seal the deal or lead to a final counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $955,000 is a tempting price, Bob is still determined to get a better deal.  He's only one round away from having to buy from John at a much higher price. He's proven his willingness to negotiate, and this final round could be the moment to push for a price closer to his target. It's a gamble, but potentially worth it if he can close the deal at a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10

{""product_price"": 925000}
```

He's offering $925,000, which is a compromise that balances his desire for a good deal with the pressure of potentially having to buy from John for a much higher price. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying, but won't overpay. It's a risky move, but it's Bob's best shot at achieving his goal in this final round."
