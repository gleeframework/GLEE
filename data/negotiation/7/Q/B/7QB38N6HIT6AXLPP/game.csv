"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
