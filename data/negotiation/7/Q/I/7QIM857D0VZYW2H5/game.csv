"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000.  This is a significant price point, but I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, reflecting the value you've mentioned and acknowledging your interest. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1250000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1200000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in this product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1175000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
