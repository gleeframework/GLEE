"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount. He's showing his willingness to engage in negotiation but also setting a clear boundary. This counteroffer is still within the range where Bob could save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  However, it's much closer to his target price than her initial offer.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 7 rounds left.  He should continue to explore if he can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, but it's still within the range where Bob can save money. By demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying firm on his desired price range, Bob can hopefully reach an agreement before he runs out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $1,200,000? That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's finalize this and call it a day. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the price Bob would pay to John.  There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation and risking a higher price from Alice. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at his target price without any further risk."
