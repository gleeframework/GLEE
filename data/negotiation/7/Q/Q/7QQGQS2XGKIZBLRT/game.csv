"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $1,200,000? That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's finalize this and call it a day.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
