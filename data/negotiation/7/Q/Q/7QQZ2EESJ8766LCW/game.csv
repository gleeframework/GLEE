"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $13,750 is still a bit too low.  How about $14,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
