"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your target price of $15,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for some negotiation.
* **Shows interest:** The message conveys your interest in the product while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  By offering a specific price, you're inviting Alice to respond with either an acceptance or a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This still gives me a fair return and allows you to get a great deal on this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.**  While it's closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **You still have room to negotiate.**  You've shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has also shown flexibility.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice and have a reliable alternative with John.  This gives you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair and realistic:** $10,500 is within your budget and is a reasonable price considering Alice's value for the product.
* **Encouraging a quick decision:** The message emphasizes the potential for a quick and mutually beneficial deal."
