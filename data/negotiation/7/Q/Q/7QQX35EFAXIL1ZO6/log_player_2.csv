"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $50, there's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to explore better options and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer of $30. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a deal at a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $40 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still significantly higher than my desired price range. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get Alice to come down further. I have 7 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $35. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to secure a price closer to my target range.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice and we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $45 is still higher than my ideal price, Alice is clearly not going to budge much further. It's important to remember that I have a limited number of rounds, and there's always the risk that Alice will become stubborn or I'll run out of time.  Buying the product from Alice at $45 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
