"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value you'll get out of this product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,600. I'll meet you at $7,800. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
