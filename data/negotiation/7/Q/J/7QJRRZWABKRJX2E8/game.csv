"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and make a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $10500. I'm willing to make a small adjustment to get closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
