Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because: 

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's higher than your minimum price but lower than Bob's perceived value.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:**  This encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation. 
* **It leaves room for a good deal:** If Bob counters, you have space to negotiate a price closer to $150. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob (and to us!).  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

We'll counter with a price closer to our initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while still keeping a reasonable profit.
* **Clear benefits:** The offer highlights the value of the product and emphasizes that $110 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Pressure for a deal:**  This counteroffer is likely to prompt Bob to make a final decision, as it's closer to our desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is still a bit lower than we'd ideally like, it's getting very close to our desired price point.  We've already shown our willingness to negotiate and Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go much higher.  

Accepting his offer is the best course of action, as we're still getting a decent profit and avoiding the risk of losing the sale entirely."
