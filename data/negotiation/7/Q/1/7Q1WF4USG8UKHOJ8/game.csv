"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair, $1,200,000 is a significant jump down from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $1,325,000.  This is my final offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,325,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
