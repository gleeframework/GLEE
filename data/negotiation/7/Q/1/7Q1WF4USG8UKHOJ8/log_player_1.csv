Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly stuck at $1,200,000.  He's signaled this multiple times and is now hinting at walking away.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better result than John's guaranteed offer.  It makes the most sense to cut losses and sell to John."
