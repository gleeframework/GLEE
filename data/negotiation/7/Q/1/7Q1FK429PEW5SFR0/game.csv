"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another offer. I'd be willing to pay $12800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Bob,4,
