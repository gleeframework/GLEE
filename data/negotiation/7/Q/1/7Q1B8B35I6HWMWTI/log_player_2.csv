"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a perfect fit for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still fair.  Let's say $12,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe you'll find it to be a very valuable asset. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her.** This suggests she might be willing to negotiate further. 
* **You have a better alternative with John.** While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go with John. This gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
