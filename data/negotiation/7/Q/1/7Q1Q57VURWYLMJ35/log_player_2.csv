"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have no information about the value of the product to Alice.  Since you're capped at $1,500,000, there's no incentive to negotiate. Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product at your maximum price point, avoiding any risk of a protracted negotiation that could lead to a higher price."
