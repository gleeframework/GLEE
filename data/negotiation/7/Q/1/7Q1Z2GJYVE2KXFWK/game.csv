"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm confident it will be a fantastic asset for you. My initial price is $1800000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but I need to be more competitive with my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $1500000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price and still allows me to get closer to my target. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1350000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This price recognizes the unique value of this product while also acknowledging your financial limitations. Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and understanding.  $1400000 is a good offer, but I'm just a bit shy of where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1425000 for the product. This will give me the final nudge I need, and you'll still be getting an incredible value for the product. Let's work together to make this happen!",1425000.0,Alice,7,
