"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and it's likely Alice will be willing to lower her price to secure a sale.
* **Buying from John is an option.**  This is a good fallback, but it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her. 
* **Setting the tone:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate aggressively. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still room to negotiate upward in the remaining rounds, but this initial offer puts pressure on Alice to consider your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, you're still not willing to pay $1,100,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already made a counteroffer, and it's likely Alice will be willing to come down further to close the deal.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** But, since you're already in a negotiation with Alice, it makes sense to see if you can get a lower price from her first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting your budget:** This counteroffer finally hits your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Showing commitment:** By offering your top price, you're demonstrating a willingness to buy the product but are still holding firm on your budget.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  Alice knows that this is your final offer, and she'll need to decide whether to accept it or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  You're not willing to pay $1,050,000.
* **There's limited time left.** With only 5 rounds remaining, the chance of further significant price reductions from Alice is diminishing.
* **Buying from John is the best option.**  You've negotiated with Alice, but ultimately, you're not getting a better price than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the deal at your maximum budget."
