"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere in the range of $10,000.  What's the lowest you could go?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $10,000 is significantly below its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I understand this product has specific value to you. Let's settle at $15,500 and call it a deal. This offer reflects my bottom line.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can tell this product means a lot to you and I respect that you have a bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
