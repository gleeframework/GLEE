{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,150,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential concessions.
* **Is within Bob's range:**  $1,150,000 is below Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, making the offer attractive.
* **Shows confidence:**  By offering a price close to my estimated value, I demonstrate that I believe in the product's worth. 

I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential for a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully find a price closer to my target of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair compromise.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired selling point.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This approach:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the previous offer.
* **Highlights value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the potential for a good return on investment.
* **Keeps negotiation open:** This counteroffer provides an opportunity for Bob to reconsider and potentially agree on a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, I'm starting to feel the pressure. The longer the negotiation goes on, the higher the risk of John making a better offer or me simply losing interest in the deal. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale that's only slightly below my target, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation and potentially getting less."
