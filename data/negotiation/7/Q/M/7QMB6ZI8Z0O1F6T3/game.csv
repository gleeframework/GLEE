"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $800,000. However, considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I understand the value is high for you, that price point is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you'll consider this revised offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? Would you be willing to consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a price of $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you'll consider this revised offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
