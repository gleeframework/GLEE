"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000.  This is a significant discount considering its potential worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, my goal is to maximize profit. Since I value the product at $10,000, anything above that is a win. Bob's offer is close, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still interested in the product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $14200. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. At this point, we're getting close to a deal.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal. It also reduces the chance of having to sell to John for the lower price of $10,000."
