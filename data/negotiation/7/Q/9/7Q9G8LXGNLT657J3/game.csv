"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8,100. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
