Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high, but be reasonable:** $14,000 is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a decent profit for me.
* **Be prepared to counteroffer:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be ready to counteroffer with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Be willing to walk away:**  If the negotiations drag on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm prepared to walk away and sell the product to John. This shows Bob that I'm serious and gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget to work with. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I reiterate that I understand Bob's budget constraints, but emphasize that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him.  This keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids appearing inflexible. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** While I'm willing to come down in price, I'm not giving away too much too quickly.  The $13,500 offer leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Keep the door open for John:** I'm still aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, which provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a little above what I can do right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely and ending up with nothing.  

**Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer means I'll make a profit, but it's less than I hoped for.  Rejecting his offer might lead to further negotiation, but it also risks him walking away or needing to sell to John.
* **Time Value of Money:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and could delay my potential profit.  $13,000 is a good amount, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further uncertainty.

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $13,000. This secures a sale and a reasonable profit for me."
