"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,200,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be honest,  $800,000 is my maximum budget for this.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
