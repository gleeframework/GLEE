"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my minimum value and my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum value.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, as I could also sell to John for the same price."
