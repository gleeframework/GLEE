Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, I'm starting at my minimum value of $100. This is my best chance of getting the most money for it. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my minimum with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90,  considering your interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price closer to his initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still trying to secure a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has offered $75, which is still below my minimum value of $100. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already had two rounds of back and forth, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, so selling to him is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
