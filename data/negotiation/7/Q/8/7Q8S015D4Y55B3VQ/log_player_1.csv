Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $950,000 is still above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer isn't too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth and potential compromise. 

Remember, the key is to start high, but leave room for negotiation to maximize your chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired price.  It's better to try and negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $900,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to your desired price.
* **Stay Competitive:**  It's important to remember John's offer of $1,000,000.  This counteroffer keeps the deal with Bob attractive while also protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $875,000 for the product. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $875,000 is still below your minimum desired price.  While it's closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees you reach your desired profit. It's a secure and  profitable outcome."
