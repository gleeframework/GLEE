Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you place on this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a reasonable price, considering we're both aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards finding a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Reason: While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's current offer would be a loss, and there's no guarantee he'll reach $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds. It's strategically sound to take the sure profit now."
