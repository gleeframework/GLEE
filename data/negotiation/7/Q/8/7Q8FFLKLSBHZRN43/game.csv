"Alice, while I appreciate the value you place on this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a reasonable price, considering we're both aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards finding a middle ground.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
