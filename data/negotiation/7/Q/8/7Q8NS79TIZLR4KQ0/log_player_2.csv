"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's asking price ($150) and my maximum budget ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I'm prepared to go higher, but I want to see how Alice responds first. There's always the option to buy from John for $80 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $110 is still significantly higher than my budget of $80 and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to come down from $150 to $110 suggests there might be room for further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still comfortable walking away and buying from John for $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer ($60) and her current offer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards a price I find acceptable.
* **Below Budget:**  $75 keeps me well below my $80 maximum budget. 
* **Pressure Point:** This offer puts a bit more pressure on Alice. It's a reasonable compromise, and she risks losing the sale entirely if she rejects it (since I can go to John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $90, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's final offer of $90 is still above my $80 budget. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer.
* **No More Negotiation:**  Alice has stated that $90 is her final offer, so further haggling is unlikely to be successful."
