"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I'll try to get closer to $115 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. However, considering we've already gone through 4 rounds and there are only 6 left, the time pressure is starting to increase.  It's likely we'll keep going back and forth, and I might not be able to reach a higher price. Therefore, it's more strategic to sell to John now and guarantee the $100."
