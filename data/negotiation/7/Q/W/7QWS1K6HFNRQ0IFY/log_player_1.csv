{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.

This offer is a strong starting point, as it:

* **Creates Urgency:** The wording emphasizes exclusivity and a ""unique chance.""
* **Justifies the Price:**  Highlighting the ""exceptional value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** You're open to potentially lowering the price slightly if Bob negotiates, but still staying above your minimum."
