``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). 
* There's room for negotiation.
* It's better to explore a counteroffer to see if a mutually beneficial price can be reached."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than her value of $1,000,000, meaning there is more room for negotiation.
* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation. 
* There's a potential for a deal closer to Bob's desired price point."
