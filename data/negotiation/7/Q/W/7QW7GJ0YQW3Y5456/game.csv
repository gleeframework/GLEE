"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to your company.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,075,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this at $1,060,000? This keeps us moving closer to a deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
