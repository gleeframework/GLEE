{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $3,000 if he buys it at your asking price. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy it for $8,000, but aiming higher is key.
* **The Strategy:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **The Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and suggesting a ""fair"" deal. This encourages a positive response."
