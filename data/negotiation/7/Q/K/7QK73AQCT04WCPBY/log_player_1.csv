"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, it's still within the realm of negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Selling to John right now would secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 but I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to close the deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. This is a good deal for me, as it is a higher amount than selling to John would yield.  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed, and the risk of a counteroffer failing is increasing with each round.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good profit and move on."
