"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for a negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is still above my minimum and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round.  It's getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes more appealing, so I'm going to be more cautious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

This time I'm offering the product for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to this. If he doesn't, selling to John becomes a very strong option."
