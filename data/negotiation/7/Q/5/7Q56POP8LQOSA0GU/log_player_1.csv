Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, giving me room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic in my message to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is a good compromise. Accepting his offer allows me to quickly sell the product without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
