At this point, Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of the deal, it's getting risky. Accepting the $10,100 offer guarantees a good price without the risk of having to go with John at $12,000."
