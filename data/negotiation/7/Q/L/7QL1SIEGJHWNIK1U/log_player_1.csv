Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $80, so we need to offer it at a price that seems like a good deal to him, while still being profitable for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a strong fallback position. 

By starting high, but just below your guaranteed price with John, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
