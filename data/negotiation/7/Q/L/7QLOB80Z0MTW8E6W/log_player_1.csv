{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I've also made the message friendly and inviting to encourage him to engage in the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $95?  I'm really hoping to get this product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $100.  I'll counter with a price in between."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $95 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100? That's a fair price for a product that you value at $100, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum price, so I'll accept it.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate and risking losing the sale to John."
