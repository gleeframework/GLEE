,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $95?  I'm really hoping to get this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $95 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? That would be a good price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100? That's a fair price for a product that you value at $100, and it's within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
