"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle at this price.",19000.0,Bob,4,
