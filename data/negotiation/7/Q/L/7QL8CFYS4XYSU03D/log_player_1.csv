"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to start with a price that is close to my ideal outcome while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the product's value to Bob, not just my own cost. 
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to him ($120). There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's more fair to both of us.
* **Potential for higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price point.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but it would mean missing out on the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still ensuring I'm getting a fair price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value the product offers Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit he's getting.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($80). However, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for better price:**  I believe there's still room for a small increase in price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm only $5 away from a potentially better deal with Bob.  The risk is worth taking at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($85). This demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" highlighting the mutual benefit of agreeing.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using friendly and encouraging language to keep the negotiation positive and increase the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $87.50. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $82 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. However, we've already gone back and forth several rounds, and it's worth trying to get a little closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm only $2 away from a potentially better deal with Bob. The risk of losing the deal to John is minimal at this point.
* **Potential for agreement:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still a chance to reach an agreement that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference again and go with $84.50? It's a fair compromise and lets us both move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 84.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm again offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($87.50) and Bob's offer ($82). This reinforces my willingness to meet halfway and find a solution we can both agree on.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm highlighting the shared benefit of reaching an agreement, emphasizing ""lets us both move forward.""
* **Positive Language:** I'm using friendly and encouraging language to maintain a positive tone and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $84.50 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and there's a high chance that further negotiation won't lead to a higher price.
* **Equal value:**  John's offer is exactly the same as Bob's final offer.  Since I'm at my minimum acceptable price, there's no real advantage to continuing the negotiation with Bob.
* **Time constraint:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations with Bob."
