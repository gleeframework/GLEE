"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly above the product's worth to you.
* **There are more rounds.** You have time to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer you $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me, and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $750,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and our initial offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down in price, $850,000 is still above your ideal price range.  You have more rounds left, and there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Don't rush the deal:** You're playing a long game to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're not willing to accept $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice is showing flexibility, $825,000 is still outside of your desired price range. You're aiming for a price closer to $800,000.
* **Rounds remain:** You have several rounds left, and there's still potential to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation. 
* **Avoid rushing:** You're focused on saving as much money as possible. Rushing into a deal now could cost you more in the long run."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $825,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise closer to my last offer. I'm willing to go up to $810,000.  This price reflects a genuine effort to bridge the gap between our positions.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 810000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. However, we're not willing to accept $810,000. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $812,500. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and our initial offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $812,500 is very close to your last offer of $810,000 and is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Limited rounds:** You're nearing the end of the negotiations.  Accepting the offer secures the purchase without risking further negotiation.
* **Potential for loss:** If you reject the offer, there's a chance Alice might come back with a higher price, or you might have to go with John's offer, which is significantly more expensive.

While you're still not at your ideal price, accepting the offer in Round 7 is a good strategy to secure the product at a price that's still significantly better than John's offer."
