"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of getting a better price from her in a counter-offer, or you can always fall back on buying from John."
