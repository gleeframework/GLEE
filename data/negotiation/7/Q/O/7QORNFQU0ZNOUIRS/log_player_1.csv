Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product for $1,100,000 allows for a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so a price of $1,100,000 leaves him with a potential $100,000 gain, making it a compelling offer. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. However, maximizing profit with Bob is the priority."
