"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $10,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a price that is significantly lower than its market value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is drastically overselling the product's worth to you. While her offer is slightly below your $10,000 maximum, you can likely negotiate a better price or simply buy it from John for $10,000.  There's a good chance Alice will come back with a lower offer if you reject this one."
