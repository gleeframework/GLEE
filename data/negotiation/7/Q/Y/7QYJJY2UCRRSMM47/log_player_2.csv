"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $125 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer of $110 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $125. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise, but still wants a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $110 is still above Alice's minimum price of $100, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept this offer.
* **Staying within Budget:** This counteroffer remains within Bob's budget of $150, making it a viable option for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down from $125 to $115, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Within Budget:** $115 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, there's also a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers or the negotiation might drag on. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
