Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $15,000 is a significant markup over your minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, which might encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message hints at the product's potential value to Bob, which could make him more interested.

However, remember:

* **Know Your Product:**  How unique is your product? What makes it worth more than $10,000 to you? This will guide your negotiation strategy.
* **Consider Bob:**  What do you know about Bob's financial situation or interest in this type of product? 
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Don't be afraid to counteroffer or walk away if Bob's offers are too low. Remember you can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, but it's still lower than your desired profit margin.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You can counteroffer Bob with a price between $12,000 and your initial offer of $15,000. Aim for a price that reflects your product's value and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Consider Bob's Interest:**  Remember that Bob is interested in the product.  A reasonable counteroffer may lead to a successful deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident it's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Reinforcement:** The message subtly reinforces the product's value by stating that you believe it's worth more than $12,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by suggesting that you're open to further discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $13,500. Accepting this offer means:

* **Good Profit:** You'll earn a profit of $3,000, which is significant considering your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to walk away.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer allows you to finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities. 

While you could potentially squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gain."
