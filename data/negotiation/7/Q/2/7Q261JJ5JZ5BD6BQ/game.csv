"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise, reflecting my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
