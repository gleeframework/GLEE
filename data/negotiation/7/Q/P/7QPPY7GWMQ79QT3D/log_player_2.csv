# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $100 is still a bit higher than your desired price point."

# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. What do you think?

You have three options:
