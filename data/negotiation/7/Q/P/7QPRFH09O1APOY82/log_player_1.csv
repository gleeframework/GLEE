Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum selling price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits to both of us, making it seem like a win-win. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer, leaving space for Bob to counter. 
* **Knowing my fallback:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not overly desperate.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping my goal of maximizing profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial value, his offer is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to push for a better price.
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price further.

While I want to sell the product, I don't want to settle for an offer that significantly undervalues it.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $13,500. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not completely rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also not accepting it.  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting him ""halfway"" between my previous offer and his offer.
* **Reiterate the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is still fair.
* **Focus on win-win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm not making this a final offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my minimum selling price and maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum selling price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While it's not ideal, there's still a chance to potentially increase the price in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing John as a buyer.  John might be waiting for my final decision, and if I continue to negotiate with Bob, John might pull out.

Considering the risk of losing John and the fact that Bob's offer is relatively close to my minimum, I'm willing to accept his offer for now. I'll keep the possibility of further negotiation open, but I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely."
