Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit, which means getting Bob to pay as close to $1,500,000 as possible.

**The Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value.  Here's how:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  I'm offering it at $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By starting at $1,900,000, you anchor the negotiation at a high point. 
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're implying the value is even higher than Bob's estimate.
* **Room to Negotiate:** This price gives you significant space to lower the price during negotiations if Bob pushes back, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for you. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower (but still above $1,500,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, consider a less aggressive opening price. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
