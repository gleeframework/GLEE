"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product while also recognizing its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $700,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  We've done well to negotiate down, but there's no point risking losing the $800,000 deal for a slightly better price with Alice."
