"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product while also recognizing its value to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $700,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
