Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to build a rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $92.50 is a good price and it seems like Bob is firm on that amount.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with only $80 from John."
