Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still more expensive than what John is offering. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
