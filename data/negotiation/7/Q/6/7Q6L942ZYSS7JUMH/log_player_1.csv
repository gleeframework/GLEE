{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal at $12,000, still allowing me to earn more than his perceived value of $10,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
