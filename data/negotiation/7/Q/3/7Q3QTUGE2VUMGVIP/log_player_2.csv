"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for something that's very valuable to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly values the product and wants a fair price, but her offer is still $2,000 more than John's. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
