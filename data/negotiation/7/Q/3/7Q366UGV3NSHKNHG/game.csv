"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around \$6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we split the difference and make it \$7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go to $8,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
