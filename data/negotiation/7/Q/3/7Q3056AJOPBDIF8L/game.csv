"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
