"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $2,000,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its unique benefits.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my best and final offer, I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
