"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get a better price, but I'm still confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $1,062,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500.

Alice is very clearly holding firm on her pricing, and while we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better price than $1,062,500.  Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
