"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $11,500.  It's still a good deal for a product you value at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
