"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is a good deal, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. There's no information on the value of the product to her, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer at $300,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to push Alice to lower her price while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $400,000, which is still a good deal. However, Bob can potentially get an even better price. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and see if Alice will go lower. There's still a significant gap between Bob's counteroffer of $300,000 and Alice's offer of $400,000, indicating room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob increases his counteroffer to $350,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $450,000. While Bob might still be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming unwilling to sell, or Bob losing the product to John.  At this point, $450,000 is a good deal, within Bob's budget, and secures the product.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid potential risks."
