"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your valuation of the product and the value it brings to my business, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This price allows for a healthy profit margin for you and a significant savings for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still above my desired range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value to you, while allowing me a substantial savings.  Let's find common ground and reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I think this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
