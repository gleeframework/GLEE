"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  By rejecting the offer, you can try to lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice. Knowing you have another option gives you leverage."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your valuation of the product and the value it brings to my business, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This price allows for a healthy profit margin for you and a significant savings for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking too much.**  Her counteroffer is still higher than the product's worth to her. There's no reason to accept it just because she compromised a little.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** I can still offer a lower price and hopefully get her to budge. 
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** This gives me the leverage to keep pushing for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I think this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now reasonable.** While still higher than her valuation, it's closer to my desired price and a significant savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Further negotiation might not yield much.** Alice is firm at $1,250,000.  There's a good chance we'll reach a stalemate, and I'll have to buy from John anyway. 
* **It's a good deal overall.**  I'm getting the product for $250,000 less than John's price. 

I'm willing to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price."
