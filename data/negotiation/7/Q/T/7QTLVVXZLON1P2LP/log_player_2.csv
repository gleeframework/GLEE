"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's opening offer is higher than what we're willing to pay and significantly higher than her own valuation. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should try to get a better price.  We'll reject this offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate while aiming for a price that represents a significant saving.  We also frame our counteroffer in a way that expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $90? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down slightly, but we still have room to negotiate. It's clear she's trying to find a middle ground, and $90 is still a significant markup from her $80 valuation.  We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to our target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation of the product. This is a strong negotiating tactic as it offers a price that is fair to both parties, while still leaving us with potential savings compared to John's offer. By framing it as a ""win-win"" situation, we increase the chances of Alice accepting."
