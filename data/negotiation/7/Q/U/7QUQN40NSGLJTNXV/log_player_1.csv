{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to capture as much of the value difference as possible. Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential gain of $150,000, while I secure a significant profit above my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to strike a balance between a price attractive enough for Bob to accept and profitable enough for me.  By leaving some ""meat on the bone"" for Bob, I increase the likelihood of a successful sale at a much higher price than my fallback option."
