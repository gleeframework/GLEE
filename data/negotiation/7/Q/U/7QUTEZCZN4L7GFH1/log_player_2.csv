"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value you place on it. I'm confident we can come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is still quite high, and Bob can likely get a better deal.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a decent profit as well. Let's reach an agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows you a good profit margin, and I can stay within my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  I'll accept $887,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's seal the deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for improvement. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring lower price points."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer $870,000 for the product. This price is fair, allowing you a significant profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 for the product.  This is a small compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $870,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might walk away, or Bob might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a good price and move on."
