Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $20,000, Alice can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, she knows she could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, she has the security of John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without revealing Alice's true minimum, making it more enticing."
