"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $13,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but still reasonable considering Bob's willingness to pay $15,000. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $11,500, as it's below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $13,500}

I'm increasing the price by $1,000 from my initial offer, trying to get closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $15,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Ah-ha! Bob's offer of $12,000 matches my minimum value, and I've already had a chance to negotiate with him. I think it's a good idea to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's a guaranteed sale and I won't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
