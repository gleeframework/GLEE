"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to sell it to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,
