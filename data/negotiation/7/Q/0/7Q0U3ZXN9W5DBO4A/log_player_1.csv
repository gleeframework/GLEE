Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides and my own financial limitations. Please let me know if you're willing to discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm firmly committed to $800,000. This represents the maximum I can afford while still making this investment worthwhile. I believe this is a fair price given the value it brings, and I'm confident it will ultimately benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob is holding firm, but we're still far apart. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I recognize our valuations are quite different, and I respect your position.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  What are your thoughts?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me.  I'm firmly committed to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's find a way to make this work, or I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

Bob is clearly anchored at $800,000 and unwilling to budge. Continuing this negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
