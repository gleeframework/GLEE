"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13250? I'm confident this price is still beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and then increasing her price again, or ultimately choosing to not sell to Bob at all, is higher than the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, and avoids any further negotiation risks."
