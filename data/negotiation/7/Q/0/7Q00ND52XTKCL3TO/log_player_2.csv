"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110.
* You can potentially save money by negotiating further. 
* It's too early to buy from John, as you haven't even explored your options with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* Alice's product is worth $100 to her, so she's likely to be willing to accept a price slightly above that.
* This gives me room to potentially negotiate further if Alice rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is offering a higher price than my previous counteroffer. 
* While I'm willing to pay $120,  I want to continue negotiating to try and lower the price further.
* I still have time to reach a better agreement before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $115, which is getting closer to my maximum price.
* I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* This is a reasonable price considering Alice is willing to sell for $100 and I'm willing to pay up to $120.
* I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as she's shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, it's still above my preferred range.
* I'm willing to pay up to $120, but I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a lower price.
* I have a few more rounds left, so I'm not ready to buy from John yet. 
* I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $117.5, which is very close to my maximum price.
* I'm offering $115, which is a compromise and represents a reasonable price for both parties.
* Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and I believe she's likely to accept this offer.
* I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be prepared to close the deal if Alice rejects my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are at the seventh round and Alice's offer is now $118.
*  We are running out of rounds and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.
*  While $118 is still below my maximum price, it's not much lower than John's offer, and I don't want to risk another round and potentially have to pay even more.
*  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it means paying a bit more than I initially hoped."
