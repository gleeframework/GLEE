"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $100 from John.  There's no need to accept Alice's offer of $85 right now.  There's a good chance that Bob can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his limit as possible. Starting at $75 gives him room to negotiate if Alice rejects the offer, but still significantly lowers the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to pay as little as possible.  While $90 is closer to his limit than $100, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. At $80, he's still below his limit of $100, and there's a chance Alice will accept, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although $95 is close to Bob's limit, he still has a few rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit further, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise. At $85, he's still within his budget and is pushing closer to Alice's desired price.  There's a chance she will accept, especially if she doesn't want to risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is at Bob's maximum limit.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiations. Bob has reached his limit and can buy the product from John at the same price. Since both options are the same price, it makes sense to buy from John and save time."
