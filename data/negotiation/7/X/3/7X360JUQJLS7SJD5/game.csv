"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, and I'm interested in the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value the product offers, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
