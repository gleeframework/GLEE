,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's try to work something out.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $990,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,020,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
