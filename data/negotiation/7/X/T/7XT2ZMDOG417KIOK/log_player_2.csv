"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's start the negotiation. Alice's initial offer is way too high. We have plenty of room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - start low to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. We're aiming to get the price closer to our $80 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still above our target price and our fallback option. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $70? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're getting closer!  We're increasing our offer, but still staying well below our maximum budget. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $110 on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a price that might be acceptable, but we're still not quite there. We'll keep pushing a little further, but we need to be mindful that John's offer is becoming more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying hard to find a price that works for both of us.  $90 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're nudging the price up slightly, demonstrating willingness to compromise, but staying firm below our $80 walk-away point. This round will be crucial in determining if we can get a better deal from Alice or if we should go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly and is offering the product for $85. While it's slightly above John's $80 offer, it's still a reasonable price and within our $80 budget.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it."
