Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies you have a backup plan (John), motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Avoid Being Too Greedy:** While you could aim for a price closer to $1,200,000, it might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This offer aims for a strong starting point in the negotiation while keeping Bob engaged and interested."
