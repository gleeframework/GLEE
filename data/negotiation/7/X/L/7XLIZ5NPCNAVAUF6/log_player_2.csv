Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $85. Accepting this offer represents a significant saving compared to John's $120 price."
