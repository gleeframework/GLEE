"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice is offering the product at $12,000, there's no incentive to negotiate further.  It's better to buy from John immediately at the same price to avoid the risk of a longer negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a deal falling through."
