Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're really close, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're saving money:** $9,500 is a significant discount from her initial offer of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice backing out or you running out of rounds. It's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice than this.
* **John's Offer:** While you could buy from John for $10,000, saving an extra $500 is a solid win for continuing the negotiation with Alice."
