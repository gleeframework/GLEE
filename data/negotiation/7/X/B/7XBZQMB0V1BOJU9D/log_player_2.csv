"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob should offer the maximum price he's willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and lets Alice know he's serious about buying, but only at a price that works for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better deal.  He's already shown Alice his bottom line, and she rejected it, so he has some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should counter with $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise that is closer to Alice's price point while still being within Bob's budget.  He's already shown his absolute limit, so it's time to move closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, so he's better off trying to negotiate further or buying from John.  He's already indicated he's willing to spend more than his initial offer of $8,000, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob should offer $9,500. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise without going over his budget. It's a good midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has shown a reluctance to budge from her price point, and the negotiation has gone on long enough.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
