I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal, considering the product's value to him. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer a higher price, it's close enough to my target that I'm willing to close the deal. This ensures a decent profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
