"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. I understand its significance and would like to offer it to you at a special price tailored to our mutual benefit. After careful consideration, I propose to sell the product to you for $950,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I believe this offer presents an excellent chance for you to secure an asset that could potentially grow in value over time. Please let me know if you require any further information or wish to discuss this proposal in more detail. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice saves Bob money:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than the $1,200,000 Bob would pay John. 
* **The product is still valuable to Bob:** Even at $950,000, the product is worth more to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to Alice ($800,000). 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option for Bob."
