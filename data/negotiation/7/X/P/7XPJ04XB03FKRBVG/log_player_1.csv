"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer if he's willing to pay more than $100 but less than $120. If he rejects, I can keep negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer $120, accepting $110 is a good compromise. It's more than Bob's initial valuation and still allows for a profitable sale."
