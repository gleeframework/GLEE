"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject the offer. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so she can't expect to get $1,200,000 for it. I will wait for a better offer or buy it from John for $1,500,000.
