Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000, so I can't go lower.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John.
* **Bob's value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** By offering $1,100,000, I'm leaving a significant amount of profit for Bob, making the offer appealing.  It's likely he'll be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value to get the product.

**This strategy:**

* Maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* Reduces the risk of Bob rejecting my offer, as it's still a significant value proposition for him."
