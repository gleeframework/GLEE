"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but it's a compromise showing my willingness to negotiate.  It's also a good midpoint between my minimum and his offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm only four rounds in, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm counteroffering at $135.  This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, but I'm determined to get at least $150 for the product.  I have the option to sell to John for that price, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  There are only a few rounds left, so I'm trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  We are down to the last few rounds, and it seems like Bob and I are not going to be able to reach a deal. I am confident that I can get $150 from John, so I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and accept his offer."
