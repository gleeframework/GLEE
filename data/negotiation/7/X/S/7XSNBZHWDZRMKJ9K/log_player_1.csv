Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this product is a great opportunity for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. However, I need to stay within my budget, and $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
