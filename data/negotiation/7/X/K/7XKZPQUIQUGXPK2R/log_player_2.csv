Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your position. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm willing to compromise slightly further.  Let's settle this at $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my target price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise further, or I might run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid unnecessary risk."
