Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $120.  It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 gives Bob a perceived discount while still securing a significant profit for you. It's a win-win scenario within the negotiation range. 

**Why not higher?**

While you could try a higher price, it risks Bob rejecting the offer.  It's a balance between potential profit and the certainty of John's offer."
