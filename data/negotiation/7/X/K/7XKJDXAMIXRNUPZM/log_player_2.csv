"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my desired price, I want to see if I can push for an even lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500? That's a good price for you, and it's within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. I've already tried negotiating, and she's unwilling to budge much further.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, especially when I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for my desired price. Buying from John now ensures I get the product at my target price and avoids any further haggling."
