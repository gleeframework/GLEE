Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500? That's a good price for you, and it's within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!
