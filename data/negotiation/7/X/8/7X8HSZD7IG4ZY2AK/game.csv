"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is just too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you even more than your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $12,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
