"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm hoping to stay within my budget, and this would be a good compromise for us both.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
