Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a profit above my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is still fair to both of us, and it's more appealing than selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum desired amount of $120 and  higher than selling to John. Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away entirely is too high at this point."
