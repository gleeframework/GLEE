**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's made it clear that $1,300,000 is his absolute limit.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed way to secure a good price without further negotiation and potential for Bob to walk away. 

While selling to Bob for $1,300,000 would be ideal, the risk of him not moving any higher makes selling to John the safer and more profitable option in the long run."
