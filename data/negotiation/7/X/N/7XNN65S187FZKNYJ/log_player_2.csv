Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $800,000?  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase the product from John for that price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have two options: 

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This will get you the product for $815,000, which is slightly more than your target price of $800,000.
2. **Buy from John:** This will guarantee you the product for $800,000, your target price.

Since you are looking to save as much money as possible, and you have a guaranteed alternative at your target price, the best decision is to **buy from John**."
