"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product could be valuable but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is attractive, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm still having trouble justifying that price point.  Could you do $1,150,000?  That would be a great place for us to land.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
