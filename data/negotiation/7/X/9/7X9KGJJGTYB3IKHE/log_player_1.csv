"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially gets a deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can come to a better agreement. I would like to offer $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price, and I've already gone down to my minimum.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him when I can get the same price from John."
