{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $80, but lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is close to my desired profit margin, and significantly better than selling to John for $80.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
