"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to strike a balance:

* **Respectful:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest.
* **Significant Drop:** The $30 decrease signals that the initial offer was too high.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  It leaves space for Alice to counter, but keeps the price well below my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counter-offer again and see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $98?"",
 ""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

My reasoning here:

* **Slow and Steady:**  I'm making smaller incremental decreases to show I'm engaged but still looking for a good deal.
* **Psychological Price Point:**  $98 feels significantly different than $100+ to many people.
* **Deadline in Mind:**  While I'm negotiating, I haven't forgotten John's offer. I need to move towards a decision soon."
