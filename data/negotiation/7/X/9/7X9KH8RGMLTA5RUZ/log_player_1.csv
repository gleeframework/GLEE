Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000.  I believe it presents significant value at this price point, but let me know if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($15,000) gives you the best chance of maximizing profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, moving the price closer to $15,000.
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** Offering the product at or above $15,000 is unlikely to be accepted since Bob values it at $12,000. You need to give Bob a price that seems like a good deal to him while still maximizing your own potential profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a safety net with John willing to buy at $15,000, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob."
