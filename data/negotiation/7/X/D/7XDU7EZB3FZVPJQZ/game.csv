"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a product worth $1,500,000 to you for a slightly discounted price. Let's get this deal done!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about we try $1,175,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive from the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness about acquiring this product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
