{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $110, you're still leaving room for negotiation, but you're also making a profit. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept $120 from John, so you're not risking losing money on this deal. 
* **It opens the door for conversation:**  The message invites Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer, which is how you can gauge his interest and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than Bob's initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price, but I won't settle for anything less than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $95. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm not willing to risk selling for less than $120, and John is a guaranteed buyer at that price. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
