Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. Would you like to make an offer on this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,400,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  We can likely find a middle ground between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure $1000000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm going to propose $1200000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,200,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm going to propose $1300000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. I've already gone as far as I'm willing to go.  It's time to move on to John and secure the product for $800,000."
