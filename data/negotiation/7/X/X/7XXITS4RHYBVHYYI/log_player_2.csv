You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, this product holds significant value beyond the market price due to its unique features. I could consider letting it go for $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer.

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $850,000.  While closer to your ideal price, it's still above your upper limit and you have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the better deal with John."
