"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. Would you consider a lower price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, this product holds significant value beyond the market price due to its unique features. I could consider letting it go for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
