"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting high to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if I can find a price that's closer to my initial value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.  It's possible Bob is willing to go a little higher.  We've established a negotiation pattern, and I'm not quite ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I think there's still some room for negotiation.  This offer shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to give in just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  While I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, we're at a stalemate.  Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $12,000, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't think I have time to convince him to change his mind. It's not worth risking losing the sale entirely. John's offer is my minimum, and it's guaranteed."
