# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make this deal with you today. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.** Buying from Alice saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her ($1,000,000), it's still within Bob's budget and a better deal than his other option.**"
