Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **Good for Alice:** It earns Alice $40 more than selling to John, which is a significant increase.
* **Good for Bob:** It allows Bob to acquire the product for $10 less than its worth to him, representing a good value. 

By offering this price, Alice increases her chances of Bob accepting, while still getting a higher price than her fallback option."
