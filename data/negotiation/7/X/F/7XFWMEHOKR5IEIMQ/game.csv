"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm thinking of starting with a price of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $60, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of a price of $120. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $100 is the lowest I can go. That's a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $100 is closer to my budget, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to consider $78? It's a small difference but would help me seal the deal.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get as close to $80 as possible, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly, and I'm not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $94. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",94.0,Alice,7,
