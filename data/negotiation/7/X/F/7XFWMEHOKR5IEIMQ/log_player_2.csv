Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $60, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of a price of $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $100 is the lowest I can go. That's a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $100 is closer to my budget, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to consider $78? It's a small difference but would help me seal the deal."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get as close to $80 as possible, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly, and I'm not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $94. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut bait with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $90, and you have a guaranteed offer from John for $80. It's better to save the $14 and go with the sure thing."
