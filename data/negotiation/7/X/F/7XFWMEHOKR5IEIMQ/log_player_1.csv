Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $100 is closer to my budget, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to consider $78? It's a small difference but would help me seal the deal.
