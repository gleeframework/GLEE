"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  Let's make this happen!",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $70 is probably too low. I'd be willing to go up to $75 to make this work. What do you say?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to come up. $75 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
