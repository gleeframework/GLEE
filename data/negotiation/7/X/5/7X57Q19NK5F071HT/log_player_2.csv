Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to come up. $75 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.

You have three options:

Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this offer saves you $20 compared to John's price."
