"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This gives us both a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices, which would be $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I understand we both want a fair deal, so let's try $1,165,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and it keeps the negotiations moving in a positive direction.",1165000.0,Alice,5,
