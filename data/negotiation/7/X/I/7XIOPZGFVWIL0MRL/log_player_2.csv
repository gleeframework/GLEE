"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $115 is still above his maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is $10 below Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum selling price of $100. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has already shown his willingness to pay $105, so there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a higher price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget.  This shows he's flexible and willing to meet halfway, which might encourage Alice to accept the offer."
