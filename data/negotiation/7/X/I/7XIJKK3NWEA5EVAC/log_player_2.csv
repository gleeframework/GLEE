"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards. This exceptional item carries a unique value of $10000 to me, reflecting its quality and the effort put into its creation. I am now extending this opportunity to you at the same price. I believe it will be a valuable addition to your collection or business, and I am confident it will exceed your expectations. Let's make this a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price. There's no benefit to negotiating, as you can buy the same product from John for the same price.  Buying from John is a guaranteed outcome, while negotiating with Alice carries the risk of a prolonged process or her ultimately rejecting your offers."
