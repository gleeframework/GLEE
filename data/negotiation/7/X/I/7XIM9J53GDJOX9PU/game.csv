"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the market value I've researched. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However,  the product has unique value to me which influences its price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This reflects a more realistic compromise considering its true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
