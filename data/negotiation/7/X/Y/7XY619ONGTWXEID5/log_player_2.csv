"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step towards Bob's desired price point, while still leaving some room for further negotiation. It's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue trying to secure a lower price. He can counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his ideal price or potentially pushing Alice to accept his previous offer of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit tight on budget, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  That's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a subtle increase from Bob's previous offer, showcasing his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. It also demonstrates Bob's commitment to reaching an agreement, encouraging Alice to consider this offer more seriously.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, ideally getting as close to Bob's maximum budget as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still a bit higher than $10,750, but to show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating. At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially getting caught in a prolonged negotiation with Alice that could ultimately lead to a higher price."
