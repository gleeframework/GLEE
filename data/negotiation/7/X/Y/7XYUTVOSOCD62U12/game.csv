"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm happy with that price.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  However, I'm still willing to go a little lower than my initial offer. How about $11,000? That gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If you're open to this offer, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,4,
