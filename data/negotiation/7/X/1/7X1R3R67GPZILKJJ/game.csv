,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105 again. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $108 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but $110 is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,5,
