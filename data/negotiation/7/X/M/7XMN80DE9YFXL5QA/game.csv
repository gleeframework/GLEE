"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
