Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so there's no risk of walking away empty-handed. This allows you to aim high with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, even though we don't know the specifics.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started at a lower price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you absolutely need to sell the product above $1,000,000, a slightly lower initial offer might be more prudent."
