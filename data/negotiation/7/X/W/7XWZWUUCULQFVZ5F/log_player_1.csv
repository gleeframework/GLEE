I am starting with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while still staying significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value but am only able to offer $160 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is quite close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have some room to negotiate.

""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $160 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $180?"",

I am aiming for a price that is still comfortably above my minimum while acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would $170 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can still squeeze out a few more dollars.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I can do $175, but that's my absolute lowest."",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

This message aims to:

* **Maintain a positive tone:** Using phrases like ""You drive a hard bargain"" keeps the negotiation lighthearted.
* **Establish a firm boundary:**  Stating ""$175, but that's my absolute lowest"" signals to Bob that this is my final offer.
* **Encourage closure:**  By offering a final price, I'm pushing for Bob to make a decision."
