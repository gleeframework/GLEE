"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm excited to discuss the price. However, $850000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $775000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825000. This reflects a compromise on my part while still acknowledging the product's value.  I believe this offer is fair and allows us to move forward. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,
