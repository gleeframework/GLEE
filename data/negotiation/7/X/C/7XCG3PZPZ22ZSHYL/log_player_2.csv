"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to you. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, is priced at $950,000. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, hence I believe this price offers a fair compromise while maximizing the value for me. Should you find this proposal acceptable, please let me know, and we can proceed to finalize the details. If not, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $800,000. Thank you for considering this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a false sense of urgency by mentioning another interested party (John) willing to buy at her valuation. This is a tactic to pressure you into accepting a higher price.
* You know you can get the product from John for $1,200,000. While this is your absolute maximum, there's room to negotiate with Alice further.
* By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. 

**Strategy:**  Wait and see if Alice comes back with a lower offer. If her next offer is still too high, you can always fall back on buying from John."
