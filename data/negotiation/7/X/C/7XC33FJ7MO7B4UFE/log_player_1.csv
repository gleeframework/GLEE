"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate upwards.  I'll also be watching for any signs that he might be willing to pay a premium to avoid going to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to compromise and meet me halfway.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good price, but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to push for a higher price, we're already in round 4 and  $920,000 is a very good deal. There's a risk that further negotiations could drag on and I might end up with a lower price, or even having to sell to John for $800,000.  This is a good compromise and I'm happy to close the deal."
