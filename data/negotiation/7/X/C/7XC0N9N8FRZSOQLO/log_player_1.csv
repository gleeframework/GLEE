"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to consider Bob's willingness to negotiate. This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers and ultimately a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm focused on Bob right now, I'm aware of John's offer. This keeps me motivated to find a deal with Bob within the 10 rounds, but also provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation is key:** I want to see if I can get Bob to compromise further. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have 8 rounds to reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **John's offer is the fallback:**  I'm comfortable rejecting this offer knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 option.  

I'm going to counter-offer and aim for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving significantly closer to Bob's offer of $9,000 but still considerably higher. 
* **Incentivizing Bob:**  This price point is likely attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially if he's serious about buying the product.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  There's still some room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer in the next round.  I am not committing to a final price yet. 

My goal is to find a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my initial target while still encouraging Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $13,000. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if it means getting closer to my ideal outcome. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to make progress quickly. However, I believe I can secure a better price if I keep negotiating.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to be assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by increasing my offer slightly, but still staying within a range I'm comfortable with. 
* **Signaling willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob I'm serious about finding a deal, and I'm willing to adjust my price.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a benchmark to evaluate Bob's next counteroffer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept or at least come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is the highest yet, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth ($15,000).
* **Time pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the clock is ticking. I need to be more decisive. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a real risk that I won't be able to get a higher offer from Bob.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John gives me the freedom to be more assertive in negotiations. 

I will counter-offer with a price closer to $10,000, aiming for a quick agreement that's more beneficial to me.  If Bob rejects it, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** I'm making one last attempt to get Bob to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Closing the gap:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **High stakes:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on. I'm taking a gamble and hoping Bob will accept. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, knowing that his offer will be significantly higher. 

This counteroffer is my final push for a deal with Bob. If he doesn't accept, I'll be ready to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the negotiation window is closing. I need to be decisive.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  The price is still significantly lower than what I want for the product.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is far better than what Bob is offering. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's a high chance that I won't be able to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob at a higher price, it's more important for me to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm confident that selling to John is the best choice at this point."
