Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's closer to my minimum desired price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust it based on his counteroffer, or choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to reach an agreement."
