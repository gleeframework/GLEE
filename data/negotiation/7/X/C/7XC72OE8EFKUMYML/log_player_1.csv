Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum value. I'm confident that Bob will be interested since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer and try to find a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,250,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I believe this price is reasonable, considering the product's value to Bob and my own minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While it's closer than his first offer, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to accept this price, as he values the product at the same amount.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
