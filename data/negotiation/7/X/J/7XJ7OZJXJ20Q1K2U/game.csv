"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. ",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go above $14,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $15,500, which would be $12,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12750.0,Bob,4,
