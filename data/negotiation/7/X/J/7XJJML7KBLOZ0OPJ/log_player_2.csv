Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm not comfortable with a price that's significantly lower than my initial offering. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $1,425,000?  This price is still within a reasonable range, considering the product's value to both of us.
