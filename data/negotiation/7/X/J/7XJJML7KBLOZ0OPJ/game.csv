"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm not comfortable with a price that's significantly lower than my initial offering. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $1,425,000?  This price is still within a reasonable range, considering the product's value to both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your latest proposal carefully, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet your price of $1,425,000. I'm hoping for a price closer to my budget of $1,350,000. Considering the value you're providing, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
