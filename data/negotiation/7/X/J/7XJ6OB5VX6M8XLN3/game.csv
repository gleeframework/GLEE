"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise.

"Bob, I understand that $875,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm thinking of a price of $890,000, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer but closer to your offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.
