"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater, especially considering its long-term potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects my strong belief in the product and its ability to generate significant returns for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
