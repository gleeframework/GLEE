"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater, especially considering its long-term potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects my strong belief in the product and its ability to generate significant returns for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
