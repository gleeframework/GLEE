"I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I believe a price closer to $1350000 would better reflect the product's value and the potential benefits it holds for you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price that acknowledges the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
