"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Value Statement:** I'm framing the product as ""fantastic"" to pique Bob's interest and highlight its potential value.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm willing to negotiate by saying ""Let me know what you think."" 
* **Knowing the Exit Strategy:** I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  There's room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a Backstop:**  The option to sell to John for $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum threshold, showing willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Seeking a Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach, aiming to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10500.  This is a fair compromise and would allow me to purchase the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum threshold of $10,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting this offer means I can secure a profit sooner rather than risking further negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Even though this deal is just slightly above my minimum, the option to sell to John for $10,000 provides a buffer in case this deal falls through."
