"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to get closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the value, I can't accept anything less than $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,6,
