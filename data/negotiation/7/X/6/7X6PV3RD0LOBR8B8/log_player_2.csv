"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've carefully nurtured and it's ready to be taken to the next level.  I'm confident it has the potential to be worth even more than its current value to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a price that reflects its true potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **You save money:** Buying from Alice saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, the fact that she's willing to sell it for $1,150,000 indicates a potential for profit for you.  It's always better to get a deal, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
