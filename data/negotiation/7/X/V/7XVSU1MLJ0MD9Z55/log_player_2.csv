Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,187,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,175,000? This price is right in the middle of our last two offers and represents a fair compromise. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is our final chance to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,175,000 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to pay John's full price."
