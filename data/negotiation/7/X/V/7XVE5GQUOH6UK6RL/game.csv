"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. I understand this is as low as you're willing to go, but I need to make this work on my end.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $820,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $815,000. That's the best I can do.",815000.0,Alice,7,
