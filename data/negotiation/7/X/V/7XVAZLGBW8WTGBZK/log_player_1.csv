Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it could be very valuable to you.  How does $18,000 sound?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer gives Bob room to negotiate down if he finds it too high. This way, I can potentially still secure a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value to Bob:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob, I'm hoping to increase his perceived worth of the product, making him more likely to accept a higher price."
