"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $110.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
