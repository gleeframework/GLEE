"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This price reflects its value to me, and I hope it's a starting point for further discussion.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
