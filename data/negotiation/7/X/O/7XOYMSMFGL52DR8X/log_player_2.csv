"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to get the sale, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget of $10,000. He starts by offering $10,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate. The offer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. However, it's only $500 more than what Bob offered in the previous round.  Given the potential for further negotiations, it's likely Bob won't be able to secure a significantly better price. Accepting the offer is the best option in this scenario, as it allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking further haggling and potentially losing the deal."
