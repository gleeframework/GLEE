"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $11,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This keeps it closer to its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is within Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's a better price than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or the possibility of Alice rejecting further counteroffers."
