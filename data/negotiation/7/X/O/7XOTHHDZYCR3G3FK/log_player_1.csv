Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This keeps it closer to its true value."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
