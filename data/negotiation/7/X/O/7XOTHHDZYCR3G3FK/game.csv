"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This keeps it closer to its true value.",10250.0,Alice,3,
