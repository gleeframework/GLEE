Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation, as it's a bit lower than my minimum value for the product, but still higher than what it's worth to Bob. This gives him an incentive to accept, while also allowing for a potential counteroffer."
