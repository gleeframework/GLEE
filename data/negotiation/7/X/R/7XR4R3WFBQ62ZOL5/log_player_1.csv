Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm confident it's a price that reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor.  This makes the final offer seem like a better deal in comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message implies there's room for negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have another buyer (John) provides implicit leverage in the negotiation.  

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** By potentially securing a price much higher than Bob's initial valuation.
2. **Secure a Sale:** While still leaving room to negotiate downwards if Bob shows resistance, ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
