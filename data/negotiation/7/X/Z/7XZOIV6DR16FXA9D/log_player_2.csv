"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his budget of $10,000.  He should attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $16,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. He should continue negotiating to get a better price."
