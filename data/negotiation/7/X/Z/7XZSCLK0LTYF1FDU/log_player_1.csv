"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $810,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $810,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I have 8 rounds left and I want to try and squeeze more value out of Bob's interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your potential profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counteroffer at $860,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is just above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and we are already in round 4.  It's not a bad deal, and there's a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $800,000."
