Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate, but also leaving me a good profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to start the negotiation on a positive note.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great!  I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and aim to negotiate a price closer to my target of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation stalls:**  If I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll  stop and sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Selling to John at $8,000 would be a better option right now.
* **Negotiation potential:**  However, Bob is interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get him to come closer to my target price of $10,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'll try to be reasonable, but won't go below my minimum acceptable price.  
* If Bob continues to refuse, I'll likely sell to John to avoid risking further negotiation losses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message is still positive and encourages further discussion, keeping the door open for a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great!  We've successfully negotiated a price that benefits both of us.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If it's too low, I'll likely sell to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,500. How about we meet at $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price Reached:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Significant Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, especially since John is willing to pay the same amount.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid any further potential losses.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to my next business opportunity."
