"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your initial offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $9,500 for the product. I'm trying to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay above my minimum price of $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand you need to make a profit, but I have a hard limit of $8,000.  Take it or leave it.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have a hard limit, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $9,200 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",9200.0,Alice,7,
