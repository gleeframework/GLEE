I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects the offer, I'm confident I can still sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to what I want, but I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer him and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer, but still keeps me above my minimum selling price.  Hopefully, he'll see the value and accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
