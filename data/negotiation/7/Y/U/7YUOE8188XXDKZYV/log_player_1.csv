Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is above your minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges that Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice.  How about $108?  I'm trying to stay on a bit of a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my desired price and only $2 less than my previous counteroffer.  It's a good deal for both of us.  I'll accept his offer."
