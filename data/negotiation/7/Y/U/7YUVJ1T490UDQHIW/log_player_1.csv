"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm opening with a high price, aiming for a significant chunk of the value gap between our valuations. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Risk mitigation:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still far from the value I know the product holds for Bob.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain leverage and can potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option:** I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and John provides a safety net if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counteroffer still keeps the price above my minimum while leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a quick agreement. 
* **Still better than John's offer:**  Even if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to cave in."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to continue negotiating.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping the price above his previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to apply some pressure. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching a deal but also that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my target price.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me halfway or if he's simply trying to push the price down as much as possible.
* **John remains a viable option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to sell to John, which provides a fallback if the negotiation falls apart."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm making a substantial concession, moving closer to Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a strong desire to reach a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds left:**  We're in the final stages of negotiation, and I still believe there's room for improvement.
* **Significant value gap:**  The remaining value gap is substantial, and I'm not ready to give up on earning a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** With only two rounds left, I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. 
* **John remains a viable option:**  If this round doesn't work out, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum profit.

**This is a high-stakes decision with significant risk.  There's a chance that Bob might not accept my counteroffer, forcing me to sell to John. However, I'm willing to take this risk for the possibility of securing a higher price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:**  This is my final offer, and it's a compromise. It shows my willingness to close the deal, but also reflects my remaining desire for a good price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  This offer is still above my minimum price, but if Bob rejects it, I'm left with the decision to sell to John.  This is a risk, but it's a calculated one based on the remaining value gap and the limited rounds. 
* **High stakes:** With only one round left, there's no room for further negotiation. Bob needs to decide quickly.
* **Final negotiation:**  I'm confident that this price is fair and potentially appealing to Bob, given his eagerness to acquire the product.  

It's a gamble, but I believe it's a gamble worth taking."

Round 10

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final round:**  This is the last round of negotiation.
* **Low offer:**  Bob's offer is below my desired price and the final counteroffer I made in the previous round.
* **Risk of no deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, we reach a stalemate, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to Bob completely.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Decision:**  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John ensures a secure profit and provides a better outcome than rejecting Bob's final offer and potentially getting nothing."
