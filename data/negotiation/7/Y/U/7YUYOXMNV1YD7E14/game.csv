"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also want to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $10,000 is the highest I can go right now. This would still give you a decent profit, and would allow me to make the purchase work financially. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I want to make this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I need to get from this sale. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
