Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high offer will give you insight into his level of interest and flexibility. He might counter-offer, giving you a better understanding of his price range.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer. If Bob rejects your initial offer or negotiations fall through, you can confidently sell to John without losing money. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he seems hesitant, you can gradually lower the price while still aiming to get as close to $20,000 as possible.  Remember, any price above $15,000 is a win in this scenario."
