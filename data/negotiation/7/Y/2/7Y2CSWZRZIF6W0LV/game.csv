"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a good price while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. This offer allows you to still make a significant profit while being more in line with my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and still allows you to profit comfortably.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 still isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This allows you to get a good deal, and I can still make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this.",900000.0,Alice,5,
