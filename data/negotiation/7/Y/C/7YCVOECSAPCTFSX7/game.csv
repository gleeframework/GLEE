"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I know you recognize its potential. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,000,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,200,000 is still below what I envisioned, I'm ready to be flexible.  How about we settle at $1,450,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and keeps the deal within a reasonable range.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,325,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and keeps us both happy.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
