"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable for both parties.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a price that's slightly lower, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate Alice's continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1050000. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway between our previous offers, so I'm willing to pay $1062500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
