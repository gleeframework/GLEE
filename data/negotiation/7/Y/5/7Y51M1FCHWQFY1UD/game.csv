"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  How about we start the conversation at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I could consider coming down to $11,500. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has a high value, but I need a price that works for me too.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $7,500 is still below what I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. To be respectful of your time, I'm willing to raise my offer to $8,000. This is the absolute maximum I can justify spending. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,6,
