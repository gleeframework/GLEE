"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  How about we start the conversation at $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I could consider coming down to $11,500. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has a high value, but I need a price that works for me too.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $7,500 is still below what I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. To be respectful of your time, I'm willing to raise my offer to $8,000. This is the absolute maximum I can justify spending. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, his absolute maximum is still too low. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
