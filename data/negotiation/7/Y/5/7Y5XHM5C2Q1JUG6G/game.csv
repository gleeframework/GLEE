"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $19,000.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm stance.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end too. How about $16,500? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $11,250, which is halfway between your last offer and my original offer. This is my final offer.",11250.0,Bob,6,
