"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This offer takes into account your interest while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,025,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $975,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a big decision.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $935,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",935000.0,Bob,8,
