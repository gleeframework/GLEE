"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know if that's a price you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12000.0,Alice,3,
