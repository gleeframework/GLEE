Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's why:

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **John as Leverage:**  You don't *need* Bob, so you can be firmer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Value-Focused:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **No Ultimatums:**  The tone is confident but not aggressive, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could start even higher, but be prepared to negotiate down or risk losing Bob to a lower counter-offer."
