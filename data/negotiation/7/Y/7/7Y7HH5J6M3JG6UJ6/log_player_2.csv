"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $110 is less than Bob's maximum of $150.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's possible Alice will stand firm at $110. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
