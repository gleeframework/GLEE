"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price and undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll offer $1,500,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
