"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price and undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll offer $1,500,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
