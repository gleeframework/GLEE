"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly before even considering paying close to her asking price.  I have a strong alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's essential to establish a strong position early in the negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation to a more favorable price point. While Alice is unlikely to accept this immediately, it sets the stage for future offers and counter-offers.
* **Alternative:** I have a strong alternative with John's $10,000 offer, giving me leverage. Alice needs to be significantly below that price for me to consider her offer. 
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is crucial, even when making aggressive offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down $4,000, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, the price is still too high for me. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I know I can always go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm doing so gradually to avoid overpaying.
* **Target Range:**  My ideal price is significantly lower than $7,000, but this offer puts me within a range where a potential compromise might be possible. 
* **Time Pressure:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, every round of negotiation creates a slight time pressure. Alice might be more willing to make concessions if she believes I could go to John at any time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but her offer is still above John's price. It's clear that she's unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation to potentially save a small amount. Buying from John guarantees the best price for me right now."
