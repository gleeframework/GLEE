"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $1400000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise,  but I need to ensure my investment is protected.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1600000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
