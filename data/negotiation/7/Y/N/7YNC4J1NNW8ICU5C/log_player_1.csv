Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Considering Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I want to aim for a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for me.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always fall back to John. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Counteroffer:**  It's still worth trying to get a higher price. I'm not desperate for a sale, so I can afford to negotiate further. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and try to inch closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by reducing the price to $10,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping a profit margin.
* **Balancing Value and Profit:**  $10,500 is a price that is reasonably attractive to Bob (he values it at $8,000) while also exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to find a price that satisfies both parties.  By accepting Bob's offer, I would make less profit, and by rejecting it, I would risk him walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Bottom:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could counteroffer again, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with no sale at all.
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a good profit and eliminates the risk of a protracted negotiation.  

John is a reliable buyer, and accepting his offer ensures I achieve my minimum financial goal."
