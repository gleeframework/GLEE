# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $800,000, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and I'm unwilling to pay more than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best available price."
