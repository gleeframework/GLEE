"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $800,000.  Would that work for you?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $800,000, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
