"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
