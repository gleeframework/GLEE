"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this still reflects the significant value this product offers, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget.
