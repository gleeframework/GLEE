"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $10,200 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
