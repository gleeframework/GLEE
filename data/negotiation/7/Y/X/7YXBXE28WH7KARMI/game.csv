"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $80 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we settle on $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
