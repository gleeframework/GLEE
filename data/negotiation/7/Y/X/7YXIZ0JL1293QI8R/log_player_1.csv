Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $900,000 is a substantial profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest.  Holding out for more might push him away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could try for a higher price, further negotiation risks losing Bob altogether. John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed fallback, but accepting $900,000 secures a higher profit."
