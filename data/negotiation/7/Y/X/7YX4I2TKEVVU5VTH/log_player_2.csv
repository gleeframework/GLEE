"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,300,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not even worth negotiating further at this point, as it's clear there's a significant gap in their valuations. Bob should reject the offer and move to a counteroffer or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,900,000 reflects that more accurately. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
