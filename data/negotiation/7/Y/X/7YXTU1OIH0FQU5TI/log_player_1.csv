Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. This means any price above this is unlikely to be accepted.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position. You can aim for a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping he sees the value and is willing to pay a premium.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $825,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **Premium Pricing:** The $25,000 markup represents a relatively small percentage increase (around 3%), making it more palatable for Bob. 
* **Justification:** By vaguely mentioning ""significant benefits,"" you aim to subtly anchor the price increase to value rather than just a random markup.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If you believe Bob is risk-averse, a smaller markup might be more strategic to ensure a deal.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive offer could be beneficial. 

**Remember:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
