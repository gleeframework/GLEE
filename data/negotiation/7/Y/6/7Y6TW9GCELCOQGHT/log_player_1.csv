Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
