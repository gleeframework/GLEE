"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  $140 is too close to my maximum price, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Alice's offer. $135 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John."
