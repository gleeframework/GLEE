"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair offer for me. Let's try to work something out.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can find common ground here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
