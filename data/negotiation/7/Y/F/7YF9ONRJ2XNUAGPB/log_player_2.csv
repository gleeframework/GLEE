(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $20 drop from her initial offer is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. $105 is a fair midpoint between my last offer and her latest offer.  This should encourage her to accept, but still leaves me some room to negotiate if she counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'll counter one more time to see if we can reach an agreement.  If she rejects again, I'll consider buying from John as I'm running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm meeting Alice halfway with this offer, showing my willingness to close the deal. It's a fair compromise considering we've both moved closer to each other's positions. With only 4 rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick resolution.  If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John to avoid running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer a lower price, I only have three rounds left. I'm confident that I can't get a better deal within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within my budget, which is the most important factor now."
