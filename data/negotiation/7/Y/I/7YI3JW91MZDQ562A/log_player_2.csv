"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly or buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the price as low as possible.  A starting offer significantly lower than our target ($80) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she immediately rejects a low offer, we know we might have to move closer to her price range or consider John's offer.
* **Polite and Open:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down from her initial offer, $105 is still significantly higher than both our target price ($80) and our initial counteroffer ($60). It seems there's room for negotiation, so we'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $75?  That's a fair offer, considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We increased our offer from $60 to $75, demonstrating willingness to compromise but staying firmly below our $80 limit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market value"" subtly implies that we've researched the product's price, putting subtle pressure on Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and open, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $90? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $90 is still above our target price. We're only $10 apart, and we still have rounds to negotiate.  We'll try one more time to get closer to $80 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice! I'm willing to go up a bit to meet you in the middle. How about $85?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but with a Limit:** We're edging closer to Alice's price, showing flexibility but setting a firm boundary at $85.  
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** This creates a sense of urgency and signals that we're reaching our limit. While we can still negotiate, it puts the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to accept a price close to her desired range or risk losing the sale.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind, John's offer of $80 is still on the table if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
