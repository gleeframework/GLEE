"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $75?  That's a fair offer, considering the market value.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $90? This feels like a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,

"You're getting closer, Alice! I'm willing to go up a bit to meet you in the middle. How about $85?  That's my final offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
