"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your goal is to save money.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but you want to pay less. 
* **Alice's offer is too high.** $145 is closer to your max price than her minimum.  
* **You have a better option.** You can get the same product from John for $150, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the door to a potentially better deal."
