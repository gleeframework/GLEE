"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his desired range ($8,000 - $15,000) as possible.  He's offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still a fair amount considering the product's value to him. This should hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's desired range, it's still above his ideal price point. He has the opportunity to continue negotiating for a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $12,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's staying within a reasonable range. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's desired value, but below his maximum limit.  This should give Alice a good incentive to consider his counteroffer."
