"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has valuable features, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to pay no more than $800,000. By starting at $700,000, I leave space to negotiate upwards towards that limit if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility on price. Her response will give me valuable information for future rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,000,000. This is a generous offer considering its potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has come down $100,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room to Negotiate:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($1,000,000) and both my target price ($800,000) and my previous offer ($700,000).
* **John is the Backup:** I have the option to buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and demonstrates I'm serious about making this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice came down $100,000, so I'm offering to go up $150,000,  landing slightly closer to my target than her current offer.
* **Urgency and Seriousness:** My message conveys a desire to close the deal and emphasizes the significant movement I'm making. 
* **Safety Net:** I'm still comfortably below my absolute maximum price (John's offer), leaving room for final adjustments if needed."
