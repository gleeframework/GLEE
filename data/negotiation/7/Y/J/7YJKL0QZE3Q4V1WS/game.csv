"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could greatly enhance your daily routine. I understand that its value might be subjective, but based on my experience and feedback from other satisfied customers, it's truly worth more than just $80. However, I'm willing to start our negotiation at $120. This price reflects not only the quality of the product but also the opportunity to experience something that could potentially make a significant difference in your life. What do you think about this starting point?",120.0,Alice,1,
