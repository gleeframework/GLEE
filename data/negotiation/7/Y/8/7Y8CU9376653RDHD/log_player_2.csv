"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get it for less.  Rejecting allows me to try for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. Let's try to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's worth accepting rather than risking another counteroffer that could be even higher.  I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
