"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to drop below $1,600,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,560,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1560000.0,Alice,5,
