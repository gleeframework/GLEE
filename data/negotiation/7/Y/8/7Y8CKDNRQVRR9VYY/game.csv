"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that we're nearing the middle ground. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that we're getting close to a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
