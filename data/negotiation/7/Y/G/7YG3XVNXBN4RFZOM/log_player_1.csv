This offer is above Bob's value but below your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
