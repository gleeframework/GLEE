"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to move closer to his value if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I am not willing to accept that price, so I will reject it. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps me above my minimum price of $150, giving me some room to potentially meet Bob's needs while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's within the range I'm willing to negotiate. While I could try to get a bit more, there's a chance I could lose the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a reasonable profit."
