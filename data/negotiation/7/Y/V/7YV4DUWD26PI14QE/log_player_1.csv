{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful to get closer to my asking price of $14,000.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'd prefer to stay closer to my initial asking price of $14,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This is my best offer based on my budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $12,500. This is only $500 less than my ideal price of $13,000.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
