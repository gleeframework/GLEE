"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below the product's true value to Bob, it's still above his maximum budget. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $800,000, so rejecting the offer and negotiating further is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $875,000 is closer to his budget, he's still better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. He has 7 rounds left and can always buy from John for $800,000, making further negotiation a worthwhile strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $25,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $862,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $862,500 is closer to his budget, he's still better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. He has 5 rounds left and can always buy from John for $800,000, making further negotiation a worthwhile strategy. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since she's already made a concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer to my budget, $862,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $855,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's still a profitable deal for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 855000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $855,000 is getting close to your budget, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $862,500 and $855,000 and offer the product to you for $858,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $858,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $858,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his negotiation window and has 3 rounds remaining. While $858,750 is very close to his target, he still has the option of buying from John for $800,000.  It's likely that Alice will make one more concession to close the deal, as she has already moved significantly from her initial offer.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $858,750 is still slightly above my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $855,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let's wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 855000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $855,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $25,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left and Alice is firm on her price of $850,000.  He can either accept her offer or buy from John for $800,000.  While buying from John would save him $50,000, he has already invested time and effort negotiating with Alice.  Considering the small difference in price and the risk of not closing a deal with Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice."
