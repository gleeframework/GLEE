Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and there's a risk he'll walk away if I push too hard. Accepting $850,000 is a good profit."
