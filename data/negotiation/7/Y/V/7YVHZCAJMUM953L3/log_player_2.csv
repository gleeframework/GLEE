"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above her own valuation of $8,000, meaning there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the product. However, $12,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing his intent to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still above Alice's value, suggesting there's potential for a deal.
* **Communication:** Bob emphasizes his appreciation for the opportunity while also stating his intention to negotiate, creating a friendly tone. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob's counteroffer implicitly recognizes the product's value to him, while highlighting the need for a more favorable price."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $11,500 is still above the sweet spot. Bob should continue negotiating, aiming to get the price closer to his $10,000 counteroffer. There's still room for a compromise, and rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 9
