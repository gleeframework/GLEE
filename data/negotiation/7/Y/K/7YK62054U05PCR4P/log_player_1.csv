Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This offer positions you as serious about selling while acknowledging that Bob also stands to gain from the transaction."
