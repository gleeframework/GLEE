"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",12200.0,Alice,5,
