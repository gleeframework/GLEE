Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.

This is a good deal!  We're saving $800 from John's price, and Alice seems firm on her bottom line. Let's take it."
