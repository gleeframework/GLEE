"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm still pretty interested but $11,500 is a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
