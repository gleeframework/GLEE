Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is clearly very interested and has moved substantially from his initial offer. Accepting $1,500,000 secures a significant profit above your minimum."
