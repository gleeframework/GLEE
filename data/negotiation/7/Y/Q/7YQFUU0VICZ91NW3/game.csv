"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I recognize your valuation, the product's true worth is closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
