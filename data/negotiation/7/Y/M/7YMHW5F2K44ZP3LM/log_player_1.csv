Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a potential gain and encourages him to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go up or down depending on Bob's response.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is still a decent profit, it's worth trying to push for a higher price.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely that Bob is firm on his offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away and you being left with only John's offer is too high.  $12,500 is a good profit, and it's important to secure the sale."
