"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and allows me to see how willing Bob is to pay. It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed buyer for $15,000, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. It's important to remember that selling to John is a safe option, but I'd prefer to maximize my earnings if possible.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value of $15,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable selling point. Since Bob made a counteroffer, it indicates he's interested, and I want to keep the negotiation moving towards a successful close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm losing rounds,  John is still a safe option, and I am confident I can negotiate a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm dropping my price further to $15,500, which is still above my minimum value.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's necessary to keep the negotiation going.  Bob seems to be more willing to negotiate down than up, so I'm trying to meet him halfway while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum value of $15,000. I've been negotiating for a while, and while I'm not happy with the price, John is a safe option, and selling to him will secure me a decent profit. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and ending up with a lower price.  It's time to take the sure thing."
