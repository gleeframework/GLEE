"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at a slightly discounted price. I believe this offer presents great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $15,000, there's room for a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $14,250? This still represents a reasonable discount for you while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

``` 
Alice's offer of $14,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the $15,000 Bob is willing to pay, and it's a compromise from Alice's previous offer.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John."
