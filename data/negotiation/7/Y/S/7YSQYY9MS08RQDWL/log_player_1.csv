{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but not drastically so. This allows for negotiation and gives me room to potentially make a profit.  Remember, I have John as a backup offer, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the current market and the condition of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to earn more, securing a sale at $12,000 is a good outcome, especially considering I have a guaranteed sale at the same price with John."
