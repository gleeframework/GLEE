"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,175,000 is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
