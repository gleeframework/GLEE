"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we may be stuck.  I'm willing to go down to $8,750, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'm going to have to move on to other options.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,
