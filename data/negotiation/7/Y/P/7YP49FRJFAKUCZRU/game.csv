"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $78 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $81? It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to what we want.",81.0,Alice,5,
