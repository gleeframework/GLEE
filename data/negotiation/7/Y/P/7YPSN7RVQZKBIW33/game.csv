"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a very competitive offer considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can settle on a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm thinking of a price of $1,080,000. This is a compromise that's slightly above the middle ground, but I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain! How about we split the difference and settle at $1,065,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1065000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,065,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm ready to close this deal today.  What if we make it a clean $1,070,000? That's my final offer.",1070000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to close the deal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,070,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
