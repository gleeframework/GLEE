"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows us both to get a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750. This is a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
