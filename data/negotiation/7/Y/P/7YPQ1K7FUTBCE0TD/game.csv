"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
