# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John."
