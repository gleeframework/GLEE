Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential worth to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm stating I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and preventing Bob from immediately rejecting the deal.  I'm also ready to pivot to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest. This means there's still room for negotiation and potentially reaching a more favorable price.
* **Exploring a Counteroffer:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground that is more profitable for me. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and moving to a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation alive and have the potential to achieve a better outcome than accepting his low price or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not shutting down the negotiation. This shows I'm open to compromise.
* **Balancing Compromise with Profit:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating flexibility. This is still well above Bob's offer but acknowledges his financial limitations.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent worth, hoping to shift the perceived value back toward my favor.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm explicitly calling for a compromise, indicating willingness to meet halfway.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward, maintain leverage, and potentially secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** Bob has declared his offer to be final, implying he's unwilling to go higher. 
* **John's Offer is More Attractive:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a significantly higher return than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Risk of Further Delays:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and might not result in a better offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am choosing to secure the guaranteed profit from John's offer. The risk of not reaching a better agreement with Bob is too high compared to the guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go one final step and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob towards accepting.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm essentially meeting Bob halfway again, increasing my offer to $1,150,000, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to influence his decision in my favor.
* **Threat of Moving On:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer, putting pressure on him to accept.

This approach aims to maximize the potential for a deal with Bob while still maintaining a reasonable price point for me. If Bob still rejects, I'm ready to move on to John."
