"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",17500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. I do value the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we do $12,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal today, but I can't go higher than $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
