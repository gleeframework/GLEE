Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified, even though you haven't explicitly revealed its worth to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying you have other buyers like John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, he may not be willing to pay that much.  His willingness to pay might be influenced by factors we don't know.
* **Negotiation:** This offer opens the door for negotiation. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy in mind for how you'll respond."
