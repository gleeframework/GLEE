"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I like it, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $115. That's my best price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm still very interested in the product, but $115 is just a bit outside what I can do.  Would you consider $100? That's the top of my budget, and I think it's a fair offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $110. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,7,
