"I appreciate the unique product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $2,025,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but $2,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. This is the highest I can go.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth.",1975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1925000.0,Bob,6,
