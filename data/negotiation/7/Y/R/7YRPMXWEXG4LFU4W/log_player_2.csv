"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than both her valuation and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $9,250 is still above my ideal purchase point. I'll try to negotiate a little further down."
