,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $1,200,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This price is still below what I could get from another buyer, but I want to work with you if possible.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I was thinking I could get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I'm close to my budget, and I think this is a fair price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $980,000 is very close to my minimum, but I can't go any lower.  I'm willing to stick with my last offer of $1,000,000.  If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
