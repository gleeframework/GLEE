"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Accepting Alice's offer saves money:** $110 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $120 and cheaper than John's offer of $120."
