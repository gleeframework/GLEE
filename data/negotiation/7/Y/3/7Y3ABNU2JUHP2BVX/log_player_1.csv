"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation without immediately hitting a dead end. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for both of us, emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid with the price, leaving space for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually acceptable point. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm aware that I have a backup buyer, which gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also much lower than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates interest and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Leveraging John:** I have a backup buyer, which gives me strong leverage to push for a better deal. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range.  This will keep the negotiation moving while maintaining my bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $950,000 is below what I can accept at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work. This price still gives you a great deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain leverage:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not so much that it compromises my minimum acceptable amount.  
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting the value for Bob, reminding him that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Suggesting a middle ground:** This encourages Bob to come up a bit from his initial offer, paving the way for a potential agreement.
* **Keeping John in the back of my mind:** This offer keeps me well above John's offer, but it also allows room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $980,000 is still below my desired range.  
* **Time is still on my side:** We are only four rounds in, and I have John as a fallback option. 
* **Building pressure:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal, increasing the pressure on him to come up or risk losing the deal.  

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away the value of the product just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $980,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,015,000.  This price is a good compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to meet halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not sacrificing too much of my desired price.
* **Emphasize mutual satisfaction:** I'm framing this as a win-win scenario, emphasizing that both parties will be content with the deal.
* **Urgency without pressure:** I'm subtly suggesting that we close the deal, creating a sense of urgency without being aggressive.
* **Staying above John's offer:**  This counteroffer still keeps me above John's price, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is inching closer, $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is running out, but John is an option:**  We're nearing the halfway point, and while I have a strong fallback option with John, I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at this point. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer again, but this time with a counteroffer that will be more decisive. If he doesn't come closer to my price, I'm prepared to switch to John.

I'm going to counter with a price close to my desired amount, leaving minimal room for further negotiation. This will force Bob to decide if he wants to close the deal or walk away."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm ready to make a final offer.  Given the value of this product, I'm prepared to accept $1,030,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find this deal very worthwhile. If you're not interested at this price, I'll be moving on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 1030000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm stating that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and commitment.
* **Close to my target:**  I'm  making a counteroffer that is closer to my ideal, leaving very little room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of the deal's potential benefits.
* **Threat of moving on:** I'm subtly mentioning other opportunities to create pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Prepared to switch:**  This counteroffer still keeps me above John's price, but I'm ready to accept his offer if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $995000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are on the eighth round, and we're close to the final few rounds.
* **Bob's offer is not satisfactory:** While Bob is offering a higher price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John is a secure option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  With only three rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating with Bob, especially considering his final offer is still below my minimum.

To ensure I secure a deal and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob, I'm going to sell to John. This guarantees me my minimum desired price and provides a safe and secure outcome."
