"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's worth $9500 for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and its significance to you, I'm willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $9200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is a good price, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. He can likely get it for lower than this by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting allows him to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm prepared to pay $9,100 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $9150 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already successfully negotiated the price down from $9,500 to $9,150.  He's only $150 away from his target price of $9,000. While there's a chance he could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely Alice won't go lower, and he risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
