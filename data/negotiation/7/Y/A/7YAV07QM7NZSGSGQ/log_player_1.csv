Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 positions it significantly below its value to Alice ($1,200,000+) while still leaving room for a sizable profit.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the fact that the offer is time-limited, we increase the perceived value and encourage a quick decision from Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,100,000, there might be a small window for negotiation if Bob counters, but Alice should stay firm above $1,200,000."
