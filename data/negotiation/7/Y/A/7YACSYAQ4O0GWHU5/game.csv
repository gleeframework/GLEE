"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750000, which I believe is a fair starting point given my budget.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. I believe this price is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $780000 for the product.  This reflects a significant discount from your initial offer, and it's the highest I can go at this time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $810000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this point.",810000.0,Alice,5,
