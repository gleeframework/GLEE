"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid I can't accept $9000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $9500. Can we meet at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
