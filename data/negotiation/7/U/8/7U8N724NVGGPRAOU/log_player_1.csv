Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 exceeds my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
