Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and is a significant improvement over John's offer. It's also closer to Bob's desired price point than John's.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or not getting a better price outweighs the potential for saving a few more dollars.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
