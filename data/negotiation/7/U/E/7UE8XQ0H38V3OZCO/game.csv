"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $14,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price that allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. My revised offer is $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your increased offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
