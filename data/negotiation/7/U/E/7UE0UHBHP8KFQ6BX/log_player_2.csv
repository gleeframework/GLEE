"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, it's worth up to $15,000 to you (Bob).  Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum price and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
