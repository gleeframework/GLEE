Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for slightly less and still make a profit, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves Bob with a potential $1,000 gain, making it a very attractive proposition for him and increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving Alice the best chance to get the highest possible price from Bob."
