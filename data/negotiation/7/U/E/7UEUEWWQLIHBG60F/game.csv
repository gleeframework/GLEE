"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I'm confident it would meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,500. This is a very fair price considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer lined up for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested in taking advantage of this opportunity.",10500.0,Alice,1,
