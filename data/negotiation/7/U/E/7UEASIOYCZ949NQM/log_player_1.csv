Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's value of $1,200,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while also pushing him closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.  It should encourage Bob to accept, as he has already indicated he's willing to pay over $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum price, so I'll choose to sell to John."
