"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $16,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $17,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17,000. I'm willing to compromise at $18,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I see we're both trying to find a solution that works for us. I'm still confident we can make a deal. How about $17,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",17500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17,500. I'm willing to compromise at $19,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, though. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,7,
