Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not sure if he's willing to go any higher.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me a good return. I'm going to sell the product to John."
