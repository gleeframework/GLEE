Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob.  Here's why:

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so any price above that is potentially acceptable.
* **Value to me:** My minimum acceptable price is $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate slightly lower to secure a sale with Bob.
* **John's offer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage. I can afford to offer a lower price to Bob and still make a decent profit if he accepts.

This offer presents a good balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
