"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $800000? That's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
