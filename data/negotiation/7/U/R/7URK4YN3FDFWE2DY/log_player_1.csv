Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your minimum acceptable price is that amount. However, aiming for a higher price with Bob is the best strategy to maximize potential profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  A price too close to $1,500,000 might discourage Bob. Offering a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to find acceptable is key. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price helps frame the offer in a positive light.  

By starting at $1,350,000, you:

1. Give yourself room to negotiate down if needed.
2. Potentially secure a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
