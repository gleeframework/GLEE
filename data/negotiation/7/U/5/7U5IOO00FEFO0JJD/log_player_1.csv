Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still making a profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
