Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also allows me to make a profit.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made two counteroffers.  It's likely that the negotiations will continue to go back and forth.  At this point, it's best to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
