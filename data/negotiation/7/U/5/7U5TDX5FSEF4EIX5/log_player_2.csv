"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have the option of buying from John for $15,000, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $15,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
