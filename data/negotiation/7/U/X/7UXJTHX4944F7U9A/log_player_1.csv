Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice above her minimum selling price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has the security of John as a backup buyer, so she can afford to be a bit more firm in her initial offer to Bob."
