"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80 to you. To start, I propose a price of $120 for the product.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for our product, we must respectfully decline. We believe that our product is worth more than $90. I would like to counter with an offer of $105. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while providing you with a high-quality product. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",105.0,Alice,3,,
