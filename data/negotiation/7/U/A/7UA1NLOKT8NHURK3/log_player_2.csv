"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer of $110 is within your range, but you want to save money. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $100, offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $110, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's a good compromise that shows you're serious about buying but also want a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high, even though it's a slight decrease from her initial price. You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, but there's no need to rush into an agreement when you have more rounds to negotiate and you have a backup option with John. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice by rejecting her current offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to accept your initial offer of $105.  This time, you're increasing your offer slightly to $108. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still remaining below your maximum price of $120. It's possible Alice will accept this counteroffer, as it's closer to her desired price and shows you're serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is a good price considering you are willing to pay $120.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, and then potentially increasing her offer. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk losing it to another seller or to John's higher price."
