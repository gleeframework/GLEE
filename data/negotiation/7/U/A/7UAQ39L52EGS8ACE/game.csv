"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great discount from the original price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great deal for you as well.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was thinking of.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  Let's try $9,750. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,500, which would be $10,125. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",10125.0,Alice,7,
