Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,800,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds tremendous potential for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum acceptable value.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,400,000, which still reflects the product's true value. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I understand this product has value, but I'm firm on my initial offer of $800000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. Let's avoid further back-and-forth and find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is not budging from his initial offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds, or else I'll need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $800000.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's make a decision quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is adamant about his low offer and shows no signs of budging.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go lower.  To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value."
