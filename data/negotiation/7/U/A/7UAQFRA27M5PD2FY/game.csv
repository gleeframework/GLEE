"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1400000, which still reflects the product's true value. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I understand this product has value, but I'm firm on my initial offer of $800000.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. Let's avoid further back-and-forth and find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
