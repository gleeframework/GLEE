"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a really valuable item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $175 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $125, which is a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we meet at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
