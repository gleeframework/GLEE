"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
