"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $750000. This is a significant concession, considering the product's value to me is still $1000000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $750000. I'm thinking more in the range of $675000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $715000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a final concession. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $715000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $715000, so I'll offer $707500. Can you meet me there?",707500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $700000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $700000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",700000.0,Bob,10,
