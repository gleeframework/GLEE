"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850000? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",850000.0,Bob,4,
