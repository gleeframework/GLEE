"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  Let's make it $10,750 and call it a deal?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really close now. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,875?  That's a fair offer.",10875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,875. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
