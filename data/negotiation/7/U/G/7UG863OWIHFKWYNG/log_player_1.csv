Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer without trying to negotiate a lower price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  There's an element of risk involved, as a higher offer might lead Bob to reject it outright. However, given the potential profit, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
