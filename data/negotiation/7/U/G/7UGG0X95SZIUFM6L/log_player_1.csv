This offer starts at a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn a good amount.  It also shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  While $15,000 is my ideal, I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get closer to that."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hopeful I can get him to agree to a price closer to $9,000."
