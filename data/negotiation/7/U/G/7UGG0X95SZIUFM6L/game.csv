"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to cover my costs.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
