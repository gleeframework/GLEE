You can do better than $95.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."

I'm going to start by offering $90. This is still a fair price for Alice, and it gives me some wiggle room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $92, which is a good price considering my goal is to pay less than $100.  It's not a huge saving, but it's better than buying from John."
