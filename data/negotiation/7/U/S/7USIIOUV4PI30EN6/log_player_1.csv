Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing it's likely more than Bob is willing to pay. This sets a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard price, but rather asking Bob for his opinion. This allows for a more flexible negotiation.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup buyer at $80."
