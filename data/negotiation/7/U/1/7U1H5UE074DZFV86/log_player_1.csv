Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to my alternative offer.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I add a sense of urgency and value, potentially persuading Bob to act quickly."
