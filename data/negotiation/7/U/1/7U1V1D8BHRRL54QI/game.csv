"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
