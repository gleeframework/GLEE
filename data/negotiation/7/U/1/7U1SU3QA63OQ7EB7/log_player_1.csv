""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it slightly below Alice's minimum ($15,000) creates a potential win-win.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice aims to secure a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
