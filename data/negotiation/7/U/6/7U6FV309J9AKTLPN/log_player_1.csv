Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but not too far from Bob's estimated value.  It allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him."

Bob's offer of $8,000 matches my minimum value and is the same price as what John is offering. I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
