"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique features and potential,"" I'm aiming to create a narrative of value that might push Bob to reconsider his initial valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's perspective, signaling I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential savings for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is already above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to stretch.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I'm confident in the value this product holds, and I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the unique advantages it offers and should provide a substantial return for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial price to show Bob I'm flexible and serious about reaching a deal.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** It's crucial to stay above $1,200,000 (John's offer) to ensure I'm maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's benefits and potential ""return,"" I'm reinforcing its value in Bob's mind and justifying the higher price. 
* **Inviting a Response:** The counteroffer encourages further negotiation, keeping the door open for Bob to respond with a revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still above my maximum budget. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,200,000.  This price allows for a fair return for both of us and avoids further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches the guaranteed price John is offering. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of success. Accepting now provides immediate profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. 
* **Strong Negotiation:** We've engaged in a robust negotiation process, and Bob has steadily increased his offer. This indicates he's serious about the purchase, and accepting at this point is a reasonable outcome."
