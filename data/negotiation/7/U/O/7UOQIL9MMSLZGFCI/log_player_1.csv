Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets the anchor for negotiation. While Bob might try to negotiate down, it gives you room to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and avoids unnecessary complexity."
