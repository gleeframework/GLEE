Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts â€“ I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the higher price as a reflection of that value, not just an arbitrary number.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating down a bit. This leaves you with the potential to earn even more than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob's financial situation and negotiation style, you might choose a different approach."
