Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, but closer to his perceived value. I hope this encourages him to accept, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is only slightly below my minimum value and represents a good compromise. Since further negotiation might lead to a longer process and a risk of losing the deal completely, I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
