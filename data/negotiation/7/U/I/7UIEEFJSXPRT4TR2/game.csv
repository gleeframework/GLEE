"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and potential for your business, while also allowing me to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,275,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to close this deal.  This price reflects the value we've discussed and allows me to move forward with this sale.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm eager to see you succeed with it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
