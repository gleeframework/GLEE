"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $1,000,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a special opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a price that reflects its worth while allowing you to make a significant saving. I trust you will find this offer compelling and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You value the product at $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you're still paying more than what it's worth to you.
* **John's offer is your fallback option.**  While it's not ideal, it's still better than paying more than the product's value to you. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate further with her or go with John's offer to save some money."
