"Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline. My company has invested considerable resources into developing this product, and it is valued at $1200000 to me. However, I am willing to consider a compromise. I propose a final offer of $1275000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the product's worth to both of us and ensures a fair return for my investment. I hope this proposal meets your expectations, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Dear Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget of $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is the best price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it. If not, I'll need to consider buying the product from John for the same price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
