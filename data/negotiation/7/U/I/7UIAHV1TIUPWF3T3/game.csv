"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to your company. I'm confident that it could generate substantial returns for you.  I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and it allows for a substantial profit margin for you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up at a lower price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
