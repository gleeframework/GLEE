"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better. He has a maximum budget of $15,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, and Bob's message is polite and open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  At this price, Bob saves $4,000 compared to buying from John and gets a product worth $10,000 to Alice. This is a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that further negotiation would only result in a small decrease in price."
