```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him a good deal while still securing a decent profit for myself.

```

**Explanation:**

* I'll counteroffer to get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $13,250? This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price below its actual value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm proposing a price in the middle of our last offers, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while staying above my minimum threshold. If Bob rejects, I'm ready to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and it's closer to your asking price.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* While I could continue negotiating, I'm aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my desired price.
* Time is money, and I don't want to risk further negotiations potentially falling through. 
* Selling to John guarantees me the highest profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
