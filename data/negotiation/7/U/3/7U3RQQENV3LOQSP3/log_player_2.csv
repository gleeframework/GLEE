Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $800,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground.
