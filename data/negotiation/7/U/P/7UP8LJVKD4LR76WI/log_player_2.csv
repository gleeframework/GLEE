"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still more than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $13,800, which is getting closer to Bob's limit.  However, Bob has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them. This suggests that Alice is unlikely to go lower.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $15,000.  It's a higher price, but it guarantees a deal and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
