"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's best to counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate down to a more reasonable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than my actual maximum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to influence Alice's perception of what's a reasonable price. 
* **Alternative:** I always have the option to buy from John at $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still above both my initial offer and my maximum price. I want to see if I can push her closer to $10,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $9,500, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer, but only by a small amount ($1,500). 
* **Near Maximum:** This offer is very close to my absolute maximum, signaling to Alice that I'm serious but have limited flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm not mentioning John explicitly, but the fact that I have an alternative adds subtle pressure for Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** While still above my ideal price, $11,000 is within my acceptable range and represents a $4,000 saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
