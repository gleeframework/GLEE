**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the value to you. While it's worth a maximum of $1,200,000 to you, her language suggests she knows it's less than that.
* Her offer of $1,150,000 leaves little room for negotiation and still puts you significantly above your alternative.
* Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer. She's motivated to sell and might come down closer to her $1,000,000 valuation.

**It's a negotiation tactic:** By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and won't overpay. This puts you in a stronger position to get a better deal, either from Alice or by going with John's offer."
