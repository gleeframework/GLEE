{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to make the offer appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is also below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), leaving space for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
* **Strong Opening:**  A firm but fair opening price demonstrates confidence and sets a starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation process moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for a better outcome:** I can likely negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a much better price.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While I can't go as low as $9,500, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer ($9,500) and my previous offer ($11,500).  This shows a willingness to compromise and could make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), so I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and clearly states my counteroffer, without being overly aggressive.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  The message expresses appreciation for Bob's interest and acknowledges his budget constraints, aiming to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of losing the sale and having to sell to John at $12,000 is significant.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further price reductions, potentially below my minimum.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale with a reasonable profit.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this scenario. It minimizes risk, secures a sale, and yields a decent profit, considering the potential downsides of continued negotiation or selling to John."
