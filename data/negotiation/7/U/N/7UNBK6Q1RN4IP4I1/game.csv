"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
