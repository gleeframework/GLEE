"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
