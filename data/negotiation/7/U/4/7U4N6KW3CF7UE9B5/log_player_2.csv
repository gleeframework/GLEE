Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is a bit tight, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $100 for the product, considering its value to me is $120. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit far from your $70, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to give it a shot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while $90 isn't a terrible price, you know you can get it for your target price from John. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and go for the guaranteed deal."
