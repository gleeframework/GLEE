"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start significantly above Bob's perceived value but below our minimum to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential"" attempts to frame the product as highly desirable without revealing specifics.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob's feedback, signaling our willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor:** Establish a high starting point that influences subsequent offers.
* **Gauge:**  Assess Bob's initial reaction and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Avoid showing desperation by keeping the John offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, reflecting the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. We have room to maneuver and should try to bring him closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product. While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,350,000. This price still reflects a significant discount while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers. Would you be open to discussing this further?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We lowered our price by $50,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing specifics.
* **Target Range:**  We're aiming for a price within the $1,350,000 - $1,400,000 range, allowing room for further negotiation while staying above our minimum.
* **Open Communication:**  We encourage further discussion, keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still limited by my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and demonstrates his willingness to meet us closer to our desired range. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might not go higher. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher offer from Bob means we risk losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While the potential upside exists, the difference is now small enough to justify accepting Bob's offer."
