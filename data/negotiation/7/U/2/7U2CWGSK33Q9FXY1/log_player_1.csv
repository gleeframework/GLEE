Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get more. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price and see if I can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,250. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $9,250 is still a good price for me and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for only $8,000."
