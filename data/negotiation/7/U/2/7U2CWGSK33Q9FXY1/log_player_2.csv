Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
