"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $950,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $887,500. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $887,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $862,500,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $862,500 is sufficient. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $882,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,7,
