Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000.
* This price is less than what I would get from John ($15,000), but still higher than the value of the product to Bob ($10,000). 
* This creates an opportunity for Bob to make a profit, incentivizing him to accept the offer. 
* If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and guarantee a profit of $15,000."
