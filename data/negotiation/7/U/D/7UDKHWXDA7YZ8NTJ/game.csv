"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $9,000 in mind.  Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $14,000?  I'm motivated to find a fair agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
