"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $950,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,
