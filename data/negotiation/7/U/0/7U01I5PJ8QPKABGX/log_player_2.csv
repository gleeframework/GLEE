"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $800,000 is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob wants to explore all possibilities for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $950,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
