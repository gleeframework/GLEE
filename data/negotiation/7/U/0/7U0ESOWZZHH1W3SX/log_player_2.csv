"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is really the lowest I can go. This product is in high demand and I know it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $17,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm still firm on $15,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about this - I can do $16,250, and that's my final offer.  I need to be fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price. While $16,250 is a better price than before, it's still above his target. He has several rounds left, and he's still hopeful to secure the product for $15,000.  He'll counteroffer again."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,250 is still stretching my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
