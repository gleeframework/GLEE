"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is really the lowest I can go. This product is in high demand and I know it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm still firm on $15,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about this - I can do $16,250, and that's my final offer.  I need to be fair to both of us.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,250 is still stretching my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",15500.0,Bob,6,
