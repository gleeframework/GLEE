"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm ""open to negotiation"" shows good faith and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language (""amazing product,"" ""love"") to make the product seem appealing and increase the likelihood of Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially getting a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a really high-quality product, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm reducing my price by $1,000 from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Value Justification:**  I emphasize the product's quality to justify my slightly higher price. This reinforces the value I place on the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the door open for further negotiation and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is high-quality, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and see if I can reach a price closer to $9,000.  It's worth the risk of potentially losing the deal with Bob if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500.  I'm still feeling a little tight on that number, but I'm willing to go down to $8,750.  It's a fair compromise, and we can get this deal done.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""fair compromise"" and ""get this deal done"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a positive response.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I emphasize ""we can get this deal done"" to highlight the potential for a successful outcome.
* **Call to Action:**  The question ""Let me know what you think!"" encourages Bob to respond and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $8750 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8200. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired $8,500 by continuing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $8,000 if I don't get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8200.  I'm still holding out for a bit more to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $8400? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's, showing a commitment to compromise and reaching an agreement.
* **Fair Price:**  I emphasize that $8400 is a ""fair price for both of us"" to make it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Urgency:**  I reiterate the ""close this deal"" point to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you say?"" leaves the ball in Bob's court and prompts a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $8400. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but we've been going back and forth for several rounds.  There's a chance that Bob might continue to lowball me in the next round.  Also, given that we're already at round 8, I have limited time remaining to reach an agreement.  

To avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation or ending up with a lower price than John is offering, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. This ensures a guaranteed sale and a reasonable return on my product."
