Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1750000?  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but are firm on your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  Let's compromise at $1600000. This offer is a reasonable middle ground and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.  I'm confident this is a good opportunity for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're committed to reaching an agreement, but are still sticking to your budget.  You've increased your offer again, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
