"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's very favorable. Let me know if you're interested, I'm confident you won't regret it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob's maximum price is $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
