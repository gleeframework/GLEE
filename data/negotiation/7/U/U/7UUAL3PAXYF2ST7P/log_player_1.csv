"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer of $1,150,000. This anchors the negotiation closer to our desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While our minimum is $1,200,000 (John's offer), starting slightly lower allows room for concessions and counteroffers.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our target price and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. We will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This reflects my commitment to seeing this product in the hands of someone who truly understands its worth."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a moderate concession from $1,150,000 to $1,120,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate, but also signals that we're firm on the product's value. 
* **Reframing Value:** The message reiterates the product's worth and positions the lower price as a gesture of goodwill and a commitment to finding a deal. 
* **Maintaining Strong Position:** We're still significantly above Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation moving towards our desired price range while leaving room for further concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of the product, and I respect that. However, $1,120,000 is still out of my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the highest I can realistically offer.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, indicating his interest, but we still have negotiating room and a solid alternative with John. Here's why we're rejecting and proceeding to the next round:

* **Positive Trajectory:**  Bob's offers are slowly moving towards our desired range. This suggests continued negotiation might yield a better outcome than $1,075,000.
* **John's Offer:** We have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making Bob's current offer significantly less attractive.
* **Time Consideration:** While we are nearing the halfway point in the negotiation, we still have time to try and close the gap with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the product's unique nature."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a price that's a direct compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offer and Bob's latest. This can be a strong tactic to encourage agreement.
* **Highlighting Concession:** We emphasize that this is a significant price reduction from our side, reinforcing the idea that we're trying to find a deal. 
* **Final Push:** While we're open to further negotiation, this offer is close enough to our desired range. It puts the ball in Bob's court and encourages him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer! While I value this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,085,000. It's a significant investment on my end, and I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to switch gears. Here's why:

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob is negotiating, his increases are incremental. At this pace, we're unlikely to bridge the gap to a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a risk. We have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which Bob is consistently below. 
* **Strong Alternative:** John's offer eliminates risk and secures our minimum desired price. There's no compelling reason to continue the negotiation with Bob when we have a better option secured."
