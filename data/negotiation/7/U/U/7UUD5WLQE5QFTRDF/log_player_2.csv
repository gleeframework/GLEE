# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, I'm not in a rush to accept. I'll try to get a better price from Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high. I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more. It's worth seeing if I can get her to budge further before committing."

I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's the best we can do. I'm willing to accept this price and finalize the deal with you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,025,000.  It's a good deal for me, saving me $170,000 compared to buying from John.  At this point, I'm confident that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price.  It's time to finalize the deal."
