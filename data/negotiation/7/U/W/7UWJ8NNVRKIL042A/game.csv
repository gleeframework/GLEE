"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $1400000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1550000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal on a valuable product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1400000. How about we try to find a price closer to that mark? Can you consider $1450000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's try $1500000. It's fair to both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
