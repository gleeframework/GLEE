"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $887,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money.",887500.0,Alice,5,
