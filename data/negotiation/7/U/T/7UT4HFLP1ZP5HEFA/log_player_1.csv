"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still below my minimum ($150). 
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation (in this case, a $10 buffer) allows for a possible compromise.
* **Option to Sell to John:** If Bob rejects, I can always go to John, ensuring I at least get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. There's still a chance I can get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  With 10 rounds, I have time to explore options and see if Bob will budge.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to meet in the middle, perhaps at $140 or slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130).
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I remind Bob that the product is worth the price and that he'll be satisfied with the purchase.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  While $135 is closer to my minimum, I'm still leaving a small margin for potential adjustments if Bob is adamant about a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $128? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $128 is still below my minimum price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** While Bob is clearly trying to get a better price, he's still interested. There's room for more negotiation.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore if there's a price we can agree on. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to move the price up a bit, perhaps to $132, but I'll be mindful of not pushing Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $132.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it's a price I can realistically work with.  I'm confident you won't regret this purchase - the product is truly fantastic!"", ""product_price"": 132} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while still inching closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I remind Bob of the product's value and express confidence in his satisfaction.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. However, I'm not willing to settle too low yet.

**Next Steps:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to make a final counteroffer to try and secure a deal or accept the risk of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $129, but that's as high as I can stretch. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $129 is still below my minimum price of $150. 
* **Time is Limited:** I have only 4 rounds left, so the pressure is mounting to close a deal.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer slightly shows he's still interested. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum but still appealing to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you at $131.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 131} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final counteroffer, leaving only three rounds remaining.
* **Compromise:** I'm only increasing the price by $2, showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining and encouraging a swift decision.
* **Finality:**  The message implies that this is my final offer. 

**Next Steps:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to giving up, but I really want to get this product. Can you meet me at $128? That's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, I don't have time for further negotiation. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $128 is still below my minimum price of $150, and I'm not willing to settle for that.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum price and a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, I need to prioritize ensuring I get my desired profit.  Therefore, I will sell to John."
