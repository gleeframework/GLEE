"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. Selling to John would only net me $1,000,000, so I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the value I know this product will bring you.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel that I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's true value.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are no longer exceeding my minimum price of $1,000,000. While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation.  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing with Bob."
