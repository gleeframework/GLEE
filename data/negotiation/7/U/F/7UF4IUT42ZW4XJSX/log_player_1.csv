"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me and I can still negotiate with Bob. I'll try to get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me a good profit, and hopefully, it's a better fit for your budget. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,150,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still determined to get closer to my initial asking price. I can still negotiate with Bob and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  It's also the most I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is equal to what John is offering. At this point, I don't see any room for further negotiation with Bob and risk losing a sure deal with John.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $1,200,000."
