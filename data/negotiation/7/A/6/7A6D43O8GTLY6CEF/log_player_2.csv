Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $1,300,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand your perspective on its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would represent a significant step from my initial ask and brings us closer to a deal.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
