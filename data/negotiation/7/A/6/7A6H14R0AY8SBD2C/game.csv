"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $9000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which would be $10000. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.
