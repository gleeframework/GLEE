"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, you might as well buy it from John, who you know will sell it to you for that price. There's no need to negotiate with Alice."
