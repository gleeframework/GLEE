,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90?  It's a fair price for a great product.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90. How about $87.50? Can you consider that?,87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $89.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
