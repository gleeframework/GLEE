"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  I can offer $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price of $10,000 within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal. It's time to take the safe and profitable route."
