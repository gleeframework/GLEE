"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  I can offer $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle on this.",9500.0,Bob,4,
