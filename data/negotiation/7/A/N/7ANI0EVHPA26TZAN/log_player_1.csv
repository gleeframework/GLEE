I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, but I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $875,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."

While Bob's offer is slightly lower than what I initially hoped for, it's still above John's offer, and I'm confident that I can make a profit on this sale.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
