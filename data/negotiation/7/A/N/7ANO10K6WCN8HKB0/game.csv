"Alice, thanks for the offer. $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $850000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $825000. This is a fair price that's within my range and closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
