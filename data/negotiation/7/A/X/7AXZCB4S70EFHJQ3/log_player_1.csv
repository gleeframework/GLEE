Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
