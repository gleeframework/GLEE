"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product worth $10,000 at a competitive rate. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than John's price of $10,000. While Alice claims the product is worth $10,000, it doesn't align with your budget or John's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $500."
