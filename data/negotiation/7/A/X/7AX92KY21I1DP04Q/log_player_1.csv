Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. I'm eager to move forward with this deal, but  need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer. However, while I understand the value you're placing on the product, $975,000 is still outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a substantial amount for me, and I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While it's less than I hoped for, accepting Bob's offer of $950,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a substantial profit over John's offer. 
* **Negotiating Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results, and could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments or opportunities."
