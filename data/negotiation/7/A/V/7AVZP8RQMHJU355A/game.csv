"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to offer you $1000000 for it. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1175000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not ready to accept $1175000. I'm thinking of a price of $1275000. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1275000 is still above my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer you $1200000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
