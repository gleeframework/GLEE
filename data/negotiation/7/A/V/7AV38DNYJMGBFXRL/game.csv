"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 is more reflective of its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. This price allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
