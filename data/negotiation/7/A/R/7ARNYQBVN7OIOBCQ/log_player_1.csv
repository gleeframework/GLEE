Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for a counteroffer:**  I want Bob to feel like he can get a better deal, encouraging him to counteroffer.
* **Keeping the John option in mind:**  If Bob doesn't counter or his counteroffer is too low, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $9,500.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is still interested, so there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option open to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $6,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the deal while still getting a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob has already rejected two offers, and his counteroffers are getting closer to his initial offer, suggesting he's not willing to pay much more.
* **John's offer is the best option:** I'm guaranteed $10,000 by selling to John, which is well above my minimum price and significantly more than Bob's current offer.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most sensible choice, maximizing my earnings and ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with."
