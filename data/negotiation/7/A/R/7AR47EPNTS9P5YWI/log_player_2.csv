"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me though.  How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Start low:**  It leaves room for negotiation and signals that $95 is unacceptable.
* **Be polite:** Maintaining a good rapport can lead to a better deal. 
* **Be direct:**  We clearly state our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down. Alice is showing a willingness to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $80 seems fair to me, how about it?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be firm but fair:** We're now at Alice's perceived value of the product. This is a strong negotiating position. 
* **Continue the positive dialogue:** We acknowledge her willingness to negotiate and maintain a pleasant tone. 

Let's see if Alice accepts this offer or comes back with another counter."
