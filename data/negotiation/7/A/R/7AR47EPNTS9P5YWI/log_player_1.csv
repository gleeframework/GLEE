Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it."", 
  ""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $100 to Bob.  Offering a price slightly below this makes it highly likely he'll consider it seriously. 
* **Above Minimum:** The $95 asking price is well above my $80 minimum, ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me though.  How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both my minimum price ($80) and his perceived value of the product ($100). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  

It's clear there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this lowball offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
  ""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. By suggesting $85, we're splitting the difference between his offer ($70) and my initial ask ($95). This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties.
* **Still Above Minimum:** Importantly, $85 remains comfortably above my $80 minimum and provides a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** This counter-offer also helps gauge how serious Bob is about the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter again. If he's just trying his luck with low offers, he might walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $80 seems fair to me, how about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I might have been able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
