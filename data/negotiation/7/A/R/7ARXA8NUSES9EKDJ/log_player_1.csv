Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Could you consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial value of $120, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm willing to work with you on this."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I believe $130 is still a fair price given the value of the product. Could you possibly meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $130, which is still below my minimum.  I've already countered once, and it seems like further negotiation won't get me closer to my target.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him to ensure I make at least my desired profit."
