"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $18,000 at the moment. Would you consider lowering the price to $16,000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to pay $17,000. Could we perhaps aim for $16,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",16500.0,Bob,4,
