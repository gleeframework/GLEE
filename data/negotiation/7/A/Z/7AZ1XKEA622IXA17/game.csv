"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,800 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $7,900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you consider this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
