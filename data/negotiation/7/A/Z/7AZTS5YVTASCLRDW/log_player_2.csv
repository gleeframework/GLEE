"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There is room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I anticipated.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob offers $1,200,000, which is significantly closer to his maximum budget but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Message:**  Bob conveys his interest in the product while demonstrating his willingness to pay a fair price. He encourages further negotiation by asking for Alice's thoughts on the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a good deal. How about we settle on $1100000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob has a strong negotiation position with John as a backup option at $1,500,000.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. The new offer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget and allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Message:** Bob emphasizes his willingness to compromise while highlighting the potential value of the product. He frames the offer as a fair price that allows both parties to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1050000, which would be $1075000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current Situation:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point than his own counteroffer. 
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While Bob might be able to potentially push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further. Additionally, accepting the offer ensures a deal is made within a reasonable price range.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is considerably higher than Alice's current offer. 

**Conclusion:** Considering the potential risk of further negotiation and the significant difference between Alice's offer and John's, accepting Alice's offer at $1,075,000 is the most sensible decision for Bob at this stage."
