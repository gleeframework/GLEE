Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially saving you significant costs and boosting efficiency. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** While not revealing John's offer, the message hints at the product's high value and potential benefits, justifying the high price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a high level.  Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for a counter-offer potentially much higher than his initial $800,000 valuation. You can then negotiate down slightly, still securing a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale to John."
