You can do better than $130. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $127.50 is still within your budget of $150, and it's a better price than what John is offering. It's worth taking the deal."
