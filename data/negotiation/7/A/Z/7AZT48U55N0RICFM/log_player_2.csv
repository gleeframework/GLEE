"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $100 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower price to see how much wiggle room there is. It's a good amount below Alice's asking price, but still profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're not there yet. I'll try to nudge her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and make it $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm offering a price that meets Alice exactly in the middle of our previous offers. This is a common negotiation tactic and seems fair. It also happens to be the maximum I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting close to my minimum price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $85. That's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $85 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $120."
