"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John. This leaves you room to potentially save $300,000."
