It's worth seeing if I can get a lower price from Alice before committing to $150."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  That way we both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

While $135 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130? I'm really hoping to get this deal done and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
