"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  That way we both walk away feeling good about the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130? I'm really hoping to get this deal done and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
