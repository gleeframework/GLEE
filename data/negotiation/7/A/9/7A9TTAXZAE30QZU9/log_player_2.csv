"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You can get the product for $120 from John, which is your limit.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
