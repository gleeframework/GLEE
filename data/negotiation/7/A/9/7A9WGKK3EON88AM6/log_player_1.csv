Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of the value difference (Bob's value - your value = $200,000) as possible.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum ensures he gets a good deal while maximizing your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.  I'm offering it to you for $1,180,000."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Positive, emphasizes value to Bob.
* **Price:**  $1,180,000 leaves Bob with $20,000 of the potential value, making it highly likely he'll accept.
* **Your Gain:**  You secure $180,000 above your minimum.

**Important Note:** While this offer is likely to be successful, negotiation is complex. Bob could counter-offer, but your fallback position with John gives you strength in the negotiation."
