Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. $9,000 is too low, especially considering the product's value to him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,250. It's a good compromise, and it's still more than what John is offering. I'm happy with this outcome."
