Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level based on his counteroffer. 
* **Strong Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high asking price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. You can afford to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial difference between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to push for a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product extends far beyond its price point. It offers unique advantages that justify a higher investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  By reducing the price to $1,150,000, you demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage further.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  However, the concession isn't drastic. You're still well above Bob's initial offer, reinforcing the product's high value and your strong position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation while staying closer to your $1,000,000 minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,150,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Bob's Valuation:** Bob has now offered $950,000, which is $150,000 more than his initial perceived value of the product. This suggests he's highly motivated to acquire it.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While $950,000 is still below your ideal price, it's very close to your $1,000,000 minimum and significantly better than your alternative with John.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing for more could risk Bob walking away, especially since he's already gone above his initial valuation. 

Accepting this offer secures a very good price for you while ensuring you don't lose the sale to Bob."
