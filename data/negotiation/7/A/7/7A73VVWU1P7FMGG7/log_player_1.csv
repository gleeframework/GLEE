Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, and you don't know if Bob has other options.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Proposition:**  Avoid detailed explanations, focusing on the benefits to Bob.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** This starting point gives you room to negotiate while aiming for a significant portion of that $200,000 surplus.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer."
