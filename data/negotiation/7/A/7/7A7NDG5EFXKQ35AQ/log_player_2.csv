"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still get the product for less from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm on a tight budget.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $9,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, Bob should take that option to save $1,000.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice, as she's unlikely to go lower than $9,000."
