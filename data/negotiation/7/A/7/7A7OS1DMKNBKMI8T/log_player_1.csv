"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,300,000. I'll push back a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob's final offer is still a substantial profit.  Accepting this offer now mitigates the risk of him walking away and me having to settle for John's lower offer."
