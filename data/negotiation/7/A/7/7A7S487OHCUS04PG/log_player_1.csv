"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept, knowing that Bob is likely to counteroffer.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I frame the negotiation as an opportunity for a win-win situation.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer. By rejecting his offer, I show I'm committed to getting a better deal and demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm explicitly suggesting that we're close to a deal and inviting further negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while setting a more realistic price point for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can push Bob a bit further with a counteroffer, considering we are only in round 4 and still have several rounds left.  Additionally, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good fallback option, giving me a buffer in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm continuing to narrow the gap, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a profitable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging by emphasizing the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to take the next step by suggesting we make the deal happen. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm still hoping to push Bob a little higher, especially since I'm already at a point where I could sell to John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  It's time to close this agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it aligns with John's price. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I re-emphasize that this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** I create a sense of urgency by mentioning that it's time to close the agreement, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

At this point, I'm willing to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't agree, so I'm not risking a major loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to offer $925000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob's offer is getting significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I've been pushing for a higher price, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge.  I've already established that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
