"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, as it gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Value Proposition:** I mention the product being ""unique"" and ""valuable"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.** I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price.
* **There are more rounds:** I have time to negotiate and try to get a better price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Move:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $10,000 but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This still allows me to make a profit and hopefully provides you with a good value. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate that this price still gives Bob a good value, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $12500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **More room to negotiate:** There are more rounds, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's offer is still a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Move:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,500 but lower than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try $16,000. This is a fair compromise and still allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** I highlight that $16,000 is a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider it.
* **Cost Coverage:** I mention covering my costs to emphasize that this price is not unreasonable.

**Goal:**  I want to keep the negotiations moving while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I can stretch to $14000. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I still believe I can get a better price.
* **Two rounds left:** I have two more rounds to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Move:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to get him to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise further.
* **Fairness and Value:** I emphasize the fairness of the price and reiterate the value of the product.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone to try and push Bob towards acceptance.

**Goal:**  I want to get a price as close to my minimum as possible, but also aim to close the deal before the round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14500 and my previous offer of $14000. How about $14250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 8, leaving only two rounds before the negotiation automatically ends.  
* **Close to my minimum:**  $14,250 is only $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing out:** There's a risk that Bob might reject my next offer or that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 

By accepting this offer, I can secure a sale that's very close to my minimum price and avoid the risk of getting a lower price or no sale at all."
