"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000. Even though Alice is using sales tactics to try and inflate the perceived value, you save a considerable amount by accepting her offer."
