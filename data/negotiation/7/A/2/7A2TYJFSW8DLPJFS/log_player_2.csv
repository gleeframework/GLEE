Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $675,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than $725,000. Accepting this offer saves us a significant amount compared to John's price."
