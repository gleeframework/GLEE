"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering your desired selling price. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
