"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  How about we meet in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and do $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $130. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $130, though. Let's split the difference again and go with $120. It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with that.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm offering it to you for $135. This is my final offer.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  It's only a small difference, and I think we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to budge any further, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I think $130 is as low as I can go. I'm going to have to stop negotiating and move on. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $80, and I think that's a fair price.",80.0,Alice,9,
