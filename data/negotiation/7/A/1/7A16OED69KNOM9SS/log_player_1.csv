"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $10 difference from my minimum allows for some back and forth. 
* **Time is Money:**  I want to see if I can close the deal quickly, as I have the option to sell to John for $120 at any point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$130 is close to my minimum:** While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** The fact that Bob made a counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have 9 rounds left, which is plenty of time to see if I can get a better price.  

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my original offer of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135? It's a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing this as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing that it's a compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my target:**  Bob's offer is only $2 away from my initial offer of $140 and $12 more than selling to John. 
* **Time is a factor:**  I've already gone through several rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  By accepting, I can potentially build a relationship with Bob and create opportunities for future business.

While I'd love to get closer to $140, accepting $132 seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
