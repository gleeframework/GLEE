"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. My initial offer is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
