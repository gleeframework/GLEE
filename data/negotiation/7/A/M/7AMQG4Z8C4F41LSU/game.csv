"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8,500 is the lowest I can go. This is already a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
