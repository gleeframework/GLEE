Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a good midpoint between our last offers.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair agreement, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000.

This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
