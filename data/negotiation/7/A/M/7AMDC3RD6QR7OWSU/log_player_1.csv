{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $140 is higher than Bob's $120 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your $150 minimum, so you're still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go lower if Bob counteroffers, but you have some bargaining power. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still above Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of losing money. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and while I'm happy to negotiate,  $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $135. How about we meet at $132? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is still below my preferred price, it's very close to my minimum. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit while still closing the deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him walking away, and selling to John would only result in a marginally better outcome."
