"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider selling it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While the product is valuable, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we agree on $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects its worth.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
