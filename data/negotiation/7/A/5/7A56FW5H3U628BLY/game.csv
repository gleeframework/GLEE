"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $2,000,000. This is significantly less than my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find a middle ground.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $1,900,000?  This is a final offer from my side, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
