"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob wants to pay as little as possible. $14,000 is a significant amount above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Bob has a good starting point for negotiation as he's willing to pay more than Alice's minimum.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This ensures Bob won't be left without the product, but it's the least desirable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the opportunity. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Reasonable offer:** $12,500 is a fair compromise, considering Alice's minimum price and Bob's maximum.
* **Positive tone:** The message is polite and suggests a desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12,500. How about we discuss $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to Bob's desired price, $13,500 is still above his ideal target.
* **Further negotiation is likely.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, indicating that a deal within Bob's budget could be possible.
* **John's offer is still a fallback option.** It's important to keep the possibility of purchasing from John in mind, especially if negotiations with Alice stall."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Would you consider $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** $13,000 is still within Bob's maximum budget and represents a slight increase from his previous offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $13,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,500. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
