"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the opportunity. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12,500. How about we discuss $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Would you consider $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $13,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,500. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,
