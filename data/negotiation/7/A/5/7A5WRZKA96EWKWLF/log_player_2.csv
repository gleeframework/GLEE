"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still a lot higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000, meaning there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. This allows for some wiggle room for Alice to accept while also giving Bob a substantial discount.  This is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  While it's closer to the middle ground, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  However, he's still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and there's still potential to reach a mutually beneficial price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation process open and allows Bob to continue striving for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but still keeping it well below Alice's last offer. This demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay an unreasonable price. This counteroffer is a good middle ground to potentially reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high.  Bob is already pushing the limits of his budget, and accepting would mean he's not maximizing his savings. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since there are limited rounds remaining.  If Alice won't budge, Bob might need to consider the option of buying from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant jump in his offer this round.  This demonstrates his strong interest in the product but also a firm stance on his price limit.  Since this is round 8, time is getting tight. Bob needs to find a price point where Alice might be willing to compromise, and $1,200,000 is potentially a good midpoint between their current positions. This counteroffer is a strong push toward a deal, but if Alice still rejects, Bob will need to consider his options carefully."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly the same price as buying from John.  This means there is no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice.  Bob is running out of time and will not be able to get a better deal.  Since both options cost the same, it's more logical to buy from John, as there is no risk of Alice rejecting the offer and leaving Bob with nothing."
