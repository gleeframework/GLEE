"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a significant discount. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price.  The message also expresses continued interest in the product, keeping the deal alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already come down from $120 to $110.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it's within his budget and saves him $10 compared to John's offer.  Accepting the offer is the best move in this situation."
