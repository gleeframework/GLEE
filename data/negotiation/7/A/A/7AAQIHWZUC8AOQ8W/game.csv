"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings. However, $1,100,000 falls quite short of what I consider a fair deal.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
