"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
