Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,200,000, but she states this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Since you can buy the product from John for the same price without further negotiation, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid any potential for the deal with Alice to fall through."
