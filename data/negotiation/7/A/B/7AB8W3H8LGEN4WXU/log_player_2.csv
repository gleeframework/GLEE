It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're still willing to pay more than John, so there's room to negotiate."

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower to close the deal."

Alice's offer of $10,900 is getting close to my budget, but it's still a bit higher than what I want to pay. I can save $900 by going with John, so that's the better decision."
