``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's offering a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000 but still within his budget of $15,000.
* This counteroffer creates a space for negotiation and gives Bob a better chance of getting a lower price than Alice's initial offer."

* Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
