"I've made concessions, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll be getting is $15000. I think this is a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,7,
