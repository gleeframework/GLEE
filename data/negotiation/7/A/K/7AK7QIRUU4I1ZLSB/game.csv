"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some middle ground. Would you be open to a price of $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to a comfortable price point, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000. It's a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
