Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $975,000 just yet.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to a comfortable price point, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I can offer the product to you for $1,025,000. It's a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000 (her value). At this point, accepting her offer of $1,025,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of her increasing the price in later rounds."
