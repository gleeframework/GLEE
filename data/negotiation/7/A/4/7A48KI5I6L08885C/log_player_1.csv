I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant profit for me, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob while still leaving me a good amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and higher than selling to John. It's likely that Bob won't budge much further, so I'll take this deal."
