"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $2,000 by rejecting Alice's offer.  There's a strong incentive to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and he is willing to pay up to $12,000.  By offering $9,000, Bob is  offering a price that is a good compromise and gives Alice a decent profit.  This also gives Bob room to negotiate further if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still better off rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is less than John's price,  there's still room for Alice to come down further.  Bob can continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better deal.  This is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, there are still a few rounds left.  If Bob rejects, he can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. While buying from John is an option, it's still more advantageous for Bob to continue with Alice, given that there's still room to bargain for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer but still trying to save money.  He's increasing his counteroffer to $10,000, hoping Alice will see that he's willing to meet her halfway.  This offer is also a good compromise, as it's lower than Alice's latest offer but higher than Bob's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than John's, the risk of further counteroffers and rejections is high. It's more likely that Alice will either hold firm at her current price or increase it further. 

In this situation, Bob is better off securing the product from John for $12,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and while not the absolute best price, it's a reasonable compromise given the limited time and the risk of a worse outcome with Alice."
