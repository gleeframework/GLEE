"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,125?",13125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's meet at $13,500. This is the best I can do.",13500.0,Alice,5,
