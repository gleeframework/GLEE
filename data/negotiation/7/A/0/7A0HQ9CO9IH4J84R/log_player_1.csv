{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It is also a price that is significantly less than the product is worth to Bob, leaving him with a good margin for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $9,500?  That would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 9500}
