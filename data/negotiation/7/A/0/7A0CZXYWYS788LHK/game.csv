"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for its value.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",10500.0,Alice,3,
