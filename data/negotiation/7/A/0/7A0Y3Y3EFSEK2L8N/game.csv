"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Can we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is too low for me.  Could you do $9,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit far from $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $7,500. Can we discuss further?",7500.0,Bob,4,
