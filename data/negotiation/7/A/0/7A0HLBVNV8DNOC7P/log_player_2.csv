"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that you'd still be making a profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and the deal could fall through, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Compromise:** $13,000 represents a compromise that is likely to be acceptable to both parties. 

Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price, avoiding the risk of a further negotiation breakdown."
