"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it'd be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be as fair as possible, but I can't go lower than $92. That's my final offer.  I'm confident this is a great price for you, and it would be a shame to lose out on this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $92 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
