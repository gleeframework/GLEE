"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to you. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and desires, is priced at $950,000. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, and I believe this price reflects the exceptional quality and utility of the item while allowing you to secure it within your budget. I look forward to discussing the details further and understanding how we can proceed together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

This is a classic negotiation scenario. Here's why rejecting Alice's offer is the best move:

* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is your maximum price.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative. There's a good chance she might lower the price if you reject her initial offer.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay above your budget and open the door for further negotiation or a better counter-offer."
