"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to accept $13,000?  "", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $13,500. This is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.** John's offer is for $15,000, making Alice's offer the better option.
* **Continuing to negotiate may not lead to a significantly better price.** There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and Bob could end up paying more by delaying. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it balances saving money with avoiding potential risks."
