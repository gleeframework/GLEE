"I'm interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1,700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,700,000 and $1,800,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
