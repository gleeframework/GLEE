"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to consider the value that I've placed on this product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my budget. It's a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
