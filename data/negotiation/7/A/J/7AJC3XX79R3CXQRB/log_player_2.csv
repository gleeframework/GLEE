"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and high-demand item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high. You have a significant buffer before needing to resort to John's offer. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to consider the value that I've placed on this product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still too high.  While she has moved slightly, it's still significantly above your target. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a more favorable price.  There's still room to bargain, and you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my budget. It's a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
