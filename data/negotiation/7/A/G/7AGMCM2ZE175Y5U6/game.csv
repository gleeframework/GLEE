"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This will give us both a good deal and allows us to finalize this purchase.",925000.0,Bob,4,
