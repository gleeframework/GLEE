Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit. 

I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his proposed price. 

It's also important to remember I have the option to sell to John for $100 at any point. If negotiations with Bob become too lengthy or unproductive, I can always fall back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a good profit. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer my initial asking price, this offer is significantly better than selling to John for $100. 

This negotiation has taken several rounds and it's likely that further counteroffers will only result in more back-and-forth, potentially leading to a breakdown.  

The offer of $135 allows me to achieve a reasonable profit and close the deal with Bob."
