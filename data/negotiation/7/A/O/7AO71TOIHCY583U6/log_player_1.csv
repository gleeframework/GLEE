Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, maximizing her profit while staying above her minimum price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a price higher than $12,000.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more likely to accept even at a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring she doesn't lose money."
