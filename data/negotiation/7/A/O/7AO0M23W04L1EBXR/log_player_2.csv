Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $620,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating but is holding firm on her bottom line. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk she won't budge further. Accepting the $620,000 offer secures a significant discount from both her original price and John's backup option."
