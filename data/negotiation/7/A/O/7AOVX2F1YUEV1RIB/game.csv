"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. This aligns more closely with my valuation and budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully, and while I appreciate the reduction, I'd like to propose a price of $960,000. This offers a good balance between our respective positions and remains within my budget constraints.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I can't quite meet your offer of $960,000,  I'm prepared to come down to $965,000. This represents a further compromise on my part and reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize this deal at a price that benefits us both.",965000.0,Alice,5,
