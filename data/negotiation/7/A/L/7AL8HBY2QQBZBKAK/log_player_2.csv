"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John for $1,000,000 is the best financial decision."
