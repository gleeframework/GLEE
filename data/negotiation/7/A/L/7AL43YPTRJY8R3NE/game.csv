"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit high for what I had in mind.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
