"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,750,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering his estimated $1,000,000 value, leaving him room for profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the benefits of the product and create a sense of opportunity. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and then gradually lower the price if necessary while monitoring Bob's response and maintaining the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a desirable result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to pay $1400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and continue negotiating.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price by counteroffering.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will carefully consider a counteroffer that is lower than my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a balance that is attractive to Bob while maximizing my own profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired value for this product.  However, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000, which is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Compromise & Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise and highlighting the mutual benefits. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still keeping it high enough to ensure a favorable outcome for me. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually lower the price while maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm aiming for a price that's acceptable to Bob while ensuring I achieve a satisfactory profit.  I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response and will be prepared to adjust my offer as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, and I am willing to pay $1550000 for it. This price reflects my assessment of its worth while also being reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Factor:**  We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Bob and potentially missing out on selling to John.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation, there's no guarantee that will happen, and I could end up with a lower price or a deal falling through.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice.  It provides me with a satisfactory profit, minimizes the risk of losing the deal, and allows me to close the transaction quickly."
