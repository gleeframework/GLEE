""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower allows for the possibility of a quicker sale and slightly higher profit if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,999 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob while ensuring you don't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage in this negotiation. 

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a shrewd negotiator, he might try to lowball you. However, this offer presents a strong starting point and maximizes your potential profit."
