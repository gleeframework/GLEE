Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's unlikely Bob will immediately accept. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and builds a sense of value for the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested.
* **Plan B:** I have a backup buyer in John, guaranteeing a minimum of $8,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if negotiations don't yield a satisfactory price."
