"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I know this is a bit above my floor price, but I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
