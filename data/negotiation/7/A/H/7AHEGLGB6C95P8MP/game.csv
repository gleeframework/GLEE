"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $11200 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on this one.",10500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and $10500, which would be $10850. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10850.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $10800 as the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",10800.0,Bob,6,,
