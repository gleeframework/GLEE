"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,032,500?",1032500.0,Alice,7,
