Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,032,500?

Alice seems firm on her price, and while I could try to negotiate further, $1,032,500 is a reasonable price for the product. It's significantly less than John's offer and allows me to stay well within my budget.  It's time to close the deal."
