"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Confident Tone:** Using phrases like ""unique value"" and ""fair price"" aim to reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind, potentially pushing him closer to my target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to earn significantly more from Bob. This initial offer is a calculated risk to explore that potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your perspective on its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000 to reflect what I believe is a fair valuation based on market standards and my personal assessment of the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum. While I could accept and secure the sale, there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim to push the price higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns it can generate. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the immense value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  I want to keep the negotiation collaborative and acknowledge his offer wasn't disregarded.
* **Holding Firm:** While I'm coming down in price, the decrease is substantial, demonstrating willingness to negotiate without giving up too much ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential, aiming to shift Bob's focus from the price tag to the value he'll gain. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""compromise,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that we're not aligned on its worth. I would like to propose an offer of $1,750,000. This amount reflects a reasonable compromise between our respective valuations and allows me to consider purchasing the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to push a bit further since Bob is clearly engaged and increasing his offers. I'll use my next counteroffer to aim for a price closer to $1,900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a serious interest in this product. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** Continuing to acknowledge Bob's engagement keeps the tone positive.
* **Finality:**  By introducing this counteroffer as ""final,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency and suggesting this is my best offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting my own significant price reduction emphasizes the value Bob is getting and encourages him to agree. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  This phrasing aims to frame the deal as a win-win,  making it more palatable for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we've been able to negotiate. I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,850,000. This amount aims to find a balance between our respective valuations and respects my budgetary constraints while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,850,000 is a solid price and significantly exceeds my minimum and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offers, demonstrating genuine interest. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. This offer represents a favorable balance between potential profit and deal security."
