"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $850,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you.  $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
