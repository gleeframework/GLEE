"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $155?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $155. How about $137.50?,137.5,Bob,4,
