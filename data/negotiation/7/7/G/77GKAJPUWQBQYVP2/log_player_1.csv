Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I want to find a price that feels fair. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,750? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,750 is a good compromise. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
