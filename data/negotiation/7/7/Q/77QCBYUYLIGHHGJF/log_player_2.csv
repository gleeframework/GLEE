"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate, especially since Alice is open to it. There's a chance you can get the product for less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to sell the product to you, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $137.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $137.50, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's not a huge savings, but it's better than paying the full $150.  I'd rather avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
