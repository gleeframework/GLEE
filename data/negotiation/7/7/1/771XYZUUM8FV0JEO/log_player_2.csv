"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a healthy margin for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it still leaves room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  He has a good chance of getting a better deal than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This allows for a reasonable profit for me and a significant savings for you.  Let's see if we can strike a deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price point.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiations."
