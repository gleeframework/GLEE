"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for you and a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This allows for a reasonable profit for me and a significant savings for you.  Let's see if we can strike a deal here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
