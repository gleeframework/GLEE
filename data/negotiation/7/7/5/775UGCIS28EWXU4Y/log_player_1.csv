Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer.  It's also a good starting point as it's higher than the value I've placed on the product, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $75. I understand if this isn't possible, but I wanted to see if we could come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $82.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick closer to my initial budget of $75. I am willing to consider $80 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 matches what I would get from John, and is within my minimum acceptable price range. I'll accept his offer."
