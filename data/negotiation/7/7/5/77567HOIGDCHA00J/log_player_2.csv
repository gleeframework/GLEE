"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $200,000."
