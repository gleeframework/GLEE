Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a $1,500 discount, which is a significant amount for him. It also leaves me with a $500 profit, which is better than selling to John for $10,000. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Attract Bob:** The discount makes the offer attractive to Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting.
* **Secure a Profit:** The price is still higher than Bob's perceived value, ensuring a profit for me.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, I have room to negotiate further while still remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still a good deal.  Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer, and selling to him guarantees a sale.  I can always try to find a better deal later, but there's no guarantee that another buyer will be as interested."
