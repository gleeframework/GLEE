Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Fair Offer:**  The message positions the price as a fair deal, emphasizing the value Bob would receive.

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price significantly above your fallback option (John's offer)."
