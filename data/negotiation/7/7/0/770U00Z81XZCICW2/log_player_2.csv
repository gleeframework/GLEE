Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While your offer is strong, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value than that.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on this price, I will unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position and I value your business.  I've considered your offer carefully. To avoid wasting any more of your time, I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll understand, but I'll need to explore other options.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll counter again, but I'm definitely leaning towards buying from John if we can't close this deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,100,000.

If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
