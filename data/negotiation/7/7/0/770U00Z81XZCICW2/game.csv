"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it will be transformative for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value both of us place on this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While your offer is strong, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value than that.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on this price, I will unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position and I value your business.  I've considered your offer carefully. To avoid wasting any more of your time, I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll understand, but I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
