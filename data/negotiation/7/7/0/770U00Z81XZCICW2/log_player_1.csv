""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it will be transformative for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value both of us place on this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, it's too early to settle.  I'll aim higher with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While your offer is strong, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value than that.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on this price, I will unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but his latest message suggests a degree of flexibility. I'll counter again, but I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and I value your business.  I've considered your offer carefully. To avoid wasting any more of your time, I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll understand, but I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price, and I'm running out of time to secure a significantly better deal. Accepting $1,100,000 is a good outcome."
