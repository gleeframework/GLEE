"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is 50% higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate and encourages him to consider the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still 8 rounds left to potentially get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $12,000, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. Accepting his offer at $11,000 will secure a sale for me that's significantly better than selling to John. There's always the risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer and I might end up with John's offer, but it's time to take a calculated risk."
