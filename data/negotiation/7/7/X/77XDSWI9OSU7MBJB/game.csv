"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand $13,500 is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that.  If you're willing to consider $12,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. It's still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the last price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
