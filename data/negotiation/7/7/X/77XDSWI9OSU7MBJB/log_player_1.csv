Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
