"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110.
* **It's cheaper than John:**  John wants $120, so buying from Alice saves you $10.

Even though you'd ideally get it for less, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision in this scenario."
