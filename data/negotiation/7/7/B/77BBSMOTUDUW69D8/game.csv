"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? This would be a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $11,250 is still below what I need.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
