"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $105? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $105.  Since you can get the product for $100 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
