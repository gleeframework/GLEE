Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **50% Markup:** The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price.  This is a common starting point in negotiations where the product's value is less quantifiable.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know your minimum.  A skilled negotiator might try to lowball you. Be prepared to counter-offer and potentially walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your starting price to be less aggressive. However, remember, you always have John as a backup buyer."
