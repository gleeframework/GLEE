Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $149 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Maintain Believability:**  While we want a high price, going too close to $150 might seem suspicious or too inflexible to Bob.  $149 feels like a ""real"" price someone might set. 

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, knowing the product is only worth $80 to him. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still maintaining a degree of plausibility."
