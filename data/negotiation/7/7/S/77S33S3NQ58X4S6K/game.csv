"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss further?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's find a way to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal. Can we shake hands on that?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $105, but I'm willing to go up to $100. If we can close at that price, I think it'll be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
