Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly lower than that. I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a reasonable price, considering the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept the offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm not thrilled about selling it to Bob for $850,000. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $850,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $875,000}

This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I've already rejected Bob's offer once before, and he's sticking to his original price. I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000, as it's still below my minimum price.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is the price I was hoping to get all along."
