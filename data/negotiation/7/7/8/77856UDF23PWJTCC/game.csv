"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8400. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7500 and $8400. How about we try $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8200. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your last offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8100. Can you consider that?",8100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8150. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8150.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $8100. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8100.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8150. I think we've reached a stalemate, and I'm starting to consider other options. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $8150. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",8150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're considering other options, Alice, but I'm still very interested in the product. I'm willing to make one last offer of $8100. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities, and I'm sure John is still waiting for me to buy from him.",8100.0,Bob,10,
