Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your perspective. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between the value we both seek in this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is at $850,000 which is only $50,000 more than what John is selling for.  There's a good chance you can still negotiate lower, but it's also a good deal for you, and risking further negotiation could result in Alice rejecting and pushing the price up again. It's better to accept and secure the deal now."
