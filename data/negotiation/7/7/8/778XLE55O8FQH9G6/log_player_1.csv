"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the maximum profit, so we begin significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high asking price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first round is largely about information gathering.  Bob's response will reveal how much he desires the product and how aggressively he'll negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than your initial ask and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.  Bob's willingness to jump so high suggests he might be willing to go even higher. We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. It seems we both see the considerable value in this product. While your offer is tempting, I believe $2,100,000 reflects its true worth more accurately. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've come down from the initial high price, indicating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain Strength:** The decrease isn't drastic, signaling that we're serious about a higher value and not desperate to close the deal immediately.
* **Open Communication:** We invite Bob's thoughts, fostering a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming for a final price somewhere between $1,800,000 and $2,100,000,  trying to maximize our profit while still leaving Bob with a deal he feels is acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. While $1,950,000 is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, we are still in early rounds. There's room for Bob to potentially go higher, and we haven't reached a point where accepting his offer is more beneficial than a potential deal with John. Let's keep negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the significant value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,050,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your serious interest."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minor Concession:**  We've come down by a smaller amount ($50,000) compared to Bob's larger jump ($150,000). This shows flexibility but also maintains that we're not willing to make drastic concessions.
* **Middle Ground Emphasis:**  The message frames the offer as a fair compromise, highlighting the collaborative spirit.
* **Time Factor:**  We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations.  Keeping the price slightly higher for now maintains room for adjustment in later rounds if necessary. 
* **John as Leverage:** The safety net of John's offer allows us to be more assertive in pursuing a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture in the negotiation. Bob's increase is smaller this round ($50,000), which might signal that he's reaching his upper limit.  However, we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to test Bob's absolute limit.  We'll take a calculated risk and counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above the $1,900,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To demonstrate my own commitment to finding an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. I believe this is a very fair offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession this round, dropping $75,000, to signal that we're serious about closing the deal.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While the drop is significant, we're still asking for a price significantly higher than Bob's current offer and comfortably above John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing this as our final offer, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer aims to be the final push before potentially accepting one of Bob's subsequent offers (if he doesn't accept this one). We're aiming for that sweet spot where Bob feels he's getting a good deal while you maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1,925,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's increases are getting smaller, indicating he's nearing his maximum.  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.
* **Time Value:**  We're running out of rounds.  If we reject this offer and don't reach an agreement with Bob in the next two rounds, we'll be forced to accept John's lower offer.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,925,000 is a substantial profit above your minimum and a good deal considering Bob's perceived value. It's a win-win scenario where both parties feel satisfied. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a great price while avoiding the risk of losing out on a deal with Bob altogether."
