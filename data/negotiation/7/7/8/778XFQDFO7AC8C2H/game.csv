"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you offering the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair price, considering I'm already paying more than your desired selling price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think!",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $8,900.  That's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,900. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,100. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $8,950.  That's a very fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer at this point.  Let's close this deal!",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,9,
