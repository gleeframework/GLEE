"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we start at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm going to counter with $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with $13500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can make a deal",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with $14000 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a premium service package worth $1000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal",14000.0,Alice,7,
