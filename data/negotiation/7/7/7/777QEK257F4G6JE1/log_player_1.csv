Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.  This is a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
