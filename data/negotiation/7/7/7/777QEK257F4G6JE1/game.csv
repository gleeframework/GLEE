"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below what the product is worth to me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  I'm still a ways off from that number though.  How about $950,000?  That's a substantial sum and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.  This is a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
