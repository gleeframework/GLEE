"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer you $6,500.  I believe this offer considers both our valuations.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
