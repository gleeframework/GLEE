"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,325,000. Can we discuss this further?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
