"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest.  While $1250000 is closer,  I'm still committed to achieving a price that reflects the true value of this product.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. $1275000 is getting very close to what I can afford. However, I'm still hoping to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1262500. This price represents a significant opportunity for you to secure a sale while still staying within my budget constraints.
