"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to make a deal, $18,000 is a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $17,500 is cutting it a bit too close for me.  I could let it go for $18,500.  It's a fair offer for a valuable product.  What do you say?",18500.0,Alice,5,
