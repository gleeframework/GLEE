Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value. I'm confident you'll find it a good investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the potential need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Exploring John's option:**  I'm also keeping John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a safety net, in case negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but still below my minimum price, with the aim of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being attractive to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Positive and hopeful tone:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes the possibility of reaching an agreement.

**Note:**

* This is a strategic counteroffer that signals a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a firm stance on my minimum requirements.
* The next step will depend on Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy, considering John's offer and the possibility of further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the edge:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. However, it's still below that threshold.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, I risk having to make further concessions. There's no guarantee he will accept any price closer to my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is a more reliable and less risky option, given the potential for Bob to reject any further counteroffers.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm close to reaching an agreement with Bob, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it. John's offer guarantees a satisfactory outcome, and it's the best choice at this point in the negotiation."
