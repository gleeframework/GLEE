Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room for compromise. 

Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $800,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, his offers are getting increasingly lower. It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's good for me. To avoid further time wasted in negotiations, I will sell the product to John for $800,000."
