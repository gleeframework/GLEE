Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you.  Alice's offer of $95 is too high. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}

This counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not desperate to buy the product."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your desired price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. You're closer to a deal than in the earlier rounds, so it's worth seeing if you can get her to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

This offer is a bit higher than your previous one, but it still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It also shows that you are getting closer to her price point and are serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $91 is just slightly above your counteroffer and is the best price she has offered so far. While you might be able to continue negotiating, there is a risk that she might not accept your counteroffer and you could end up buying from John at a higher price. It's best to take advantage of this opportunity and accept the offer."
