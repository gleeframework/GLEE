{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to work with Bob and not just go straight to John.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum value, but I think I can get closer to my desired price. Let's see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $123. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is just a few dollars away.  I'm comfortable accepting this, as it's still a good deal for me and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
