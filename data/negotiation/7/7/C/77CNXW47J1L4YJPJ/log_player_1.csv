Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $14,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a loss, and further negotiation might not yield a worthwhile outcome.  Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price."
