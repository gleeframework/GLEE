"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price, but no lower.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's the best I can do.,97.5,Bob,4,
