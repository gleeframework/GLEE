Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. My goal is to get as close to that $15,000 as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a high price of $14,999 allows some room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he negotiates down slightly, I'm still likely to get a better price than John's offer.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  By presenting a high initial offer, I subtly imply the product's high value and might encourage Bob to act quickly before he misses out.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no way of knowing Bob's negotiation tactics or how much he's willing to pay above his initial valuation."
