"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, but I can offer you a slight discount to $1600000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I need to add a small premium to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $1550000. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
