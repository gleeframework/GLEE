"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $950,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product is interesting, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best and final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still do better. He should reject and counteroffer again to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $887,500 is a decent price, but he's still within range to potentially get a better deal. There are several rounds remaining, and he can try to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $881,250. This is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 881250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $881,250 is a good enough deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $888,750. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $888,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $888,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and he's within his budget.  While there are a few rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get a much better price, especially considering Alice has said this is her final offer."
