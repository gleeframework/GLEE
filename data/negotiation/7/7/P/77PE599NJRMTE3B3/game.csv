"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product is interesting, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best and final offer in this range.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $881,250. This is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",881250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $881,250 is a good enough deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $888,750. This is my final offer in this range.",888750.0,Alice,7,
