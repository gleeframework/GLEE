"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $14,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is within his budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  $13,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $14,000? That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is closer to his target, it's still higher than he'd like to pay. He's willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $13,750?  It's closer to your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13750}
