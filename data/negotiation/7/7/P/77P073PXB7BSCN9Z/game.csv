,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  $13,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $14,000? That gives us both a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $13,750?  It's closer to your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13750.0,Bob,4,
