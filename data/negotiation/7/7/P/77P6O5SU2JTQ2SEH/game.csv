"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1350000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1450000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
