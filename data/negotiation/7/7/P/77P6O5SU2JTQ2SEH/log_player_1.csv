Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while still conveying my own confidence in the product's worth.  

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** This establishes a baseline for negotiation. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The $100,000 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value provides space for compromise.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer than his initial offer, it's still below my floor of $1,500,000.
* **I have a better alternative.**  I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a more profitable option. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum requirement, hoping to close the gap and potentially secure a deal with him. However, I will also keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,450,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the price reduction and presents the offer as a fair compromise, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I am slowly decreasing my offer, attempting to close the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I am mindful of John's offer and will be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe there's room for further discussion. I am willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.** This means I won't get a better deal with him. 
* **Selling to John is only a $100,000 gain.** While this is a good profit, it's not significantly more than what I can get from Bob right now.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting Bob's offer saves me time and effort in further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

Since I have a good alternative, I can afford to be patient. However, in this situation, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is minimal, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is high. It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
