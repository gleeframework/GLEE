I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds of negotiation."

While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with,  I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. I'm only three rounds away from being able to sell to John for $1,200,000. I'll see if I can get Bob up a little higher."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm happy with with Bob, we only have two rounds left. If I don't close the deal with Bob in the next two rounds, I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing a sale for a much higher price."
