"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  $7500 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to reach my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Alice,3,
