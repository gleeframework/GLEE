"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,280,000 is still a little steep. I'm prepared to pay $1,260,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,270,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
