Alice's offer:

While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly from $1,250,000.  At this point, accepting her offer would still mean overpaying by $250,000 compared to John's offer. Buying from John ensures the best price and avoids further negotiation."
