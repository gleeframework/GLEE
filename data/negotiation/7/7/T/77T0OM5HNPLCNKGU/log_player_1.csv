I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000. While I'm getting closer to my bottom line with Bob, we're running out of rounds, and I need to secure a price that meets my minimum requirements. John's offer guarantees that I'll get at least $10,000, which is my minimum, and eliminates the risk of Bob continuing to haggle for a lower price."
