"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value we're both looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still very interested, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $720,000.  What do you think?",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $720,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",780000.0,Alice,5,
