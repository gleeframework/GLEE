"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000).  I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob or secure my minimum value with John.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value we're both looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still very interested, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $720,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still above my minimum value of $1,200,000 with John, so I can afford to keep negotiating with Bob.  $720,000 is closer to my target, but there's still room to bargain.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $720,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 780000}
