Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. His response will dictate my next move. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a reliable backup who will buy the product for my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Bob's counteroffer, while below my desired price, indicates genuine interest in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is higher than his stated value ($8,000), suggesting he might be willing to go even higher.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John allows me to be firmer in negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still above it to leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  While I didn't accept Bob's ""middle ground,"" I'm signaling flexibility by moving closer to his price. This might encourage him to move closer to mine.
* **Above Minimum:** The $11,000 price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and provides a decent profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how much further Bob is willing to go.  If he rejects this, I might consider a smaller concession or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but only slightly. This suggests he might be hesitant to go much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing the guaranteed sale to John. Time spent on a potentially unsuccessful negotiation is time I could be using to finalize the deal with John. 
* **Meeting My Needs:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob in further rounds. 

**Conclusion:** While there's a chance I could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk. Selling to John is the safest and most efficient way to achieve my goal of maximizing profit within my acceptable range."
