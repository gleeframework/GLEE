"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item, I think it would really be valuable to you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $110.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $110 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $160 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $130? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is close, but I need to get at least $145 for this to make sense for me.  That's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $135, but that's my absolute limit.",135.0,Bob,6,
