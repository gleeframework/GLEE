"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's below your valuation and within my budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look at other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
