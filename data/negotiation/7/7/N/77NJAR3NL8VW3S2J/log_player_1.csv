"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it holds immense value for you. I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a significantly high offer ($2,200,000) to establish a strong anchoring point. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000).
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and provide insights into his negotiation strategy. His response will determine my next move. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John at any time for my minimum price.  This knowledge allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm seeking a higher value and provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession by decreasing my price by $300,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still striving for a price above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the counteroffer by highlighting the inherent value of the product, subtly reinforcing its worth. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By proposing a price point between our previous offers, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and encourage a response within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but it's still below my target. While the difference is getting smaller, I believe there's a chance to negotiate a better price. I'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving but also signals my willingness to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,800,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I need to be realistic about the value I'm offering. Please let me know your decision soon, as I have other potential buyers I need to consider."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to signal a firm stance.  
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my price to $1,800,000, showing some movement but remaining above my absolute minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Introducing a sense of urgency and mentioning ""other potential buyers"" (even though John's offer matches my minimum) adds a subtle pressure for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Walk-Away Preparedness:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away from this deal if Bob doesn't accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm content knowing I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reverted back to his previous offer of $1,600,000 and declared it as his final offer. This suggests we've reached a stalemate, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting John's offer ensures a favorable outcome and avoids the potential for a lower offer from Bob or the deal falling through entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and effort.  It's time to cut my losses and proceed with the guaranteed sale to John."
