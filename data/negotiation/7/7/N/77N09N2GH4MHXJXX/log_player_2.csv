"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $110, which is less than John's price of $120.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:**  Bob values the product at $120, while Alice values it at $80.  This means there's room for a deal that benefits both parties. 

Since Bob can get a better price from Alice, it makes sense to accept her offer."
