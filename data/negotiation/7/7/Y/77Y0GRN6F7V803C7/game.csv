"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe will be of immense value to you. I know you're familiar with it, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering its true value and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts. ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
