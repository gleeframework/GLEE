# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 and John is selling for $150, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price point."
