"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more advantageous for me.  Would you consider $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm afraid $450,000 is still below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price, Bob. However, $500,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",525000.0,Alice,5,
