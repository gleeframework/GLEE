"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm afraid $450,000 is still below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price, Bob. However, $500,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's a reasonable price at $275,000 below my maximum valuation.  Continuing to negotiate risks either a stalemate or pushing Alice away from the table entirely."
