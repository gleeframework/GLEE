"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I want to see if I can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This price still reflects a significant profit for you, while also being a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  I'm determined to get the best price possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, accepting this offer still saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
