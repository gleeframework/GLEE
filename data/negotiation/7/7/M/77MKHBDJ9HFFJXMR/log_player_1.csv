**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiations. Here's why:

* **Bob's Alternatives:** Bob mentions he might buy a similar product from John for $800,000. Even if this is a bluff, it indicates Bob has other options and is feeling the pressure.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're unlikely to see significant movement from Bob at this stage. Holding out for another $25,000 carries the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value.  Prolonging negotiations delays the benefits of the sale.

Accepting $975,000 ensures a profit and avoids the potential loss of the sale."
