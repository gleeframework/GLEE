"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I could let it go for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.  I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I've considered your offer carefully, and $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. I'm confident it will be worth your investment, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to considering buying the product from John for $800,000. I'd like to make one final offer of $975,000, and I hope we can close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,8,
