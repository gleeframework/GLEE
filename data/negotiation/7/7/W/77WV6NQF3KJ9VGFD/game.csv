"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $160, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $140 is still below my minimum. How about $145? This gives us both a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction.",145.0,Alice,5,
