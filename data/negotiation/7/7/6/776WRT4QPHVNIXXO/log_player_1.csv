Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I need to stick to my budget.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair offer considering it's still well above your perceived value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's $300,000 more than John's offer and a healthy profit margin over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer further. 
* **Bird in the Hand:**  A sure $1,100,000 is better than the uncertainty of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's offer."
