"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $500,000 for this product.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $500,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the reduction, $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to spend. This product fits into a specific budget for me, and I'm willing to offer  $650,000 to make this work.  This is a fair offer, considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground. Considering its unique value, I can come down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while hopefully still aligning with the value you see in the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value of this product. It's clear you recognize its potential.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a considerable compromise and my absolute limit.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
