Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but this is my final offer.  Think about the value you'll get, and let's close this deal. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm on a price that's significantly higher than your backup option with John.  She's even introduced a sense of urgency and a ""final offer"" tactic. While she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue. You're better off securing the $10,000 deal with John than potentially ending up with no deal or a deal that's still above your ideal price point."
