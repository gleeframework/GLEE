Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $150 is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation open. I'm confident in the product's value, but I'm also willing to consider Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is not a realistic starting point.
* **Focus on value:** I need to emphasize the product's worth and potentially provide more details to justify a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This still allows me to make a fair profit while hopefully remaining within your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** $100 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that allows me to sell the product for a reasonable profit.
* **Reiterate value:** I've emphasized the product's worth by mentioning a ""fair profit,"" subtly reminding Bob of its value.
* **Appeal to Bob's budget:** I've addressed Bob's budget concerns by offering a price that's potentially more appealing. 

This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's initial offer, while remaining firm on my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made significant concessions. 
* **Secure a guaranteed price:**  John offers a reliable price that meets my minimum requirements.

Considering the value of the product and the likelihood that further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a higher price, selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation."
