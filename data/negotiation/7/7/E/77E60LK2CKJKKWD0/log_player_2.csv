"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and hopefully allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's slightly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's desired price point. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and represents a significant drop from her initial offer. Accepting this offer would be a good deal for Bob, saving him $1,200 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers or that the negotiation process could drag on, leading to a wasted opportunity."
