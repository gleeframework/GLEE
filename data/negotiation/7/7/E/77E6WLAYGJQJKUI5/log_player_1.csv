Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum ensures a higher likelihood of him accepting immediately. This is preferable to going lower and risking him rejecting it, forcing you to sell to John for $100.

By setting the price at $130, you create a win-win situation where you make a significant profit, and Bob gets the product at a price lower than its value to him."
