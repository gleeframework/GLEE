While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. There's still a good chance of getting closer to my target price."

While I'm disappointed I didn't get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is within a reasonable range.  It's also close to my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
