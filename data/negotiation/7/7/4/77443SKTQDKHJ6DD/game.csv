"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming to stay under $1,200,000. I propose a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
