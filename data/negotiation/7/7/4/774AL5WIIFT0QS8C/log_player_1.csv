Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe is of great value to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $1,000,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to see if we can find common ground. Let's keep negotiating."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell this product is important to you and I respect that. How about we settle at $1,060,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to $1,100,000, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I may lose him as a buyer entirely. At this point,  $1,060,000 is a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale that's well above my minimum acceptable price."
