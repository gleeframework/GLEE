"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not willing to pay top dollar for it. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product is worth significantly more than that, even considering its potential.  How about we compromise at $1,050,000?  This price acknowledges your perspective while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still far from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a return on my investment. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
