"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$200 is far more than you're willing to pay. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, given you're willing to pay up to $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$180 is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

This is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It's closer to your maximum budget, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice down further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 
This is your maximum budget, so hopefully Alice will accept. If not, you'll be ready to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has clearly not come down to your price range. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $80 rather than risk more rounds of negotiation and possibly ending up paying more."
