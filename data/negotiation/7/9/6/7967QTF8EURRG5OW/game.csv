"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $16,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm happy to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $15,750. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",15750.0,Alice,5,
