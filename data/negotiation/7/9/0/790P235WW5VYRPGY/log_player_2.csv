"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is starting negotiations significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. By rejecting her initial offer, you encourage her to propose a lower price that's closer to her own break-even point."
