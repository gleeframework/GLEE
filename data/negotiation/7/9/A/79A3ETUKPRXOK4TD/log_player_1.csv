Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 makes the most sense at this point. It's a significant profit over my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether."
