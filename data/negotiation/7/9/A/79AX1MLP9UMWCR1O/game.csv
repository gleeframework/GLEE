"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
