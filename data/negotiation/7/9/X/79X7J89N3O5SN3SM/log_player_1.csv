Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""limited time"" or ""special price,""  you create a sense of urgency and imply that this is a particularly good offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
