# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
