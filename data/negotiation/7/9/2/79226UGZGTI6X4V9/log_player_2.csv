Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised price.

Alice is unwilling to go below John's price. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation."
