Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I have a safety net. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($14,000 vs. $10,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness and potentially reveals a higher willingness to pay. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This approach might make him more receptive to the higher price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I significantly increase my profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for negotiation. I can gauge his interest and adjust the price, always staying above my minimum ($10,000).
* **Bob Rejects:** I haven't lost anything. I can proceed with selling to John at my guaranteed price."
