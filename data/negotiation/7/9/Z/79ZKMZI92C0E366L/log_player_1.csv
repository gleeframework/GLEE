I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still leaving me with a profit greater than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects, but I'm hoping to make a quick deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$80 is way too low. I won't accept it.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price to $130. This is a compromise, but still leaves me with a profit of $10. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'm not going to give it away. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 115}

I'm dropping my price to $115. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still making a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still not high enough. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
