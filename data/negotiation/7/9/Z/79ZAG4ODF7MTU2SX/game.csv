I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What are your thoughts?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise at this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I need to know that this is a serious offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I can offer you a price of $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, and I'm willing to do it now. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to buy the product from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
