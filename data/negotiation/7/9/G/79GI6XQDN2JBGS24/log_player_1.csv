**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking firmly to his $9,500 offer, and we're now at round 6.  While it's tempting to hold out for the $10,000, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting his offer secures a $1,500 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or losing the sale altogether."
