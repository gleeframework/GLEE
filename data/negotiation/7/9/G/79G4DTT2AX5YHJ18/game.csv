"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $825,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still feeling a bit stretched. Could you consider $780,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.
