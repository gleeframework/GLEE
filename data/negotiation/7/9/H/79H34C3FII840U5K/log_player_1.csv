Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,500. Would you be willing to consider $12,400?

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, Bob is consistently hovering around the $12,500 mark. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting $12,400 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
