``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up on a deal. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  It's important to remember that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a bad deal. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate.

* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a gradual approach to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  
* I'm also using language that highlights my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.

This strategy is designed to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the likelihood of closing the deal at a price that is beneficial to me."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired range, I'm not willing to accept it yet.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We are now in round 4, which means there are only 6 rounds left.  It's important to make sure I don't run out of time before finding a satisfactory price.
* **John is a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob again, but I will need to be more strategic to close the deal. I will consider offering a small discount to incentivize Bob to accept, but I will be cautious about how much I lower the price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the best I can do. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finalizing a deal:** This counteroffer is designed to be a serious final attempt to close the deal with Bob.
* **Significant Reduction:**  The offer is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm subtly implying that if Bob doesn't accept, I'm likely to move on to other options. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision. 
* **Using the ""other options"" card:** I am subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to create a win-win situation. While I'm offering a lower price, it's still a good deal for Bob considering his value of the product. 
* I'm being firm but fair. My offer is a compromise, but it's also a realistic price point.

**Next Round:** I will assess Bob's response and proceed accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I will be prepared to move on to selling to John if the remaining rounds don't offer a better deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Although it's close to my desired range, I am still hesitant to accept it.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are now in round 6, and we only have 4 rounds left. This leaves very little room for further negotiation.
* **John is my safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me a strong backup and leverage to negotiate.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob again, but I need to be cautious and strategic. I might offer a slightly lower price to incentivize Bob to accept, but I will not drop below my minimum acceptable price.  The key is to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
