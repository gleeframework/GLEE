Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $9,500 is too low for me, especially since I know John is willing to pay $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us some room to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject the offer. John is willing to pay $10,000, and I'm hoping to get a bit closer to that number."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable dropping below $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's only $100 away from my minimum, I still think I can get a bit closer to $10,000.  John is a safe option, and I'm going to try to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We're getting close with Bob, but I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so that's the best option for me right now."
