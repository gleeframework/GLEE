{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel like it's a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,250. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is now at my minimum.  Further negotiation might not yield a better result, and I risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum."
