"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price ($9,000) knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I have 8 rounds left to potentially close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with a price of $8,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and suggesting a meeting in the middle to further encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $8,000.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal. I've successfully negotiated a fair price for myself, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
