Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $1,200,000 is significantly more than your floor of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still room for you to potentially increase the price if he's willing to pay more. 
* **It's a fair offer:**  $1,200,000 gives Bob a good deal, and you still get a very profitable sale.

By offering $1,200,000, you maximize your potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you have your fallback option of selling to John for $800,000."
