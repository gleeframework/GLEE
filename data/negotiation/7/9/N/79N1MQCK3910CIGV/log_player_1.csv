Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $80 and below his estimated value of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum of $80 and is a good compromise. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
