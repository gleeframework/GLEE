"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a good offer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $132? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $132 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $136? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings",136.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but I'm still not comfortable with $136. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132 and $136, so how about we meet at $134? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase if we can agree on this price.",134.0,Bob,6,
