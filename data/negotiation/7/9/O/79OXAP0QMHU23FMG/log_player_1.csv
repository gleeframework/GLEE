{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter his offer or move on to John if it doesn't seem like a worthwhile negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
