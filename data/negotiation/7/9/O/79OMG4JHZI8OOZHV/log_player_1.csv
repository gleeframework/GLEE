Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it's still a profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing the $200,000 potential gain for him. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects, it signals he might not be serious about buying or is aiming for a much lower price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob isn't willing to negotiate.

I'll then adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have a guaranteed buyer in John.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Potentially increase the offer:** I can counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:** If Bob continues to lowball, it reinforces the idea that he's not serious about a deal.

I will use the next round to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit margin for me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but reiterating my own value and costs.  I'm also aiming to build a sense of compromise and willingness to work towards a deal.

This approach allows me to:

* **Test Bob's willingness:** If he accepts, I achieve a good outcome.
* **Signal my limits:** If he rejects, it gives me more information about his bottom line and helps me determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I still have the security of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This offer is fair, considering both our needs.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While it's still a significant discount, it's a good deal considering:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting the offer, I can still try to negotiate a small bonus or additional terms in the future, depending on the final agreement.
* **Time savings:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and I have a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Avoiding the risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he might walk away altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a profitable sale and avoiding unnecessary delays or potential losses."
