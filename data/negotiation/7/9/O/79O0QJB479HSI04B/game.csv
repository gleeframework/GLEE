"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000, which still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value.  Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
