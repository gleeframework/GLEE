"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $975,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $890,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
