"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **It signals that I value the product highly:** This might encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **I have the backup option of selling to John:**  If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** for now. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob while still ensuring a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** of $1,200,000.  

While I initially wanted a higher price, Bob has been firm on his counteroffer, and we're nearing the middle of our negotiation rounds.  It's important to consider:

* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I risk losing out on a sale if I continue to negotiate.
* **The backup option is still there:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through.

Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and allows me to move on."
