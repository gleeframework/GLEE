"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's far below what I need to make this deal work. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept a price that undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $1250000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's true value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's features and potential benefits, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $800000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1000000.  This offer reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
