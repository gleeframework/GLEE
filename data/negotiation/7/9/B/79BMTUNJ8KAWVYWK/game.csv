"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This price still gives me some room to cover my costs, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? That's the best I can do for now.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $95 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $98?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I won't be able to get a good deal from you. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at $96, I'll consider it a fair deal.",96.0,Bob,6,
