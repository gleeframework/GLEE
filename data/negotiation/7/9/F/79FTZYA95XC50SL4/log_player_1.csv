"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and selling to John would provide a much better outcome.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $800000. I'm willing to go up to $820000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $820,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with that amount. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob first."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can go up to $810000. That's the absolute maximum I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $810,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price and I'm not convinced Bob will go any higher.  I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
