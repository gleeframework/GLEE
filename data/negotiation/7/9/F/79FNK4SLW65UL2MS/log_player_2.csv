"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is lower than her value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You'll try to get a better deal from Alice."
