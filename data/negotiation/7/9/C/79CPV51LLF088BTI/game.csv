"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it, reflecting a fair market value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'd like to propose a price of $1,575,000. This would ensure both of us are comfortable with the deal. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,575,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $1,525,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
