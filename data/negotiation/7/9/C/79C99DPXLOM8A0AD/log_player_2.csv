Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000, but I need to be firm on this price. No lower

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm at $975,000 and is unlikely to go lower.  At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John for $1,000,000. While we could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll drop further, and we risk her withdrawing the offer entirely.  John provides a guaranteed price that keeps us under our $1,000,000 limit."
