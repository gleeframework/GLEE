,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could we meet halfway at $15,000? This feels like a fair price considering its worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
