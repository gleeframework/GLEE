Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could we meet halfway at $15,000? This feels like a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is getting quite close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $12,000 ensures a good profit without jeopardizing the sale.
