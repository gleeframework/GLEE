Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $930,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this product and allows us both to walk away happy."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $920,000 is my maximum offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $920,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $920,000 is a strong outcome. It provides a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation rounds."
