Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It's also likely to be appealing to Bob, as it's lower than the $12,000 it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to make more than $10,000 to make this worthwhile. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay that price for it, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he's trying to compromise. While I could keep negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a higher price from him. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
