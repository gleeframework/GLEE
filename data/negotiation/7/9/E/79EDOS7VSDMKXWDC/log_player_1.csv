Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $150 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to me, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation, showing I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:** I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value while still keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, hopefully reaching a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. However, I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully craft a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground while keeping the potential deal with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $100 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, promoting a sense of collaboration and fairness.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The phrase ""Let's find a middle ground"" subtly implies that I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm also hinting at the possibility of moving on to other buyers if we can't reach an agreement quickly. 

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the possibility of a deal with John as a safety net.  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
