"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me though. I'd be willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart. I can do $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value this product can bring to your business. Let's try this â€“ I can go down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and a very strong offer considering its potential for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering the significant long-term benefits this product will bring to your business, would $1,400,000 be possible? This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
