"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you.  I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'd like to propose an initial offer of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,000,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it frames the subsequent discussions around a higher price range.
* **Signaling Value:** A high initial offer can signal that you believe strongly in the product's worth, potentially making Bob more willing to negotiate towards a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me though. I'd be willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and the product's value to him ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's early in the negotiation, and you have room to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  You're making a concession from your initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the concession is relatively small ($200,000), showing you're still aiming for a high price.
* **Justification:**  You're reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing why your offer is reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** You are still significantly above Bob's offer, but also significantly above your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation while discouraging extremely low counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart. I can do $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is increasing his offers, but at a very slow pace. This suggests he has room to move significantly higher.
* **Below Value:**  His offer is still substantially below his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000). There's no pressure to accept a price significantly lower than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value this product can bring to your business. Let's try this â€“ I can go down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and a very strong offer considering its potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Justification:** You're making a more substantial drop in price ($200,000) to signal flexibility and a desire to close the deal. However, you are clearly stating it is a significant compromise and tying it back to the value it offers Bob specifically.
* **Above Minimum, Approaching Midpoint:** This offer keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price but moves closer to a potential midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's first counteroffer. 
* **Urgency and Value Focus:** The language (""Let's try this"") creates a sense of urgency and opportunity.  You are again emphasizing the value proposition to Bob, hoping to move him closer to his $1,000,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealed Information:** Bob has now explicitly stated his top price is $1,000,000. This is valuable information.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While he's revealed his upper limit, he's still offering above it, indicating a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Time Advantage:**  You still have several rounds, and the pace of his increases suggests he may be willing to move closer to your range.  

**Next Steps:** Your next counteroffer should aim to bring the price closer to the $1,200,000 - $1,300,000 range, but you need to do so carefully, acknowledging his limit while highlighting the value he'd be missing out on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering the significant long-term benefits this product will bring to your business, would $1,400,000 be possible? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring and Concession:** You're making a smaller concession this time ($200,000) to anchor the price higher than his $1,100,000 offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are nearing your limit. 
* **Finality and Urgency:** Stating ""this is my final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Value Focus:** You are continuing to reiterate the long-term value proposition, hoping to justify the price even though it's slightly above his stated budget.
* **Safety Net:** You are still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price and have John's offer as a backup if Bob rejects this offer."
