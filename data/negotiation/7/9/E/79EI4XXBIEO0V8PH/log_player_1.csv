I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $10,000. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it's appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not convinced I can't do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}

I'm going to counter with $13,750. This is a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still below my initial price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and that Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price. I'd rather take the guaranteed $10,000 than risk getting stuck with an even lower price."
