"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $20000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be happy to offer $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $18000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at a lower price. I can do $16000 for the product. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your effort to come down in price.  $16000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $14000? I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on that.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at an even lower price. I can do $15500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15250.  If you can meet me at that price, we can close the deal now.",15250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me at $15250, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I can do $15500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about other options. If we can't meet in the middle, I may have to explore other opportunities. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,9,
