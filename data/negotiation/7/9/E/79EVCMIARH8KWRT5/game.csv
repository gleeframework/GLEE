"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  My starting price is $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a bit too high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $8,000? I feel that's a fair offer, considering the value I place on it.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about meeting in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. ",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving towards a middle ground.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $9,000 is under what I hoped for, I understand your position. To be done with this negotiation, I'd accept $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
