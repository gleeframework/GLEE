"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a slight premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us and we can close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell at that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping it'll be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
