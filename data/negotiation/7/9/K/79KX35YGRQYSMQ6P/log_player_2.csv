"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is higher than my goal price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening.  This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell the product to you for $110.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, but it's still above my target. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm sticking to my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100 yet, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but very slowly. I'll press for a better deal one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $105 is my final offer. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with a different seller."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

This counter-offer puts me slightly above my target price, but well below Alice's last offer.  The ""final offer"" statement adds some pressure, and mentioning the other seller reminds Alice I have alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a good deal so far, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm at $110, and I'm not willing to go higher than $105. John's offer of $150 is less appealing now, but it's better to cut my losses and move on at this point."
