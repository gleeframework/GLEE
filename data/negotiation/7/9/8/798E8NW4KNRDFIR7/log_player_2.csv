Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, we're getting close to John's price. It's worth one more try to see if Alice will go lower, otherwise, we'll buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make a final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is my last concession. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,750. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000.  While we could try to haggle Alice down further, the potential savings are minimal and outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge and we'll end up paying even more than John's price."
