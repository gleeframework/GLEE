"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I have a good starting point. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to make Bob feel comfortable and encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to negotiation, which might make him more likely to counteroffer instead of simply rejecting my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aiming Higher:** While $9,000 is a good offer and is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Not Rushing to Sell:** Selling to John for $8,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price.
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:** The message continues to be polite and friendly, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Original Asking Price:** By mentioning my original asking price, I subtly remind Bob that I'm not desperate to sell for significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your original price, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. There's still room for negotiation, especially since I'm not in a rush to sell to John. 
* **Strategic Play:**  I'll reject the offer and counteroffer again to see if I can push Bob a little further. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to come up a little more. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm weighing the risk of getting a lower price against the possibility of getting closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! While I'm happy with $8,500, I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price, and we can both be happy with the outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing $9,000, which is higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous counter-offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This subtly emphasizes that I'm not just looking for a quick sale but a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and positive tone, making Bob feel less pressured and more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. How about $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $8,750 is getting close to my minimum value, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. Bob has shown continued interest, and there's still a chance he might come up slightly. 
* **Strategic Play:** I'm choosing to reject the offer and counteroffer again. This keeps the negotiation alive and gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a better price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential reward of getting a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-conscious, and I appreciate your continued interest. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price that's within our both ranges.  Let me know if you're willing to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing $8,900, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a decrease from my previous one. This shows I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair price"" to highlight that it benefits both of us. This encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time is Running Out:** I'm using a bit of pressure by suggesting a middle ground, hinting that we're getting closer to a final decision.  This could make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $8600?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is of the Essence:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  However, I'm getting close to my minimum value.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm weighing the risk of Bob backing out with the potential reward of reaching a price closer to my desired range.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,600 is only $400 above my minimum, I'm willing to risk one more round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** With only one round remaining, I'm making a final attempt to get a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing $8,700, which is exactly halfway between our last two offers. This emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by stating that this is a ""final agreement"" attempt. This could encourage Bob to reconsider and accept the offer.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm taking a risk by going down to $8,700, but I'm hoping Bob will realize this is a good deal for him and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Up:**  This is the final round. If I reject Bob's offer, I'll have to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Minimum Value:** While $8,500 is my minimum, I've already made concessions and am likely not going to get a better offer.  
* **Avoiding Loss:**  It's better to accept Bob's offer than risk losing the sale and getting only $8,000 from John."
