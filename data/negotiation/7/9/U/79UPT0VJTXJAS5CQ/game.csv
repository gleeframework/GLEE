"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise at $14,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
