"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My asking price is $1,400,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify the full $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $1,350,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't work for me. This product is worth a lot more to both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,287,500. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to close this deal quickly.  Let's be reasonable and make this happen.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,275,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and meet you at $1,280,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
