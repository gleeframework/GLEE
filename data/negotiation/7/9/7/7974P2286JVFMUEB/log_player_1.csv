"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My asking price is $1,400,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's within my minimum acceptable range, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to secure a higher price than my floor of $1,500,000.
* **Framing the Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to highlight the potential gain he'll receive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for negotiation by inviting Bob to discuss the offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify the full $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.** While I want to close the deal, $1,300,000 is still below my floor of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. His counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **Jhon as a safety net:** Having Jhon as an option keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more attractive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value and fairness:**  I'm again emphasizing the value the product offers Bob and presenting my counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** The message emphasizes the goal of working together to finalize the deal,  creating a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $1,350,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise. There's still potential for a higher offer from him.
* **Jhon is a secure backup:** Selling to Jhon guarantees me my minimum price, but I want to explore if I can get more from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,350,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,250,000. This shows I'm genuinely trying to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair solution that benefits both of us, aiming to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept, as he may be worried about losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, but I believe there's still potential to get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Jhon as a backup:** Selling to Jhon guarantees me my minimum price, but I want to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob.  There's no harm in seeing what his final counteroffer is, but I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't work for me. This product is worth a lot more to both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,287,500. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to close this deal quickly.  Let's be reasonable and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1287500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,275,000. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting Mutual Value:**  I emphasize that the product is worth more to both of us, reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Urgency and Reasonableness:**  I'm urging a quick decision, suggesting that this offer is fair and reasonable. This adds pressure and might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,275,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and meet you at $1,280,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 8, and only two rounds remain.
* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Jhon is a Secure Option:**  Selling to Jhon guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money. 

At this point, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob outweighs the potential of squeezing out a few extra dollars. Selling to Jhon guarantees a profitable outcome."
