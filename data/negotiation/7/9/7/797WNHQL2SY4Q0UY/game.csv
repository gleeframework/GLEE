"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would give us both a fair deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $95. It's simply not a fair deal for me at this point. If you're truly interested, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to budge further.",95.0,Alice,5,
