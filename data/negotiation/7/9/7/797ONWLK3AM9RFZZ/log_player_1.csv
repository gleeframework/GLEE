{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and leaves a potential profit margin. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone can help Bob feel more comfortable engaging with the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll counter with a lower price, still keeping it above my minimum.
* I'll keep a close eye on the negotiation. If it seems like it's dragging on or Bob isn't serious about buying, I'll stop the negotiation and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also protecting my profit margin.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob seems unwilling to budge, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can come down a bit further, but $90 is just too low for me. Would you consider $110?  It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to come up in his offer.
* **Maintain friendly tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly can help keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider my next move.  If he continues to lowball, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I can afford to be a bit more stubborn.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make another counteroffer,  perhaps $115, to see if I can get Bob closer to my target.
* **Monitor the situation:**  If Bob continues to be obstinate, I'll  likely accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $100 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $115?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** This offer is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlight the fairness:** Emphasizing the ""fair price"" for both parties encourages Bob to see it as a win-win.
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""gets us closer to a deal"" creates a sense of momentum and encourages Bob to agree. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob. 
* However, I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $115. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  This negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. It seems like we're at an impasse. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is more than my minimum and significantly more than what Bob is currently offering.

**Strategy:**

* **Cut Losses:** While I would ideally like to sell to Bob, the back-and-forth has become unproductive. It's time to secure a profitable sale and move on.
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting John's offer guarantees me the best outcome at this point in the negotiation."
