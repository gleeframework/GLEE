"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can come down a bit further, but $90 is just too low for me. Would you consider $110?  It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $100 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $115?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
