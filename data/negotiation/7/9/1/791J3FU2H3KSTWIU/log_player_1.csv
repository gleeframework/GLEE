Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both Bob's value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to justify the high price without explicitly revealing my minimum or Bob's potential maximum.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning John as a backup buyer could be risky. It might make Bob feel less pressured to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in potential negotiations."
