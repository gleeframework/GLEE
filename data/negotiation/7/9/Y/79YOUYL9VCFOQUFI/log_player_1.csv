Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500.  While I was hoping for a bit more, this is a good deal for me, and it's much better than selling to John for $10,000."
