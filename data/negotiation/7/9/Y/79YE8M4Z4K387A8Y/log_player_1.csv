Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for a price of $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might accept, which is slightly below his perceived value ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to feel like he got a deal. 
* **Secure the Higher Sale:** It's better to start high and potentially negotiate down than to start low and risk leaving money on the table. If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John."
