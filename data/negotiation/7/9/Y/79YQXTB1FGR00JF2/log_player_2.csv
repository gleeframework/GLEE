"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me at $950,000. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  My goal is to buy the product for significantly less than John's $1,000,000 offer. Starting at $650,000 gives us a good chance to settle somewhere in the $700,000 - $800,000 range, which would be a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a significant amount from her initial offer, but it's still above my target range.  I'll reject and offer a price closer to her value of $800,000, hoping she's getting more flexible as we get deeper into the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate seriously. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $750,000 is a strong position â€“ it's a significant jump from my previous offer, but still gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary while staying well below John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Offering a price closer to her likely value might encourage her to close the deal sooner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd be happy with, we're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I'm willing to bet she'll be more flexible in the later rounds as the pressure to make a deal increases. Even a small concession from $812,500 would be a significant saving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair offer, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's slightly below the midpoint between our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below $800,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By phrasing the offer as a way to ""settle"" and ""walk away happy,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage Alice to accept a price close to her bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While $780,000 is a good price, I'm leaving a little room to negotiate up slightly if necessary in the remaining rounds."
