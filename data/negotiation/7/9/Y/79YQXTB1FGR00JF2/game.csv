"Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me at $950,000. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen!",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair offer, and we can both walk away happy.",780000.0,Bob,6,
