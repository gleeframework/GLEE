Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me at $950,000. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer from Bob is too low.  I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair offer, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below my desired price. However, with only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely we will reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safer option, guaranteeing a respectable profit and avoiding potential further negotiations that could lead to a lower price."
