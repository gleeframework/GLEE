"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,080,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,115,000?",1115000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,115,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
