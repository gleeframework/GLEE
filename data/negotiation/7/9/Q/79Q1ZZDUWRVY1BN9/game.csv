"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and still leaves me with a comfortable profit. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to compromise, $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10250.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering your estimated value of $12000, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10250, which would be $9875. Can we meet at that price?",9875.0,Bob,4,
