"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
