"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Since you have a backup option (buying from John), you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

**Next steps:**  You'll make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get the price closer to your maximum value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. This product is definitely interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  The message highlights the product's value while emphasizing your price constraint.
* **Leaving space:**  By suggesting $8,500, you leave room for Alice to counter with a higher price (closer to her value) before you move to your backup option (John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum value of $10,000.  You're not willing to pay more than $8,500 at this point.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Alice has shown flexibility, and it's worth exploring if you can negotiate further.

**Next steps:** You'll need to counter with a lower offer again, aiming to find a price point that is acceptable to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,750. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($8,500) and Alice's latest offer ($9,200).
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes that this is your maximum price, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining interest:**  The message still expresses interest in the product, making Alice feel like a deal is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than $8,750, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,200. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is not likely to yield a better price:** It's unlikely that Alice will lower her price further to your target range, especially since she's already been flexible.
* **Saving time and effort:**  You've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's starting to take time. 

**Next steps:**  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's more efficient to buy from John now and avoid further negotiation."
