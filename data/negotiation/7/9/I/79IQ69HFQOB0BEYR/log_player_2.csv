"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is still within your budget. 
* However, you can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* This strategy allows you to potentially get the product for a price closer to Alice's $80 value, saving you more money."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $95. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $105, which is still within your budget of $120. 
* You have already rejected a lower offer of $95, and there is a risk of Alice getting frustrated and rejecting future counteroffers.
* Accepting the offer at $105 secures the product while saving you $15 compared to buying from John."
