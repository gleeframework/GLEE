"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value for it. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $95. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
