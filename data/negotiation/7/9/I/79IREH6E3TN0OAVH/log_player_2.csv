Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it gives us both room to compromise. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,750 is a good compromise. It's lower than my initial goal, but still a reasonable price considering the value of the product. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and save money compared to buying from John."
