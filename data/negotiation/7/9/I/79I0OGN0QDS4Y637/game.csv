"Alice, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1500000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1200000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
