"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $160? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160. How about $145? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $145. How about we split the difference and go with $152.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $152.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $152.50. How about $148.75? It's a fair price that I'm willing to pay.",148.75,Bob,6,
