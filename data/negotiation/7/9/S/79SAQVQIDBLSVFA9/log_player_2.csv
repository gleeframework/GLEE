Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly hovering above our maximum budget of $12,000. She seems unwilling to budge significantly from her last offer. It's highly likely we won't get a better deal from her than John's offer of $12,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
