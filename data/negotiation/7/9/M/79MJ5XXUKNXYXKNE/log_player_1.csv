"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation.
* **Reasonable Margin:** $12,000 still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $9,000 is still significantly less than the minimum $15,000 Alice values the product at. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate, there's still room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it's best to explore if a better price can be reached with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, making my offer more attractive.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $10,500 is a price point that allows for further negotiation if necessary, but still provides a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** While $9,800 is closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what she's aiming for.
* **Negotiation Room:** Alice can still attempt to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has indicated this is his maximum offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, Alice should continue to explore if a better price can be reached with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,800 is still quite a bit below what I need.  How about $10,200?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would still be a great deal for you given the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a price closer to my minimum while still showing willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price only slightly to show flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value Bob places on the product to make my offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $9,500 is still significantly less than Alice's minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Although Bob is getting closer to Alice's minimum, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, Alice should continue to explore if a better price can be reached with Bob before resorting to John. It's still worth trying to get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think it's still a great value for you given the benefits of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price above $9,500.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the value Bob places on the product to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Final Offer:** This could be considered my ""final offer"" before considering selling to John, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $9,200 is still significantly less than Alice's minimum value of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation:** With only two rounds remaining, there's limited time to negotiate further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees Alice a significant profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob for a potentially lower price carries the risk of not reaching a deal and missing out on a guaranteed sale to John.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Alice to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk a potentially lower price with Bob."
