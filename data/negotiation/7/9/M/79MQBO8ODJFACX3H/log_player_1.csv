Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she has a strong position and shouldn't settle for anything less."
