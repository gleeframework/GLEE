"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1700000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.
