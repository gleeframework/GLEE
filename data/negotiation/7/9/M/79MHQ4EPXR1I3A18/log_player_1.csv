Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" aims to increase the perceived value in Bob's mind. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It signals that you value the product highly, but are potentially open to discussion. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you're in a strong position. You can then negotiate down, knowing you have a secure offer from John."
