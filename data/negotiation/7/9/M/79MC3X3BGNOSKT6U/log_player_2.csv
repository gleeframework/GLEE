While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price of $12,000.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal. I believe I can still get a price that works for me without resorting to buying from John."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the closest she's come to my ideal price of $12,000, it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying. With only a few rounds left, I don't think I can get her down further, and I'm not willing to pay more than my budget.  I'm going to take the guaranteed deal with John at $12,000 to avoid any further risk of going over my budget."
