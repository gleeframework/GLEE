I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I think $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm starting to run out of time. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum."
