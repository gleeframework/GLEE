Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than to you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know John exists or your minimum price. Your advantage is in this hidden information.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation than yours.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition""  add perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While a high price, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your guaranteed $800,000.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the best price, maintaining a positive tone can be beneficial for future interactions, even if Bob declines this offer."
