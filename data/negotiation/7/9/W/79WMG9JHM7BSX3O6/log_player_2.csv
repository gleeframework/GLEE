"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
This product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and $1,200,000 to Bob. Alice offered a price of $900,000, which is a good starting point, but we can definitely do better. It is worth negotiating to see if a better deal can be reached before buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $1,050,000 is a good deal, especially compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer saves me $150,000."
