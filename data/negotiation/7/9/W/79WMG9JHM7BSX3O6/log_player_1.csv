Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant value for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers.
