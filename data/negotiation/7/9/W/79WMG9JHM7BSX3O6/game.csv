"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant value for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
