"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000 for this product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $925,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but $925,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $975,000? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making me work for this! I'm willing to go up slightly, but $975,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much further. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $970,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal, though!",970000.0,Alice,7,
