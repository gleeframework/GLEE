Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While your initial offer is your ideal price, starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A high initial offer also helps you understand how interested Bob is. If he immediately rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive."
