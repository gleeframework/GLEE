"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This strategy:

* **Tests Alice's flexibility:** It gauges how willing Alice is to negotiate and move from her initial price. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to increase our bid gradually over the remaining rounds.
* **Aims for a good deal:** Our goal is to buy the product for a price significantly lower than our $100 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Alice rejected our lowball offer, she's showing a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly closer to our range. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** We still have plenty of rounds left. By continuing to negotiate, we might be able to get the price down even further, closer to her $80 valuation. 
* **John as a backup:**  We always have the option of buying from John for $100 if the negotiations don't go our way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit low.  How about we split the difference and do $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Alice met us in the middle, so we're reciprocating by moving directly to what we believe is her value for the product ($80). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer reveals whether Alice is truly willing to sell at her perceived value.
* **Maintaining Position:** If she rejects this, we know we'll likely need to go higher, but we've established a firm position."
