I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing some willingness to compromise.  I hope he sees this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and while I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll keep going back and forth and ultimately not reach an agreement.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to sell to John."
