"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's talk about a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
