"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $750,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $800,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $750,000.  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price.  $800,000 is a good compromise and saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John."
