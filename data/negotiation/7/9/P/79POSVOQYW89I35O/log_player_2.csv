"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($120) is lower than your maximum budget of $150.**  
* **You will save $30 compared to buying from John.**

While you could try to negotiate with Alice, the offer is already within your budget and saves you money. It's a good deal."
