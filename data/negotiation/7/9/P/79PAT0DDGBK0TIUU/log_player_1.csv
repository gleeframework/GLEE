Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I start with my desired price of $100. I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I make it clear I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price. This encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings. I can then gradually adjust the price based on Bob's counteroffers and my willingness to sell to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $90, which is still a decent price, but I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **Strategy:** I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more before accepting. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, potentially landing somewhere between $90 and my initial $100.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $100 gives me more leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'd be willing to sell it for $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground.  The $95 price is still higher than what Bob offered, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. This can hopefully lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Strategy:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm continuing the negotiation process and testing Bob's limits.  I'm also keeping John's $100 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Persistence:**  Bob has stuck to his offer of $90. 
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  While I initially aimed for a higher price, it seems Bob is firm on his offer.  There's a good chance he won't budge further.
* **Value vs. Time:**  It's important to consider the potential time lost by continuing to negotiate.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely or me needing to sell to John.  
* **John as a Backup:**  Since I have John as a backup buyer for $100,  accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent price."
