Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $1,200,000. How about $1,290,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000

``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob is consistently moving upwards, and we're reaching a point of diminishing returns. Accepting at $1,290,000 secures a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
