"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is far below the product's true value. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $13,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $12,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and it brings us closer to a final agreement. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  We've both made compromises, and I'm willing to go a little further. How about we settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us and brings us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",12000.0,Alice,7,
