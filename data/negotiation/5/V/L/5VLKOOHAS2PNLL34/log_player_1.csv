Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still exceeding your guaranteed sale to John. Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Language:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as a potential win for Bob.
* **No Ultimatums:**  Avoid language that might make Bob defensive. Keep the tone open for discussion.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but above $1,500,000). 
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a smaller profit margin to secure the deal.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust the price if he counters."
