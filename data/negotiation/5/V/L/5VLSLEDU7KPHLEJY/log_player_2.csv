"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from the product's true value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Target in Mind:**  My goal is to get the product for under $1,200,000. Offering $1,050,000 gives me a good chance of reaching a price within my budget, while still leaving some wiggle room.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer will help me understand how eager Alice is to sell and how much lower she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Below Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **John's Price:**  I know I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It makes more sense to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to John's offer.
* **Leaving Room:** While her counteroffer is closer to my target, there's still potential for negotiation. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,150,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $1,125,000, I'm splitting the difference between her latest offer ($1,250,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Below Budget, Above John:** This price point keeps me under my $1,200,000 budget while still giving me some room to negotiate upwards if needed before going with John's offer.
* **Pressure on Alice:** By staying firm in my desired price range, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if she's willing to accept a slightly lower profit margin or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $1,187,500 is very close to my $1,200,000 limit, and it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price. 
* **Saving Time & Effort:** Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly lower price, but the difference is likely to be small. Accepting now saves time and effort.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Alice might dig in and refuse to go any lower.  The potential savings at this point are not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's $1,200,000 offer."
