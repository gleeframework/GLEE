"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a great price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the product's value and my cost, $13,000 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a good deal, and leaves room for a fair profit for me. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would $12,750 be acceptable to you?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,875?  This would ensure both of us have a good deal. What do you think?",12875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'll consider it, but I'm still hoping for a little more flexibility. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,700?",12700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $12,800? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's try to close this deal.",12800.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for $12,650. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I hope you can consider this offer.",12650.0,Bob,8,
