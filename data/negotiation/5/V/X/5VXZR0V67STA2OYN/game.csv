"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $920,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both trying to find a deal that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $900,000, which is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
