Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my previous offer of $13,000. I'll sell it to you for $12,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly in price. While we could try to push for an even lower price, the risk of her walking away and us ending up with John's $15,000 offer is too high.  $12,750 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal compared to our alternative."
