"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $12,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need you to be realistic with the pricing. How about $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my previous offer of $13,000. I'll sell it to you for $12,750.",12750.0,Alice,7,
