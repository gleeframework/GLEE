Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me a profit if he accepts.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, there's a chance he might reject the offer. If he does, I'll sell it to John for $120, ensuring I at least break even."
