{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob to entice him, while also establishing a clear price point.

**Strategy:**

This offer leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't start too low. I can then adjust based on Bob's response, but I have the option to go to John if the negotiations stall or get too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can't afford to spend more than $8,000 on this product. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed to the next round because there's still potential for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth to me. To be fair, I can offer it to you for $10,000.  This is still a good price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that is still above Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the value of the product. I also use language like ""meet me halfway"" to encourage him to consider my counter offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground with Bob without selling too low. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and increases the likelihood of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still unable to meet at $10,000. Could you possibly reconsider and come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* Given the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Bob, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.

**Strategy:**

While $9,000 is less than I ideally wanted, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or a complete loss of the deal. It's important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks in a negotiation."
