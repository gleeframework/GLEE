Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $14,000 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000. I'll try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
