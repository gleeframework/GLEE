"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $14,000 right now. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
