"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for on the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for on the market. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is my maximum budget.  Accepting this offer means I get the product for the price I'm willing to pay without needing to negotiate further.  Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no benefit to switching sellers."
