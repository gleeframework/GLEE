"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to accept or counteroffer.
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  By starting high, you leave room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your desired value.** While it's more than John's offer, you're still aiming for a higher price.
* **You have room to negotiate.** There are still 8 rounds remaining, and you can likely secure a better price through counteroffers. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option.**  While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer, you have a guaranteed alternative if negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer is halfway between your initial offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This signals a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're not dropping your price drastically, demonstrating that you still value the product highly. This encourages Bob to consider accepting or making a more competitive counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he accepts, you've secured a good price. If he rejects, you can adjust your strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and the number of negotiation rounds is shrinking.  
* **No Improvement Expected:** Bob's offer hasn't changed from round 2. It's unlikely he'll offer more in the next round.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $500 over John's offer, which is a worthwhile gain.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If we reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, we risk Bob becoming less interested or walking away entirely. 

This decision maximizes immediate profit while acknowledging the limited negotiating time and the potential risks of further negotiation."
