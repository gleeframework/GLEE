"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, I believe your starting price is a little high.  I would be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is getting close, but I think we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $815,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,
