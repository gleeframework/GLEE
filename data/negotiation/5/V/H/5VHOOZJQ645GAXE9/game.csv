"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe we can both live with.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already below my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
