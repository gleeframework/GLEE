Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for $120.  Accepting his offer at this point seems like the best move."
