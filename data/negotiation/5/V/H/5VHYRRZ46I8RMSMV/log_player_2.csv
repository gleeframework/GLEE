"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $9,500.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $9,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is very close to your counteroffer of $8,500. It's worth accepting this offer to save $1,250 compared to buying from John.  You're still getting a good deal as you value the product at $10,000."
