"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher to $860,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",860000.0,Alice,5,
