"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

Thanks for the offer Alice!  $9000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment. Would you consider $7000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.,7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $8200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $7500. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $8100. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $8100 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's try $7800 as a final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize this deal.",7800.0,Bob,6,
