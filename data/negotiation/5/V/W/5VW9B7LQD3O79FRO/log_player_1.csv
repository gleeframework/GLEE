"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price while still keeping in mind the potential offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and it'll ensure we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $92.5 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to go below $95. I'll counter with my previous offer and hope for a deal this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still the lowest I can go at this point. It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you at $88, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is much more appealing at this point. It's time to move on and close the deal with John."
