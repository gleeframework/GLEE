"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is extremely valuable to me, and I believe it could be of great value to your business as well. I'm asking for $2000000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather work with you if possible. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
