"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $1,550,000? This is a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,680,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
