Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit short of my target.
