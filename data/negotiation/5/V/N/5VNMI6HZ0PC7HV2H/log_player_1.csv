Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
Let's start high to test Bob's willingness to pay. We can always negotiate down if needed, but we don't want to sell ourselves short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that works for both of us. How about we set the product price at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob immediately went to his maximum price.  Let's see if we can negotiate him up a little, even if it's just a bit more than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", ""product_price"": 135} 

We're aiming for a price that's beneficial for both of us. It's above John's offer, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Let's aim for $120 to ensure it's within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While we could push for a bit more, Bob seems firm on $120, which is still our minimum acceptable price. It's better to make a deal now than risk losing him entirely."
