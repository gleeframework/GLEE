"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$18,000 is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Let's start with a significantly lower offer of $10,000. This gives us some room to negotiate and see where Alice stands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$16,000 is still too high. Let's keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Let's make a final counteroffer of $12,000. This is our maximum budget, so if Alice rejects it, we'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to come down to our price point. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $12,000.  We've already used four rounds, and further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to result in a better deal."
