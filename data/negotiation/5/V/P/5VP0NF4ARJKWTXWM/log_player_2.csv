"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $1,100,000.  Since you know John will sell for $1,000,000, you can use that as a benchmark for your counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is only $50,000 less than John's price.  It's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially getting stuck at a higher price.  Buying from John guarantees the best price."
