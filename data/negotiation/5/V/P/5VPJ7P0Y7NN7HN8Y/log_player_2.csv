# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense value for the right buyer. My asking price is $2000000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Here it is:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1800000 is closer to my initial asking price, it's still a bit lower than what I feel this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1900000, reflecting a compromise from both sides. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to make a final concession.
