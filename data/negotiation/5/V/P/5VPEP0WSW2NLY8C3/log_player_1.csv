Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe a price of $10,000 reflects its true value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** By stating that the offered price reflects the ""true value,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth even more on the open market. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open for discussion. If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate down towards $8,000.

While we have a backup buyer, it's better to secure the best possible price with Bob first."
