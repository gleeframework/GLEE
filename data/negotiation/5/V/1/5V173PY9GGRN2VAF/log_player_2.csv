"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and the risk of losing the product to another buyer is high."
