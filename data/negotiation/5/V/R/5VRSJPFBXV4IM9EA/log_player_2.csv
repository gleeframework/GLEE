# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now small enough that it's worth taking the guaranteed deal from John."
