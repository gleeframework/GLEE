Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $925,000 still represents a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have some indication that Bob highly values the product. If you have no information about his perceived value, you might offer a slightly lower price to increase the chances of acceptance."
