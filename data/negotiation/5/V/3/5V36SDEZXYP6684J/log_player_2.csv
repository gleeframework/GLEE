Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

Let's start with a lower price of $300,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice is getting closer to my initial offer, but $475,000 is still more than I want to pay. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to go lower than $500,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. It's time to move on and buy the product from John. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
