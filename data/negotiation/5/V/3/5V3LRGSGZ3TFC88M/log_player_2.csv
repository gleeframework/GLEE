{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $9,800.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"

Round 7

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  At this point, Alice is not willing to go lower than $10,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to get the product from John for a lower price and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
