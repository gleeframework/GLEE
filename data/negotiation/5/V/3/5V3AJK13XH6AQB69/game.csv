"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'll accept $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and still significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
