{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to counter, but I also have John as a backup buyer if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,500, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
