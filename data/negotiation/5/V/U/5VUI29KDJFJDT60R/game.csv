"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,125,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet at $1,200,000?  This price would still give you a significant return on your investment. It's also the lowest I can go without taking a major loss.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
