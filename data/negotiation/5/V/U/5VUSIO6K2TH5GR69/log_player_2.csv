{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $800,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than my budget, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get a lower price from Alice.  It's time to buy from John for $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and get the product."
