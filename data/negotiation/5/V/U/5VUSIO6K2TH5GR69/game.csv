"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
