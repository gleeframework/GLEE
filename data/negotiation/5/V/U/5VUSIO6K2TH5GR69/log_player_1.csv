"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to see if he's genuinely interested and to gauge his negotiating style.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal.

**Important Note:** I am keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. I will assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, but still recognizing that I need to make some concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $975,000, which is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while keeping my goal of earning as much as possible in mind.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm using the ""split the difference"" strategy, which is often perceived as fair and can help reach a compromise faster. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm carefully observing Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to assess how close I am to my target price and whether selling to John is a better option. However, I'm confident that this counteroffer is a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there.  I'm not willing to settle just yet because I believe I can still push for a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my target while acknowledging that I need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $950,000, which is a further concession but still above Bob's last offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while trying to maximize my profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise and making it clear that this is my final offer. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm hopeful that this final offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
