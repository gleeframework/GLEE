"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to your maximum budget than to her own valuation. You should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved down in price, it's not a significant concession. You should continue negotiating to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to see some more flexibility on the price to make this work for me. How about $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is suggesting a ""meeting halfway"" approach, but this isn't truly halfway based on your initial offers.  You're still closer to your maximum budget. You can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and call it a deal at $1,212,500?"",
""product_price"": 1212500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Specific Calculation:** By suggesting splitting the difference (between $1,250,000 and $1,175,000), you demonstrate a logical approach to finding common ground. 
* **Pressure:**  You're getting closer to your walk-away point ($1,500,000 with John).  Putting a little more pressure might push Alice to close the deal."
