"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to see some more flexibility on the price to make this work for me. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and call it a deal at $1,212,500?",1212500.0,Bob,6,
