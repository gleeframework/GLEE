"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending an exclusive offer to purchase it for $9,500. This price not only ensures a fair return on my investment but also provides you with significant savings compared to the market value of $10,000. I trust this proposal aligns well with your budget and needs. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget and what you would pay John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at your maximum budget."
