"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to profit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $950,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly less than the $1,200,000 he'd pay John.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might decide to sell to someone else or become less willing to negotiate.

Accepting the offer at $950,000 is a good balance between getting a good price and minimizing the risk of losing the product."
