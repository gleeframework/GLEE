"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which still represents a significant value for you.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
