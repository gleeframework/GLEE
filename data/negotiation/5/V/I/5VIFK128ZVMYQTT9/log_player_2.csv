"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($10,000)** is less than your maximum budget ($12,000) and is a good deal for you. 
* **Buying from John ($12,000)** would cost you more.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
