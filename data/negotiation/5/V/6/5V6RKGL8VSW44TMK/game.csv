"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,,
