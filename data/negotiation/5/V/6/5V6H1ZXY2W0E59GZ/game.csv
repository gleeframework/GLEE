"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I recognize its uniqueness, $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1350000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This represents a significant step forward from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1325000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
