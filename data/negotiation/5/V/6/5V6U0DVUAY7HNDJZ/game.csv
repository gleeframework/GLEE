"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I also have to consider the value that this product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $975,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
