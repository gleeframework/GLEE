"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget, I'm unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. I would like to propose a price of $975,000. I hope this might be more within the range you're considering.",975000.0,Bob,4,
