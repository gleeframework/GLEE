"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need a price closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,000. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $13,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $14,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll counter with $13,500 again. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $13,500 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession. If you can meet me at $14,500, I'll close the deal. It's the best I can do. If not, I might have to move on to another buyer.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $14,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13,750. Can you consider this price?",13750.0,Bob,8,
