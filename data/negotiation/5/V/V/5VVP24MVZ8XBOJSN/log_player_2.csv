"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is still a significant markup from her $80 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the negotiation closer to a price that's good for both of us. It's still a decent profit for Alice, and a significant savings for me compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price, considering how much this product is worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, and $110 is a decent deal. It's not worth risking the negotiation by pushing further and potentially having to buy from John for $150."
