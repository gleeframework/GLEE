"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay under $1 million. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, potentially pushing the price down further.  There is still room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
