# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your budget. You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get closer to your $800,000 target."

While $900,000 is closer to your goal than Alice's first offer, it's still above your $800,000 budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, but if Alice won't budge, you can always buy from John."
