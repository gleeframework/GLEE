"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your business, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
