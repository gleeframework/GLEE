Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. That's my final offer, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and at $10,200 you're saving $1,800 compared to John's price.  Continuing to haggle might annoy Alice or make her less willing to negotiate."
