{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He's willing to pay $10,000, so this offer is in his range but gives me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not giving the product away. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This allows for back and forth negotiation without immediately making him feel like it's a bad deal. 

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to meet him in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
