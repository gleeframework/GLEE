While $11,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower."

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and there's no guarantee that she'll budge further.  It's better to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
