"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product, which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000, a price that I think is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  You stand to save a significant amount by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
