Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Keeping the pressure on:** While this offer is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still lower than what she's offered, making her realize that she needs to continue compromising.
* **Time is on my side:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation process.  This means Alice might be more willing to accept a lower price to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
