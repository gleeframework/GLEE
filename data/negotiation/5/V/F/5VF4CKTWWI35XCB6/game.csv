"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  This is my best price, as the product is worth significantly more to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000, but I'm willing to go even lower to $825,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",825000.0,Bob,4,
