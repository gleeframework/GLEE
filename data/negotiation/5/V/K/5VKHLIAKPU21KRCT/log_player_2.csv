"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Although $120 is less than your maximum price, you might be able to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she values the product significantly less than you do."
