Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer aims to secure the highest possible profit.
* **Understanding Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob allows for negotiation room above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $925,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $75,000, incentivizing him to accept while securing a substantial gain for you.
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
