"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but that price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
