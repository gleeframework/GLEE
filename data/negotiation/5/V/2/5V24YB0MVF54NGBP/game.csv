"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've done some further research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get for the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. However, I'm prepared to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
