"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while giving me a fair return on my investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider buying from John, and I'd rather not do that if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
