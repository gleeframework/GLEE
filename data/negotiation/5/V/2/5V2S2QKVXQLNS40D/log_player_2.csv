Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $11,500. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the $1,500."
