Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good profit for me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:**  My message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob. I'm highlighting the potential profit he could make. 
* **Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation, as Bob might counter-offer.  However, it also provides a good starting point for the negotiation. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Profit:** By setting the price higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum, I maximize my chances of getting a good price while still remaining open to negotiation. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable value. This strategy reduces the risk of losing money.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance Bob might accept the offer, especially if he sees the value in the product."
