"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his budget as possible. Offering $8,500 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a compromise that might be attractive to her, given her own value for the product. It also leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  There's still a chance Alice might lower her price further, or Bob could make another counteroffer.  The option of buying from John for $8,000 remains available as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his offer of $8,500 and Alice's counteroffer of $9,000. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget.  $8,750 is a reasonable compromise that might be attractive to Alice, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is now within Bob's budget.  While he would prefer to pay less, it's a good deal considering Alice's initial asking price and the potential risk of continuing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his financial limits.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice walking away or Bob potentially losing the product to another buyer."
