"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's work together to make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, but  $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a great price for a product that will significantly benefit your business. I'm confident you won't find a better deal like this anywhere else.  Let's close this deal now.",900000.0,Alice,5,
