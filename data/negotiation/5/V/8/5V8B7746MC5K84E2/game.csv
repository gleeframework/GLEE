"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and my estimated value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. I'm offering $10,500. It's still a fair price for both of us, and a good compromise. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. Can you consider this compromise?",10250.0,Bob,4,
