"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This seems like a fair price considering both of our needs.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,550,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
