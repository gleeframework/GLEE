Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,000 is higher than Bob's value of $10,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $11,000 is still above your minimum value of $12,000, so you're still making a profit.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create room for negotiation and potentially get closer to your ideal price. Remember, you can always lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer!"
