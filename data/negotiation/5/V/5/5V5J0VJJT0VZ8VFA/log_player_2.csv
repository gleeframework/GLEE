# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. Considering the product's worth to me is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $8250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. As I mentioned earlier, the product is worth $8000 to me, and I'm not willing to give it away. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $8100. This is a reasonable price, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $8,100.** This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer at $8,100 will save him $3,900 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiating further could be risky.**  There's a chance Alice could reject further counteroffers, and Bob might end up having to pay John's higher price or miss out on the product entirely.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most strategic move for Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid further potential losses."
