Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm happy to pay $7500 for it. This is a fair price considering your own valuation, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.
