Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $19,000, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting close to John's offer. It's better to secure a deal at $16,500 than risk Bob walking away and only getting $15,000 from John."
