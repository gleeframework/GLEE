"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$5,000 is a very good price, but there's room for negotiation. Since we have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This allows for some room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Alice to come down to a more acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from the initial offer, which is not ideal. However, I'm still willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better price. Buying from John at $12,000 is a last resort, and I want to explore more options with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone up, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer continues to increase, and now it's getting closer to my maximum limit. However, I still have some rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit, especially since I've shown a willingness to compromise in the previous rounds. Buying from John is still my last resort, and I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her price, and we are getting closer to my maximum limit. However, I'm still trying to get the best possible deal. I'm increasing my offer again to show flexibility but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accept this counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept a price slightly higher than my initial target, but only if it's the best I can get."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, and we're getting closer to my limit. I only have 3 rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Alice. It's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating, and I'm worried about being stuck with a price that's too high for my budget. Therefore, it's time to secure the product from John at $12,000, which is my maximum limit.  It's not the ideal price, but it ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further price increases from Alice."
