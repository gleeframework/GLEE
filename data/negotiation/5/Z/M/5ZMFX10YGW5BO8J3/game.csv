"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Let's start at $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $150 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $125 for the product? This way, both parties are satisfied.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we settle on $115? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire the product within your budget while still providing a reasonable profit margin for us.",115.0,Alice,5,
