"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win here. How about $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
