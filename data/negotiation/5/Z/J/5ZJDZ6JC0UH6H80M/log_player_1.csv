"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product. It's also a good starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds. I'll be keeping a close eye on the value of the product to Bob, and I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I believe I won't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't see a reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price considering the product's value. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving Bob an opportunity to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better offer.  I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds in order to maximize my profit. However, I am starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, and I'm definitely keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. I'm now very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be seriously considering selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I've reached my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining, and I don't want to waste time haggling over a small difference in price.  While I'm not thrilled about settling for the minimum, it's a better outcome than selling to John for the same price."
