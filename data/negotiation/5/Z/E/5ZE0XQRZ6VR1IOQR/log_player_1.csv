"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my desired minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" framing the product as highly desirable. 
* **Future Rounds:**  This initial offer sets the stage for subsequent rounds, where I can gradually decrease the price while assessing Bob's counteroffers and gauging his willingness to pay.  
* **John Option:**  Keeping the John option ($1,500,000) in mind ensures I have a fallback if negotiations with Bob don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value and the potential for a successful partnership.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I'm choosing to reject and counter-offer in hopes of closing the gap and reaching a more favorable agreement.  I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and positions us for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my price significantly from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still substantially above Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I continue to emphasize the ""unique value"" to reinforce a perception of high worth. 
* **Pressure:**  By mentioning this is a ""significant compromise,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to take this counteroffer seriously. 
* **Observation:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,400,000 was notably above his perceived value of $1,200,000. This suggests he might be willing to go higher, making me optimistic about bridging the remaining gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,650,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
