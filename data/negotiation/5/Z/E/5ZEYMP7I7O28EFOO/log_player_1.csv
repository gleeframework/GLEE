Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This allows for a back and forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and hopefully leads to a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I have the luxury of rejecting his low offer and seeing if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. 
* **Signalling Flexibility:** This demonstrates I'm open to negotiation while maintaining my target price.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:**  $11,000 allows for a potential counteroffer that could be acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Quite:** $10,500 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I can still get a much better deal with John, who's willing to pay my full asking price.
* **Room for Counteroffer:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll aim for a price closer to my target range in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Fairness:**  This signals that I'm willing to work with Bob and reach a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Getting Closer:** While $11,250 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's last offer.
* **Pressure:** By offering a compromise and demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to considering buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** Even though Bob is mentioning John, $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price and much lower than what John is offering.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob's statement about being ""close to considering buying from John"" suggests he's at his limit, and further negotiations are unlikely to lead to a better price. 
* **John's Offer is a Safe Bet:** Since John is willing to pay my full asking price, it makes more sense to secure the sale with him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
