,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value of this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to considering buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,
