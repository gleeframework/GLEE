Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $13000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  $13,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $13,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can push for a better deal and get closer to my target of $14,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $13,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13400}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I'm willing to pay $13300 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, the time is getting short. I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds, and selling to John would be a considerable loss for me.  $13,300 is a decent compromise and a good outcome overall."
