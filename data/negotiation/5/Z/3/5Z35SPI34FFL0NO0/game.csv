"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls quite a bit short of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects its inherent worth while still providing you a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
