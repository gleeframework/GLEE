"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,400,000 from John. There's room to negotiate with Alice, as she values the product at $1,200,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation of the product, leaving room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and closer to your desired price range. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a good price while saving money. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gains."
