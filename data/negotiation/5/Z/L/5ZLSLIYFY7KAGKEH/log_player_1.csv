Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, aiming for a price close to that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,000 or a bit less still earns you significantly more than your $10,000 backup offer from John."
