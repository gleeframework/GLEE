"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $120, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  $160 is a good middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the profit.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm dropping my price to $155, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and leaves some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price I'm happy with from Bob.  With John offering $150, it's a more secure option and meets my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell to John."
