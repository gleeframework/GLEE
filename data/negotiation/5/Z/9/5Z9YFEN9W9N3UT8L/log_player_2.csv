The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $135. I'm not willing to pay more than my value for the product. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $110 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my value for the product is $120."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This is still below Alice's current offer, and closer to my target price. I hope she'll be willing to accept this offer."

Alice's offer of $122 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay. Since John is willing to sell me the product for $120, I'll buy from him."
