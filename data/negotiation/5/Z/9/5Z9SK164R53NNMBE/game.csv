"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway between our offers at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to get the price you're comfortable with, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we compromise at $10,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible.",10500.0,Bob,4,
