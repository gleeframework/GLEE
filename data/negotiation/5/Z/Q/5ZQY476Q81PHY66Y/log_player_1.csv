{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  I'm asking $1,800,000 for it, a price I believe reflects its significant value.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only offer $1500000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more.  There are 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk it and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
