{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want at least $12,000, so $13,500 gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so a price too far above that might make him immediately reject. 
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  You've left room for Bob to counteroffer and for you to make adjustments based on his response. 

Remember, this is just the first step!  Be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's reaction and your own desire to finalize the sale quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $12,000. While you could sell to John for $12,000, rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counter-offer is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above your minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  By splitting the difference, you're showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your desired range.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in your offer. 

Remember, the goal is to get the best price possible while still ensuring a sale. This counter-offer should hopefully get Bob closer to your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  You're better off rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher price:**  By continuing to negotiate, you have the potential to get closer to your desired price point.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If you sell to John for $12,000, you'll secure a decent profit but might be leaving some money on the table.  
* **Time investment:**  While negotiations take time, if you believe Bob might be willing to go higher, it's worth the effort.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to $11,000 or $11,250. Try to find a price point that's acceptable to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,250? That's halfway between my last offer and yours, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer of $11,500 and his current offer of $10,500. 
* **Reasoning:**  It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above your minimum price of $12,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the offer. 

This counter-offer should hopefully push Bob closer to your desired price point, but be ready to adjust further based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to your minimum desired price of $12,000. While you could sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer has several benefits:

* **Secure a sale:** You're guaranteed a sale, which is important if you want to finalize the deal quickly. 
* **Minimize risk:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to a rejection from Bob, leaving you with no sale and the potential of losing a valuable buyer.
* **Reasonable profit:**  While it's not your ideal price, $11,000 still provides a decent profit.  

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical and practical decision."
