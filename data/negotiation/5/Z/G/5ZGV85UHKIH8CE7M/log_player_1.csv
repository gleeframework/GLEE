"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get more than $12,000 and also see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a better price than $12,000.  While selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to be more appealing to Bob, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds,  I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I still have a few rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $12,500. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while also protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiations are not going well.  While I'm not happy about not getting a higher price, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.   I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000 to ensure I get a fair value for my product."
