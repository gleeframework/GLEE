You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still more than your target of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still above your target of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and a good starting point for a final agreement. If you're not interested in this offer, I'll need to consider my other options.
