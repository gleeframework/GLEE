"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and a good starting point for a final agreement. If you're not interested in this offer, I'll need to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price given our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
