{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately pushing Bob to reject.

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I will adjust my offers based on Bob's response and my desire to maximize profit while also considering the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown interest, his offer of $900,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a better offer from Bob. Rejecting his offer will allow me to counter with a more favorable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground that is more advantageous for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving a significant margin for myself.
* **Presenting a reasonable compromise:**  The price of $1,050,000 represents a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but this counteroffer is a step closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still significantly less than my desired $1,500,000. 
* **The risk of selling to John is getting higher:**  Each round of negotiation is costing me time, and the potential of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000 is becoming more tempting. 
* **Room for another counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm not ready to give up just yet, but I need to be strategic about my next offer.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer again, but this time I will be more firm and push closer to my desired price. I will also be more mindful of the potential opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and a good starting point for a final agreement. If you're not interested in this offer, I'll need to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being more firm with my counteroffer, moving closer to my desired price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that this price is still beneficial for him.
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm subtly implying that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll be more inclined to sell to John. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll move forward with selling the product to John. I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000 as it significantly impacts my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price given our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and I'm concerned about the opportunity cost of continuing.  
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is more than what Bob is offering.  

**Conclusion:**  While I would like to have negotiated a higher price with Bob, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price is not worth the potential reward. I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision for maximizing my profit at this time."
