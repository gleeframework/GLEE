Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest at a premium price (50% above your minimum). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum while still below his perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and are comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting outright. If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to $1,500,000 would be more appropriate."
