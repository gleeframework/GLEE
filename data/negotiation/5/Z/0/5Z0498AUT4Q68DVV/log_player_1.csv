"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $175 gives Bob some space to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, his message shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Aiming for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $150? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm  countering with a price that's exactly in the middle between Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, but with a positive and conciliatory tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a safer option:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep negotiating. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I will make a counteroffer in the next round to keep the negotiation open, just in case Bob gets closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $140. How about $145? This would be a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering my price from $150 to $145. However, I'm still above my minimum of $150 to ensure I'm getting a decent deal.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 5 rounds left, I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good price"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is critical:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me is too high. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150.
* **Minimizing losses:** While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a decent profit."
