Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $9,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,500}"
