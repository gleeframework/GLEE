Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John. This gives me some room to negotiate with Bob. It's also a reasonable starting point since the product is worth more to me than it is to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm dropping my price a bit from the initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to me, and it's a significant improvement over Bob's offer of $80."
