Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than his estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my earnings, but I'm also open to a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still a loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price point than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to accept a deal that would result in a loss for me. I'm confident that John will pay my desired price, so I'll choose to sell the product to him."
