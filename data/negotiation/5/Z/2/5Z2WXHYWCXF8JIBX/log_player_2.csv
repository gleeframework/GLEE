"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's unwise to accept the initial offer at $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially since you have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (70% of the original price) is a good strategy. This signals a strong desire to buy but sets a clear expectation of a lower price. It also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are more rounds available. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering her price.  A counteroffer of $8,000 shows you're willing to meet her halfway, while still aiming for a lower price. This strategy keeps the pressure on and might encourage Alice to make a further concession."
