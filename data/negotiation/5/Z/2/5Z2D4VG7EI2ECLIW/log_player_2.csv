"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price of $800,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  While your price is tempting, I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is significantly lower than her original price and closer to Bob's counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers or decide to sell to someone else.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
