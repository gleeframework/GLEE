Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its worth while also acknowledging your potential gains."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below what we value the product at.  We'll counter-offer in the next round to try and move closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize the value of the product, my budget is a bit tighter. Could we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above our guaranteed sale price with John. We'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints but I believe this product's value easily justifies a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,210,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,190,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,190,000. While we could try to push for a little more, we're already significantly above our safety net with John. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds, and secures a healthy profit."
