Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,000.  You've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which aligns with your goal of saving as much money as possible."
