"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your absolute highest offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",11500.0,Alice,5,
