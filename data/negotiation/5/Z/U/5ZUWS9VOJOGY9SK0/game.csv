"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However,  $1200000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $1000000.  This would be a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident in my offer of $1050000. This reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. It's a fair price considering we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
