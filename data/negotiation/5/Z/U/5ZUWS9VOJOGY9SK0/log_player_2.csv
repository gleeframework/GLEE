"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer immediately. It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to lower her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to potentially secure a lower price.  You can also use the fact that you have an alternative seller (John) to your advantage in negotiations."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident in my offer of $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. It's a fair price considering we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is still a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original asking price, and $1,080,000 is a good deal for you, especially considering your alternative option with John is $1,200,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and could result in you having to buy from John at a higher price."
