"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,500,000) and Alice's offer ($1,200,000). This gives you room to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within the range that is likely acceptable to her. By offering $1,000,000, you are signaling your serious interest in purchasing the product while also creating room for further negotiation.  You are aiming to split the difference between your desired price and her initial price. This approach allows for a more likely acceptance and a good outcome for both parties."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your maximum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. You have a significant buffer to work with and can try to bring the price down further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates your willingness to meet halfway, while still trying to secure a price lower than John's offer.  It's a reasonable proposition that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation and a deal that is beneficial to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for you.  It's significantly lower than John's price, and closer to your initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate risks getting stuck in a stalemate, and there's no guarantee you can get a better price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a price that is within your budget and a good value."
