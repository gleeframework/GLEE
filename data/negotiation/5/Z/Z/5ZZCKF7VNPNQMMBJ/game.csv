"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for proposing a counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This price reflects the product's unique features and the value it brings.  I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.
