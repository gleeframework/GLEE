Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $16,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. It's a win for me, and I can always try to get a better price in the future."
