# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation given its potential, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. While it's closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000, it's still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
