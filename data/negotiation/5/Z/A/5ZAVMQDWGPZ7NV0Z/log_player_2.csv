"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You have a few more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance you can get Alice closer to your target price.  Additionally, if you're unsuccessful, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise and still below my maximum.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'll take another step down to $13,500. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $13,500 is tempting, you've already shown you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  There are still a few rounds left, so it's worth seeing if you can get Alice closer to your target price of $12,000. You have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I'll meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $13,250 is still above your ideal price point of $12,000. You have a few more rounds to try and squeeze out a better deal. Additionally, you have the safety net of John's offer at $10,000, so there's no pressure to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,250, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free consultation to ensure you get the most out of the product. With this added value, I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 with additional benefits is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You've reached the final round of negotiations, and you've established that you're willing to walk away.  Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
