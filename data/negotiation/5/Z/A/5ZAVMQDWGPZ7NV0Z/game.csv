"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise and still below my maximum.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price at this point.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'll take another step down to $13,500. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's close this deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I'll meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,250, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free consultation to ensure you get the most out of the product. With this added value, I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,9,
