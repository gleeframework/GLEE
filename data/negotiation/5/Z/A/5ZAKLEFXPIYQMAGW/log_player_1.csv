"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium since he's a potential buyer and I don't know his valuation.  If he rejects this, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, even though it's more than John's offer.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than John's price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than John's offer. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping I can get him to come up to a price closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and finally agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is the same as John's offer, so I'm not losing any money by selling to Bob at this price.  If he rejects, I'll go with John, but hopefully he sees this as a fair deal."
