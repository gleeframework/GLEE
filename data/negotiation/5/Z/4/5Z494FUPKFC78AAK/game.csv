"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer you $750000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also shows that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $800000? This price aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's value, and it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
