"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It makes no sense to accept the offer. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe reflects its fair market value. I'm confident this price is reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still not within Bob's acceptable range. Bob should reject this offer and continue to negotiate or look at other options."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 remains above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  I'm eager to reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
