"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of your product, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This would give me a reasonable margin for profit and be a good starting point for our negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating our pricing strategy, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value we believe the product holds, but we're willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for sticking to your offer, Bob. We understand your concerns, but we're still willing to make a concession. We're now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This price is closer to your original offer, and we believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit.  It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're still not willing to go below $1,125,000. We believe this price reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring to your business. We're willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your latest one. We're offering the product to you for $1,112,500. This is our final compromise, and we hope you'll consider it.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
