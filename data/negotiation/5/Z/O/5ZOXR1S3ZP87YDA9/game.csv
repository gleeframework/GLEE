"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $12,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $12,000.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase right away.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,400, which is the best I can do. This is already a concession from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12400.0,Alice,5,
