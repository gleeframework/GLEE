Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning any price below that offers him a surplus.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you aim to capture the maximum possible profit while still providing Bob an incentive to buy. He gets a $5 discount, and you get $15 more than your minimum acceptable price."
