Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* This strategy is designed to maximize my potential earnings. By starting high, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.
* If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my counteroffers accordingly.
* Having John as a backup buyer gives me security and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Is that something you'd be open to discussing? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $12,000 and my minimum of $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13,500 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:**  I reiterate the idea of a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Flexibility:** While I'm moving closer to my minimum, I'm still open to negotiation and haven't set a hard line. 

**Strategy:**

* By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm aiming to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
*  I want to avoid a situation where I have to accept John's offer of $10,000, as I believe the product is worth more.
*  I'm willing to be flexible, but I will remain firm in my desire to sell the product for at least $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. It's a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it's within a reasonable range.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become unwilling to pay more. It's better to secure a good price now rather than risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to move on and potentially pursue other opportunities or deals.  

**Decision:**

* Given the closeness to my minimum acceptable price and the potential risks of continued negotiation, I have chosen to accept Bob's offer of $13,000."
