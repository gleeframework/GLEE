"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Is that something you'd be open to discussing?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is a good starting point, but it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13500 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
