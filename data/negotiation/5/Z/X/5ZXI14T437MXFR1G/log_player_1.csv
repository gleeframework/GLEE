Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This price leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win situation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While John offers the full value, it's important to try and get the best possible price from Bob first. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the deal's value and encourages a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 to $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal,  there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Seeking a Better Price:** It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my minimum price with a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridge the Gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I get a decent return.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** This counteroffer suggests a potential win-win scenario, giving Bob a better price than his initial offer while still allowing me to get closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $900000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $900,000 is significantly closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 than Bob's previous offer.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely I'll get much closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I could end up selling to John at a lower price.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might take longer, potentially delaying a sale and causing opportunity costs.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price, minimizes risk, and ensures a timely sale."
