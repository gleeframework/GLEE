{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also clearly communicates the value of the product to Bob.  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with some strategic counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's not unreasonable given the value he sees in the product.  However, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant margin for you, and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and keeps things moving forward. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price, and it's higher than what John is offering.  While I'd love to push for a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price and avoid any further negotiation."
