"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant margin for you, and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and keeps things moving forward. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
