Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer it for $800,001 and guarantee a sale, our goal is to maximize profit.  We know John will pay full price, giving us a strong fallback position.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product significantly below John's price ($1,400,000) makes it appealing to Bob while still leaving a substantial profit margin for Alice. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and presenting a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and maintaining the option to sell to John at full value if needed."
