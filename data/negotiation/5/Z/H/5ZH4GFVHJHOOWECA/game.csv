"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,200, which is a great compromise. It's still a good deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
