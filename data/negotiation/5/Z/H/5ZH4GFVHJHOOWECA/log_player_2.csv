"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"", 
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) than Alice's initial price ($9,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating my budgetary constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer invites Alice to counter back, hopefully leading to a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,200, which is a great compromise. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my budget, her offer of $8,200 is still higher than John's $8,000 price. I'll try negotiating one more time to see if I can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's latest offer ($8,200) and my previous offer ($6,500). It's a strong negotiating tactic that shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I've added a phrase indicating I'm ready to ""close the deal"" at $7,500. This adds a sense of urgency and might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm still keeping in mind that John is offering the product for $8,000. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally matched John's offer of $8,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John, as I won't get a better price. It's time to accept the offer and get the product."
