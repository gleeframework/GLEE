Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to negotiate closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can convince Bob to pay more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. I believe this price still offers you a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find this product for a better price anywhere else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I am willing to pay up to $12,500 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting close to what I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to risk losing this deal completely, so I'll accept his offer."
