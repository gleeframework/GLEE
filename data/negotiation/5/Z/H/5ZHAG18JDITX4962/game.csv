"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. I believe this price still offers you a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find this product for a better price anywhere else. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I am willing to pay up to $12,500 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
