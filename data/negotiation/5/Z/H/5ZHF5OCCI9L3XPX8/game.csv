"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon, as I'm also considering other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
