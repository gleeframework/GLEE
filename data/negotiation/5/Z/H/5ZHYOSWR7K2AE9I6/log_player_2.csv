You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can either try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $80."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum of $80.  At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that you won't be able to get Alice to go lower."
