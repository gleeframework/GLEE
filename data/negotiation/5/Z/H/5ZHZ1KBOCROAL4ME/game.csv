"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
