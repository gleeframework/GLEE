{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start a negotiation slightly higher than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, there's a good chance he'd be willing to pay a price slightly lower than that. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to counteroffer or for you to come down slightly in price if he hesitates. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still below the midpoint between your starting price and his initial offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate and creates a sense of fairness by meeting in the middle of the previous offers ($115 and $105).
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:**  The $110 price point still ensures a profit above your minimum selling price to John.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Leverage:**  While you're moving closer to Bob's offer, you're still in a strong position. You haven't conceded too much and can always re-evaluate if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While you could try to negotiate further, Bob's offer of $107 is only $3 less than your last counteroffer. The potential gain from another round of negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting the $107 offer now secures a good profit and allows you to move on to other potential deals. 
* **Exceeding Your Minimum:**  Remember, your minimum acceptable price is $100. Bob's offer is a $7 profit over that, making it a reasonable deal."
