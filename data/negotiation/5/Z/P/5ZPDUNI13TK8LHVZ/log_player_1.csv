{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It also positions the offer as a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $110. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save a bit more money too. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $112. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $112, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $108. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, Bob's offer of $108 is still above my minimum of $100 and close enough to be a good deal. It's also clear that Bob is not willing to go higher, so accepting his offer is the best option to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
