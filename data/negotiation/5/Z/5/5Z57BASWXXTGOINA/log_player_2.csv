"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  We don't want to go too low too quickly and risk offending her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're continuing to negotiate in a way that shows Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're also holding firm to our budget. This back-and-forth is typical in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'll offer you a compromise at $105. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good price and Alice seems firm. It's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down."
