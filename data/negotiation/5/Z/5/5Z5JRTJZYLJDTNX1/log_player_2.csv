"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $125
* **Your Value:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Since Alice's offer is lower than your value for the product and lower than John's price, accepting her offer is the best option. This allows you to save money compared to buying from John."
