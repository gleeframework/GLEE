# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would still provide a good value while allowing me to respect my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.
