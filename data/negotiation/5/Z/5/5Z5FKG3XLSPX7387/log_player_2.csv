"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is way below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a good deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to my desired price, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. John offers the product for $120, which is my maximum budget. Accepting Alice's offer at $125 would mean overpaying."
