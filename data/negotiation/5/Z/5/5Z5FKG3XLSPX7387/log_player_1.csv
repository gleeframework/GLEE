Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while understanding that Bob might not be willing to pay my initial price. This strategy allows for a negotiation process, but I have a backup option (selling to John) if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is way below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for both of us.  This encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to meet halfway to incentivize Bob to accept.  This is a common negotiation tactic to show flexibility and demonstrate a willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $135 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can get closer to a price that is profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $125, which is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows that I am willing to compromise while still ensuring I receive a profit.
* **Message:** I reiterate my willingness to be flexible and emphasize that the proposed price is fair for both of us. I also aim to boost Bob's confidence in the product.

**Strategy:**

I believe offering a price that is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer is a good strategy. It shows that I am willing to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable outcome for myself.  I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
