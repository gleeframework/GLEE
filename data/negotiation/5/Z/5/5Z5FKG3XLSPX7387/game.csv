"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $135 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that work for you?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
