"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's room for both parties to find a price that works better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you consider $10,500? It's still a good price for you and closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $11000?  It's still a good deal for you and closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product."
