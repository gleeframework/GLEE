"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you be willing to go down a bit more?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $70 is still quite low for me. How about we make it $85 and call it a deal?",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I'm happy to go up a bit, but $85 is a tad high for me. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
