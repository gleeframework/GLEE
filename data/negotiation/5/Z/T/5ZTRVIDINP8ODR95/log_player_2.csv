"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  
* **Fairness:** $850,000 is still a good profit for Alice, considering she values the product at $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob leaves some room for Alice to counter, making the negotiation more likely to succeed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While $975,000 is a better deal than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By rejecting, Bob risks that Alice might walk away, but the potential reward of a lower price is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness:**  $900,000 is still a good deal for Alice, leaving her with a significant profit.
* **Last Stand:** Bob is likely making this his last counteroffer before considering John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Savings:** Alice's offer is only $15,000 lower than John's price.  At this point, the potential savings are minimal.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, where neither party is willing to budge, and Bob would miss out on the opportunity to buy the product.
* **Time is Money:** Bob's goal is to save money. The longer he negotiates with Alice, the more time and energy he's spending.

**Conclusion:** It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John for $1,000,000, ensuring Bob gets the product without further negotiation."
