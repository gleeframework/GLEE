"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great value at $18,000, which is below its true market value. I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  This is my top offer, let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great deal considering the value I'm getting from the sale. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm committed to buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm ready to close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
