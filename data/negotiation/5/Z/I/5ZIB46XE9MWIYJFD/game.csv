"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60 for the product?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75? That would be a great deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
