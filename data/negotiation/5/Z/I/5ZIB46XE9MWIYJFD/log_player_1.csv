Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, knowing that Bob values the product less. This will give me room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I also want to keep in mind the option of selling to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to what the product is worth to me. While I'd like to make a sale, it's not worth accepting such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75? That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to take such a big loss. I'll make another counteroffer, but if he continues to refuse, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a lower price, but still closer to my minimum. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not going to let Bob undervalue the product. If he rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
