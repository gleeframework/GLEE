"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I appreciate your time. However,  $22,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $22,000 represents the high-end of the value for this product, I understand your budget constraints.  I could be flexible, but $9,000 is too low.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  Could we settle at $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I see you're serious about the product, and I want to make a deal. However, I need a price that reflects the true value. How about we split the difference again and land at $13,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, I am serious about this product.  However, that price is still a bit beyond my comfort zone. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and brings us closer to a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, $12,000 is getting very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $12,750.  This offer takes into account our negotiations and represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've done a good job of explaining your position.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but $12,750 is  still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $12,375? That's my final offer.",12375.0,Bob,8,
