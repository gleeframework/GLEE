**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting too low. While further negotiation is possible, the increments are getting smaller, and it's unlikely Bob will come close to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer is the safest option to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
