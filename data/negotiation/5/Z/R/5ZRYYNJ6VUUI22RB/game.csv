"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Alice,5,
