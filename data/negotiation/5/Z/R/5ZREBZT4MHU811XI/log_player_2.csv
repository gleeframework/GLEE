Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a bit further, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000 which is good enough for your goals."
