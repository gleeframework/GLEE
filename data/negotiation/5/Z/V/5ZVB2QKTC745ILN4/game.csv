"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is my final offer, and it's a great price for a product of this quality. Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  This is the highest I can go, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",125.0,Bob,6,
