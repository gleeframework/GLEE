"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is too high, and there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and he has 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above what Bob is comfortable paying.  He wants to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. He has 8 rounds left to reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer given its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's well below his maximum budget, and he's saved $450,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and he could end up with a worse deal. It's better to secure this favorable price while he still has time."
