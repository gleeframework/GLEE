"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer given its value to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
