"I understand that you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1700000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1680000 is the minimum I can accept. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,
