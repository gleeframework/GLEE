Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, and still allows me to make a profit, but not as much as I would with John. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
