Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its significant worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances he'll be willing to pay a premium.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to aim high with Bob."
