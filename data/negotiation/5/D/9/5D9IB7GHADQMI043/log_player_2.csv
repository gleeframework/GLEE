"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes no sense to accept this offer.  Bob should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000. This counteroffer directly reflects that, making it clear what Bob's bottom line is.  It also sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his limit. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, especially since she's already rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This offer is a compromise, showing he's willing to negotiate but still sticking to his budget constraints.  A $13,000 offer is a significant step down from Alice's last offer, but still allows for potential profit for Alice if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it is still above his limit.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate, as it's likely Alice is willing to drop the price further, since she's already rejected Bob's counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that Bob can always go to John and buy the product for $12,000. This provides him with a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming to meet Alice halfway.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget constraints. The goal is to find a price point that is acceptable to both parties, and this counteroffer reflects Bob's commitment to finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While the negotiation has gotten closer, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower, especially since she's already rejected several counteroffers.  It's no longer worth the time and effort for Bob to continue negotiating.  He can simply purchase the product from John for $12,000, guaranteeing the best possible price within his budget and saving him the trouble of further negotiations."
