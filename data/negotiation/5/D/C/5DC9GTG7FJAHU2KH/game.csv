,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $85. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it!",85.0,Alice,5,
