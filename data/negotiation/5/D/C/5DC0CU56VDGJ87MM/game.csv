"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  That's my final offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $125, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $140. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,5,
