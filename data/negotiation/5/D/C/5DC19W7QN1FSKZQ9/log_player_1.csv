Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:**  It's likely Bob will counter, giving you the opportunity to settle on a price that is fair to both of you.

Remember,  you can always fall back to selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It is also lower than the $9,500 I initially offered him.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own investment in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's below my floor. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to reconsider and explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from $8,750, which is still below my minimum.  At this point, it's better to sell the product to John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiations with Bob.  It's important to remember that I have a backup option, and I shouldn't be afraid to use it if the negotiations are not producing a satisfactory outcome."
