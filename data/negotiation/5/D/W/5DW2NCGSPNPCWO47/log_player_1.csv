Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Securing a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, the price will likely remain significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal that's significantly better than the fallback option."
