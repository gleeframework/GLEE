"Bob,  $12,000 is too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far off. How about $14,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
