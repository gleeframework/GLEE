"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to:

* **Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate:**  Her initial offer might be high. 
* **Potentially get a lower price:**  By making a counteroffer, Bob can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  A counteroffer of $750,000 is a strong starting point:

* **Substantial Reduction:** It's a 17% reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** It gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured into a drastic price drop. 
* **Still within Bob's Budget:**  It's well below Bob's maximum limit of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $850,000 is a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's initial offer.
* **Saving Money:** This price is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it risks losing the deal altogether, especially as Alice has already rejected one of Bob's offers.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation that might lead to a higher price or no deal at all."
