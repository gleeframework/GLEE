"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in buying it for $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $9,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value I'm placing on the product and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",9750.0,Bob,6,
