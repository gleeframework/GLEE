"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's worth significantly more to you than the price I'm asking. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired profit while still being below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the potential value Bob would gain by purchasing the product, making it more appealing. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high bar and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my price down in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's rejection of my initial offer indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still potential to reach a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, keeping in mind the potential to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer but still remains above Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value Bob will receive, encouraging him to see the potential in the deal.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer tests the waters, seeing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer, but I'll also be more receptive to selling to John as the number of rounds dwindles."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the price you're willing to sell it for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price point, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise, which suggests there's room for a slightly higher counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. If he rejects again, I'll be more open to selling to John in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the willingness to compromise.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach a final agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:**  I'm offering a small reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Middle ground:**  $1,050,000 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Emphasis on closure:**  I reiterate the goal of reaching a final agreement and closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final push to get Bob to accept a price closer to my desired target. If he rejects again, I'll be much more open to selling to John in the next round as the time for negotiation is running out."
