"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's worth significantly more to you than the price I'm asking. Let's get this deal done!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the price you're willing to sell it for.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the willingness to compromise.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach a final agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
