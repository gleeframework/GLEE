"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's stated the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, that's likely an overestimate. It's more likely Bob values it at closer to $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still above Bob's maximum.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and Bob can likely squeeze out a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but the price is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can likely get a better price with another counteroffer, especially as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,112,500. This price is a significant step closer to my desired price, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1112500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,112,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,120,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's target price.  While Bob could buy from John at this point, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice for a few more rounds.  There's a good chance Alice will drop below $1,100,000, which would be a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $1,115,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1115000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,115,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,122,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in the 9th round and Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price.  There's only one round left, and there's a high chance Alice will not go below Bob's target price.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as this is a guaranteed deal at a lower price."
