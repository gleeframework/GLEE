"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair given the value to both of us, and it gives us a solid starting point for further negotiation.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and provides a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
