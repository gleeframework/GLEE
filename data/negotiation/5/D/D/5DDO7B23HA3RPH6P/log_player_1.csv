"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum threshold. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** Leaving space for negotiation gives me leverage if Bob makes a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** 

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the following rounds.  If he rejects, I'll consider dropping the price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, it still doesn't allow me a significant profit margin. I'm aiming for a larger return on my product. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially drive the price up further. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. I'll also factor in his budget limitations and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see that you're serious about making this deal work.  While $1,400,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,600,000, he's getting a good deal based on the product's worth to him. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, indicating I'm not desperate for a sale.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response in this round, I'll either:

* **Accept:** If Bob agrees to $1,600,000, I'll close the deal.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, I might lower my price slightly, but I'll be cautious about going too low. 
* **Sell to John:** If Bob seems unwilling to budge, I'll consider selling to John to secure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum threshold for profit.  
* **No Further Negotiation:**  At this point, I've already conceded a significant amount from my initial offer. Trying to push for a higher price risks losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with no sale at all. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, the potential for a failed negotiation and no sale outweighs the possibility of getting a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids any further negotiation risks."
