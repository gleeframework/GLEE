# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this, and $20000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $21500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can do $21500, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. Can you meet me at $21500, or is there a different price you're thinking of?
