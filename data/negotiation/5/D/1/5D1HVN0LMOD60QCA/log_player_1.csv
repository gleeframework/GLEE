Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above my minimum desired value but also leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation, while also showcasing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counter his offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at $9,000 is too high, but $9,500 is my maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $9,500."
