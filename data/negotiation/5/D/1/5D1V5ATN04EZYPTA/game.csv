"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1000000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, reflecting the value and potential of the product. This price is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and it's still within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
