,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  While $17,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far apart from $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, my absolute top end is $14,000.  If you're willing to meet there, I'll take it. Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we try $16,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's worth it to me.",16500.0,Alice,7,
