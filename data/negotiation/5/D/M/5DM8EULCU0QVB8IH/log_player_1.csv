{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired value by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I can make it work on my end."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price.  I'm also considering the possibility that Bob might walk away entirely if I reject his offer."
