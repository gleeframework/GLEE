,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $10000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm proposing $9750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $9750 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $10250 as a final compromise. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,8,
