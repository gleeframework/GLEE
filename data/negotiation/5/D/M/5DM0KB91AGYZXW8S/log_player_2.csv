"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend around $10000, but I have to say that's a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's target price of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is the best price she's offered so far, and it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further offers, and he might be stuck with the higher price from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out altogether."
