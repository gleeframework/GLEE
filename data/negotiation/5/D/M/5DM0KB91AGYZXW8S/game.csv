"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend around $10000, but I have to say that's a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
