Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a substantial profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."

Bob's offer is now getting closer to my minimum. I'll accept it and secure a sale, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
