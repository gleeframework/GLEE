"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product name] for $130. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least $120 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $130 is close to your limit, you know John will sell you the same product for $120. You lose nothing by rejecting Alice's offer and saving the extra $10."
