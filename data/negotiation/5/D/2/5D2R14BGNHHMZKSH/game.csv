"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $12000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there though. $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
