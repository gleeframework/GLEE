Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product.
