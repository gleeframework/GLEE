Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also trying to establish a positive tone and open communication with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm rejecting his offer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to facilitate a deal. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 
I'm countering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to settle for it. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm countering with a price that is still above my minimum price but is a good compromise. I am trying to signal to Bob that I am willing to negotiate but that I am not willing to go too low. I am also reminding him of the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $800,000? This would be my final offer, as I know I can get it for that price elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, which is the same price John is willing to pay.  While it would be great to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids any further risk."
