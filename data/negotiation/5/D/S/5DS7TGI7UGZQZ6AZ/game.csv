"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to facilitate a deal. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $800,000? This would be my final offer, as I know I can get it for that price elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,6,
