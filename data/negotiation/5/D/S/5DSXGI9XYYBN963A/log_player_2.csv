# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above Alice's stated value.  You have a better option available.
