"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
