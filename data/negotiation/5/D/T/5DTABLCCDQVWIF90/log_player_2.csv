"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have a clear goal to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a potential better price through counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'm starting with a significant counteroffer.  $100 is a good starting point as it's a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not at my maximum value target.  Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to negotiate. There's a possibility Alice might be willing to lower the price further to close the deal before I choose to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm gradually increasing my counteroffer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price below my maximum. $110 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is only $8 away from my maximum value target.  Given that I'm already 5 rounds in and Alice's offer is within a reasonable range, it's time to accept.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better deal, but it also risks me losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting ensures I get the product within my budget, saving time and potentially securing a better price than John's."
