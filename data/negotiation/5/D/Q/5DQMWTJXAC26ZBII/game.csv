"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to. $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $9,000 is closer, but I still need to make a profit on this product. Let's split the difference and go with $9,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to make a sale.",9500.0,Alice,5,
