"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $120.  Since Alice offered $110, it's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is $109, which is still within your budget and closer to your target price. It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially get a slightly lower price, especially since you can always buy from John for $120."
