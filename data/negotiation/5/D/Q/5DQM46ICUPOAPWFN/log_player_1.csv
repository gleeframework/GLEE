Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

This is a calculated risk.  Here's the reasoning:

* **My Minimum:**  I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, so that's my floor.
* **Potential Upside:**  I'm aiming for a significant profit, so I'm offering a price 50% higher than my minimum. This assumes Bob might value the product more than John, and I'm hoping to capture some of that potential extra value.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed the $1,000,000 from John.  But, if Bob accepts, I earn a much larger sum.

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the reality of a potential alternative buyer."
