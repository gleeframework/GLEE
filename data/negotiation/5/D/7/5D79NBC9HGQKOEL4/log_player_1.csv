Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire [product name] at a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit While Staying Attractive:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, my goal is to maximize profit. Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($1,350,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price point leaves a little wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the price without directly revealing its worth to John."
