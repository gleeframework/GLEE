"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $100 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That product looks great, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, I'm aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** It's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Justification:**  While not strictly necessary, providing a brief reason for the counteroffer can help move the conversation along."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Lower Price:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving from $100 to $92. This suggests there's still room to haggle and potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Alice might not go much lower, the potential savings of even a few dollars outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice offered to meet ""halfway."" While her idea of halfway and mine differ,  proposing $88 shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increments:**  Moving in smaller increments now ($4 instead of $7) suggests I'm getting closer to my limit and encourages Alice to do the same.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:** I want to avoid getting stuck in a back-and-forth loop. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $95, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice's message suggests she's firm on her price and unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $95 is still within my $120 budget and represents a reasonable saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Continuing to negotiate risks either a stalemate or Alice walking away. Accepting now secures the product at a decent price."
