"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I understand it's worth more to you, but this is my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than $8,000. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and your potential to still profit from the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
