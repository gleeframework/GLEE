"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I understand it's worth more to you, but this is my maximum offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than $8,000. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and your potential to still profit from the sale.",10000.0,Bob,4,
