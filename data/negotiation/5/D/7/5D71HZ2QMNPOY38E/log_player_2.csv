"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than $8,000. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and your potential to still profit from the sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}
