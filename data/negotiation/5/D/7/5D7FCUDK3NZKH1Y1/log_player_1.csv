Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay slightly less. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing you a near-optimal price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  This price is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below your minimum acceptable price ($120), creating a potential win-win situation."
