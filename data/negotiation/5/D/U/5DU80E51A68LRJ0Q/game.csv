"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. This product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a substantial discount.  Please consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a significantly lower price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
