"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. This product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a substantial discount.  Please consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a significantly lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using classic negotiation tactics:

* **Inflating the product's value:** She claims it's worth $1,500,000 to me, but I have a maximum budget in mind. 
* **Pressure tactic:** She mentions another buyer at a lower price to make me anxious.

While her offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, there's a chance I could get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, I call her bluff and might get her to lower the price further. If she doesn't, I can always buy from John for $1,500,000 â€“ my maximum budget."
