You can get the product for less than $1,100,000 from Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000 which is still a good deal for you (since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000).  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation."
