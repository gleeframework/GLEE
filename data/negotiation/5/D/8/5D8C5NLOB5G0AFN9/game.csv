"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a unique item, but I'm not sure $15000 is within my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $8000? I'm very interested in this product and would love to make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $12000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9500. I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits. I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.
