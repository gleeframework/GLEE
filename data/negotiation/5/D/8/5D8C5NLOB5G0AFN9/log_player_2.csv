"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept at this point.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a unique item, but I'm not sure $15,000 is within my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I'm very interested in this product and would love to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $12,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $12,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and rejecting will allow me to make another counteroffer, hopefully pushing closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits. I truly hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still too high for my budget. While we've made progress in negotiations, I'm concerned that continuing will lead to a stalemate or an agreement that's still too expensive.  I've already spent several rounds and don't want to risk further delay. It's best to move on and purchase the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get a good deal within my budget."
