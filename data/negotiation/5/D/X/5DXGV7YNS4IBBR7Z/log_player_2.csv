(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's a significant gap between her offer and her likely minimum.
