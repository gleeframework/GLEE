"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a more realistic starting point given the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
