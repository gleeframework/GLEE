"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget and he can potentially get a better price from Alice or buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a more realistic starting point given the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he is still willing to pay $12,000 and can potentially get that price from Alice or buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm firm on $12,000. This is a fair price given the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
