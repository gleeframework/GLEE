"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident in the true potential of this product and  $1,200,000 falls quite a bit short of what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? ",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product can do. My final offer is $1,325,000. This offer reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this works for you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
