Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
