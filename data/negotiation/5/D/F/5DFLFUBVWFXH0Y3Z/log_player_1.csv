"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, aiming for a good starting point and leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $2,000,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers and a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in the next round while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am not able to pay such a high price. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to my budget of $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum,  and I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are 8 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge how serious Bob is about acquiring the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, but still lower than the initial offer. 
* **Strategic Reasoning:** My aim is to find a price point that's both profitable for me and appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This allows for a fair compromise while still ensuring a good profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:**  $1,750,000 still gives me a decent profit while being more attractive to Bob than my initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  My message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" and the profit for me, subtly reminding Bob of the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to determine if he's more willing to negotiate or if he's firm on his offer. 
* **Adjust Strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll either adjust my counteroffer further or consider selling to John if Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low."
