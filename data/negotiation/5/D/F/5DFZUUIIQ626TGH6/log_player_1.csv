Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I value closing the deal, accepting such a low offer would be a substantial loss.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll propose $860,000. I believe this is the best we can do without going over my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is clearly anchored at that $800,000 starting point. It's unlikely he'll move substantially higher.  This offer is above my guaranteed sale price and further haggling might push him away.
