"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $900000 price point. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the $975000 price point. I'm willing to pay up to $925000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $950000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
