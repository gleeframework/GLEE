{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm not sure if I can get my ideal price, but I want to explore the possibility of a higher offer before selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite enough. I've had 5 rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure I can push Bob any further.  I'm confident that selling to John will guarantee me the $8,000 minimum I need."
