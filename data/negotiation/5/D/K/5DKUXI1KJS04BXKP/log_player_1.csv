"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what he valued the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable price range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to sell to John for $150 makes accepting Bob's offer the most sensible choice at this point."
