Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $150 asking price represents a 25% markup, which is a reasonable starting point in many negotiation scenarios.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you have a fallback option, you don't want to price Bob out completely. Starting at $150 leaves room for potential negotiation if he counters with a lower offer."
