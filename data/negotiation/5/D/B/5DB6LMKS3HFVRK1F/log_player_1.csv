Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing a bottom line doesn't mean settling for it:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher is always preferable.
* **Bob's valuation is key:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above that. 
* **Starting high provides negotiation space:**  A higher initial offer allows me to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle if he counters. It also establishes the product's perceived high value.
* **The risk of losing Bob is mitigated:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
