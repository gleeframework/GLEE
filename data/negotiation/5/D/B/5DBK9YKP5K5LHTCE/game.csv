"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This offer reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
