"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe this price still reflects the value I'd derive from the product, but it's a more comfortable range for me. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion.
