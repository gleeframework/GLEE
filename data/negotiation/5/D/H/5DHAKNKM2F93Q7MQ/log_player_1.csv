"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial price. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to sell now, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is not in my range, I am willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation.  Let's continue working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $900,000 is a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market and the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. I'm not ready to accept yet, especially considering John is willing to pay my full asking price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the value of the product.  Would you be willing to come up to $850,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? It's a strong offer and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've only got 4 rounds left.  This feels like a good moment to secure a guaranteed deal with John, who is willing to pay my full asking price of $1,200,000. I'd rather not risk losing out on that opportunity, even though I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob."
