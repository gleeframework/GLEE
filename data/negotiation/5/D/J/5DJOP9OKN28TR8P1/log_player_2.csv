You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not interested in paying the full price of $12,000, so I'll consider Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer of $10,000 and see if she's willing to lower the price.
