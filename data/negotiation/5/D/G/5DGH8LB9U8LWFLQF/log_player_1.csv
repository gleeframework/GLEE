"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value for the product."
