I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go too low."
