"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,
