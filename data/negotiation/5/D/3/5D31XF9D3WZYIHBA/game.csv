"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",112.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $110, but I can't go any lower. If you're not interested in that price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",110.0,Alice,5,
