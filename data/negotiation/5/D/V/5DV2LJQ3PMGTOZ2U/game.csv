"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $12,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
