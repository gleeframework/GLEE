Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
