"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it has great potential for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about saving money.  
* **Fairness Focus:** The message emphasizes a fair deal for both sides, making it less likely for Alice to feel insulted and walk away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer is still above John's price, providing Alice with some incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product, and $950000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's counteroffer is only $25,000 higher than John's price.  
* **Further Negotiation Risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to more rounds, potentially pushing the price back up towards Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Constraint:** There are 7 rounds left.  Negotiating further could risk reaching the 10-round limit, potentially leading to a worse outcome.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as it's a relatively good deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
