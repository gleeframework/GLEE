"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000? ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
