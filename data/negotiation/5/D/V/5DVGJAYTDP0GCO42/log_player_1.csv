Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  I could be willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer, which is still considerably below my minimum acceptable price.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, ensuring I maximize my profit. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure thing with John."
