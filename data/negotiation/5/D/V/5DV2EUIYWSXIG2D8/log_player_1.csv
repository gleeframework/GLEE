Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value but below yours:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, and you still have room to lower the price a bit if needed. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows the negotiation to play out and potentially get a better price.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting with a lower price than your minimum, you signal that you're flexible and open to finding a fair price. 

Remember, you can always counter Bob's offers or walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would be a loss for you.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay your minimum price. It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $12,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to your minimum:** This shows you are willing to negotiate but are firm on your lower limit.
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the value of the product can encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** This keeps the door open for more back-and-forth if needed."
