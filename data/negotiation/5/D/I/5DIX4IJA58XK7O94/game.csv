,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000, or is that still a non-starter for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but that's my final offer. This product is truly worth more than that, but I want to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,5,
