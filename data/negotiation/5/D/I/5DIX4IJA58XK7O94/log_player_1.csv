"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000, or is that still a non-starter for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but that's my final offer. This product is truly worth more than that, but I want to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000, and we call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still within my acceptable range.  We've only got a few rounds left, so I'll counter again and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10,125.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,125, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm unwilling to go lower.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I'll be able to close a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent deal considering the time we've spent negotiating with Bob."
