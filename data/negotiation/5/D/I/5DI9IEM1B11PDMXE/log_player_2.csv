"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to try and get closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's still higher than your target price but leaves room for Alice to compromise without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to your target price, you can still potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again gives you another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,000. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still trying to keep the price below your maximum.  Hopefully, it will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
