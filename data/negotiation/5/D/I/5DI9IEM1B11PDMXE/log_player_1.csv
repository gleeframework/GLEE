Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, and it also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling the product.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I hope this will encourage him to accept the offer, but it still leaves me with a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the risk that Bob could reject another offer, or I could end up selling to John for $12,000, accepting this offer seems like the best option."
