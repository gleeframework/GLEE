Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  He values the product at $1,500,000, so this price is still attractive.
* **It's a strong starting position for you:** It's a good chunk of your minimum desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  Bob may counter, but you have room to move without dropping below your minimum. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly lower than the $1,400,000 offer I made, and further from my desired minimum of $1,000,000.  

By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can push closer to my desired price. It's possible Bob may meet me halfway, or we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's a lower price than my initial offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's a higher price than Bob's offer:** I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low.

This counteroffer gives Bob room to negotiate further, but also sets a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000."
