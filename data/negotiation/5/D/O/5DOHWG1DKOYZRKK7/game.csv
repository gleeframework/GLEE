,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a good compromise. I think you'll really appreciate the product, and this price is a fair reflection of its value.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
