"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to counter-offer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, as it's below my minimum valuation of $120.  I'll reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's also still above my minimum valuation, so I'm not losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his first, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject it and counter-offer again, hoping to nudge him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $95. This is a significant concession, but it demonstrates my willingness to find a deal. I'm still above my minimum valuation, so I'm not losing money. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my valuation, but it's still below my minimum. With several rounds left, I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to push him even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 92} 
```

I'm going to counter with $92. It's a small concession, but it signals that I'm serious about closing the deal. We're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John. It's not ideal to not get the maximum possible price, but given the time constraints and Bob's stubbornness, it's the most sensible choice."
