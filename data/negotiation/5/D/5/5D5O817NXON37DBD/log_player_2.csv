"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, there's still some room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $12,250. This is a final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can unfortunately move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer prevents the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
