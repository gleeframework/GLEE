"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  Her starting price is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $130?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps me firmly below my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $130, which would be $145. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is down to $145, which is within my $150 budget. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal from her, and it's better to save a little money than risk going over budget."
