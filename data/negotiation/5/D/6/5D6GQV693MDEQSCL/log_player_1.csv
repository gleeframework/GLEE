Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential"" of the product subtly hints at its value being higher than Bob's perceived $800,000.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Expressing willingness to discuss the price shows flexibility and encourages Bob to participate in the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're seeking a higher price.
* **John as leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000 gives you a strong position to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Step:** Prepare a counteroffer that falls between Bob's offer and your desired price, but still leans closer to your target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Starting by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer shows you're taking the negotiation seriously.
* **Standing Firm (For Now):** While you're coming down in price, the decrease is relatively small, signaling that you're still aiming for a high price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's ""potential"" reinforces your position that it's worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" aims to position the new price as a win-win.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above your minimum ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob is holding firm at $850,000, indicating this might be his maximum price.
* **Below Minimum:** Accepting his offer would still be a significant loss compared to your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John, meaning you don't have to settle for a low price.

**Next Step:** One more counteroffer might be worthwhile to see if Bob will budge. If he remains at $850,000, it's time to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to find a middle ground, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't go below $1,050,000 for this product.  This is my final offer. I believe it represents a significant discount on the true value you'll gain. If this doesn't work, I wish you the best in finding a solution that fits your needs."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This message makes it clear that this is your last offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down slightly to $1,050,000 shows flexibility but keeps you above your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** You're re-emphasizing the value proposition but also acknowledging that you might not bridge the gap.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning that you wish Bob well if the deal doesn't work out, you subtly hint that you have other options (John). 

**Outcome:**  This counteroffer will likely lead to one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob accepts:** You achieve a price above your minimum, albeit lower than your initial target.
2. **Bob rejects:** You walk away and sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
