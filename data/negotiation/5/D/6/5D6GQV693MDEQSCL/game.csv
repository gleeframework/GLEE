"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the significant value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to find a middle ground, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't go below $1,050,000 for this product.  This is my final offer. I believe it represents a significant discount on the true value you'll gain. If this doesn't work, I wish you the best in finding a solution that fits your needs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
