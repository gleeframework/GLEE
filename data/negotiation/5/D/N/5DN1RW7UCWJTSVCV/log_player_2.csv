"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $500,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John, so it makes sense to see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 40% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiation position. If Alice rejects this, we'll have room to move up while still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. I'm willing to pay more than $300,000, but I can still try to get a better deal closer to that price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significant discount. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a good deal while still saving me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $450,000 is a good deal. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and ending up buying from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for further savings.  It's time to lock in this deal and secure the product."
