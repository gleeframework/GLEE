"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high.  There is room for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer will allow you to make another counteroffer, hopefully getting closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to your desired price range, and it's still better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations failing."
