Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $108, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $150 is higher than I wanted to pay, it's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to a price I find acceptable.  It's better to secure the product now from John than risk the price going even higher with Alice."
