"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I've already decided that I'm not willing to go above $125. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.
