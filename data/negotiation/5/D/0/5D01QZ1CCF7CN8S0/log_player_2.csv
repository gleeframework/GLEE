"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his desired price point of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  He's being polite and showing interest in the product, but also stating his clear price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $100. While $115 is better than $120, it's still too high. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money.  He's proposing a price that's a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between his previous offer and her current offer.  This shows he's serious about a deal, but is still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $117.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $117.5 is better than the $120 from John, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his goal of $100. He has shown a willingness to compromise and is confident he can get a better deal. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $117.5 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $113.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 113.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also being realistic.  By offering a compromise again and pointing out the fairness of the deal, he's hoping to persuade Alice to accept.  He's still within his budget and only has a few rounds left to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $113.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $119.25. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his budget limit and Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further.  With only 3 rounds left, the potential savings are becoming too small to justify the risk of continued negotiation.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John, as he's guaranteed to get the product within his budget."
