Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to what I want, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $9,250 is a decent profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
