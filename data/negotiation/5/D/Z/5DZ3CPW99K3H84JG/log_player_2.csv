Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,450,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while also giving you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
