"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further or going with John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. At this point, it's more financially sensible to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
