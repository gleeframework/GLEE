"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
