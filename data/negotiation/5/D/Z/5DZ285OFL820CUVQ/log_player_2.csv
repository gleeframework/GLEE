Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $11000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12500 to make this work. This price still offers you a good value, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11500 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $12000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers.
