"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $11000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12500 to make this work. This price still offers you a good value, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $11500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11500 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $12000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I've already found another buyer who is willing to sell the product to me for $12000, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
