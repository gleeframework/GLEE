"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $10,000, which is a fair value considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her value than mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate. By starting low, I'm signaling that I'm looking for a good deal and putting the pressure on Alice to justify her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved significantly towards my offer, which is good. However, she's still considerably above John's price. I'm willing to play it out a bit longer and see if I can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?"", 
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm acknowledging Alice's compromise while proposing a counteroffer that splits the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($6,000). This keeps the negotiation moving and signals I'm willing to pay a premium over John's price but still aim for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still below my minimum.  How about we compromise at $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my bottom line!  There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they both offer the same price now.  It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to buy the product from Alice."
