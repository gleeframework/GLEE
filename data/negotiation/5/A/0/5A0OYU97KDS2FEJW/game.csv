"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $10,000, which is a fair value considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still below my minimum.  How about we compromise at $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
