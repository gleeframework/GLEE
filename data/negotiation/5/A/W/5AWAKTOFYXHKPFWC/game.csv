"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. However, $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which still represents a substantial value for you. Let's see if we can reach a compromise here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This offers a significant value for you, and it's closer to what the product is truly worth. Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
