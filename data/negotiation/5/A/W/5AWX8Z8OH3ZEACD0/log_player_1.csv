"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $125.  This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will be enough to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of gradually lowering my price to test Bob's willingness to pay.  $115 is still above my minimum and shows I'm flexible but also serious about maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120.  While I'd prefer to get more, this is the best option at this point."
