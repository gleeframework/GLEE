Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $120, knowing Bob values it at $150, gives him a good incentive to negotiate.  He likely sees a deal to be made. 
* **Maintaining John as a Backup:** I haven't forgotten about John. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $80 sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. 
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $80, I'm not desperate to take Bob's offer.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Exploring Higher Offers:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a significant profit.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, showing that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Positive Framing:**  I highlight the value Bob places on the product to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $95 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $95 is very close to my desired price point and significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try to push for $100, there's a risk Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Minimizing Time and Effort:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price quickly, saving me further negotiation rounds."
