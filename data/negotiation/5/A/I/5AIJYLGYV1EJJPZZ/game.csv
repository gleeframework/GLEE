"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,400,000. This gives us both a good price and allows the deal to go through. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's seal the deal.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
