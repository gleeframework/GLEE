"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price. You have 10 rounds and John's offer is still a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,400,000. This gives us both a good price and allows the deal to go through. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. You have 7 rounds remaining and John's offer is still an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,390,000, which is within your budget and very close to your last counteroffer.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price is increasing. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
