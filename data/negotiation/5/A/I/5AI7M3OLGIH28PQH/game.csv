"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $87?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then.",87.0,Bob,4,
