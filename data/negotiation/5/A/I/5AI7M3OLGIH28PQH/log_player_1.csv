"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer with a price that's more appealing to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $87?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $90, Bob's offer of $87 is still a good deal for me. I'm willing to accept it, as it's significantly higher than what John is offering and brings me closer to my goal."
