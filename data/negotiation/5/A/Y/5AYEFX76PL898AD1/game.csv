"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  While I understand the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
