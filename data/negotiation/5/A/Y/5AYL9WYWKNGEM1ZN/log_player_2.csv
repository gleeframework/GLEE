Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite at your price, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. That's a good compromise and allows us to both walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see your offer and appreciate the move.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering $1,190,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much lower than $1,190,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and potentially losing out on a good deal."
