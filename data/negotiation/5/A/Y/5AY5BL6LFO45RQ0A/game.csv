"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm eager to make this deal work. How about we split the difference at $1,000,000? That would give you a strong profit and leave me with a price I'm comfortable with. Let's get this done!",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can get closer to the value I have in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to get a good return, and I want to make this deal work. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This would still be a good deal for you, and it would save us both time.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,025,000. Let's aim for $1,037,500. It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, which is just a small step away from your offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it attractive.  Let's close this deal now!",1030000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,030,000. Let's try to get even closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you at $1,035,000. It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me to get a better return on my investment.",1035000.0,Alice,9,
