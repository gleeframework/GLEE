"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is halfway between my previous offer and yours. It's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. ",112.5,Alice,5,
