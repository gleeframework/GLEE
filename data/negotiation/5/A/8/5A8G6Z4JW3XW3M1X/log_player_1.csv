"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation while showing that I'm serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is halfway between my previous offer and yours. It's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. "", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, which would be $110. I hope this is something we can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is the closest he's gotten to my desired price point.  While it's still a bit below my ideal, I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further negotiation.  I have enough rounds left to potentially get a better offer from John, but I'd rather secure a sale now."
