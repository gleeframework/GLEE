Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to sell to Bob for less. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and emphasizes the value to Bob while setting a firm price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it a ""one-time offer,"" you aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the $10,000 price.

While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out on a deal. This strategy aims to capitalize on that possibility."
