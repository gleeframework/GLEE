Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I believe you'll find very valuable.  It's worth a significant amount to both of us, at least $1,200,000.  To make this simple, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product's value is $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's worth to both parties emphasizes its value and justifies the high asking price.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and avoids complicated bargaining tactics.
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still gets her minimum desired price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward.  If Bob accepts, Alice gains a $300,000 profit. If not, she can still sell to John at her baseline price."
