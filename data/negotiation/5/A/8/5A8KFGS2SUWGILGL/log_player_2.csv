The offer is way too high for Bob's budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is going to start with a very aggressive counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.  He knows that Alice is willing to sell for $1,500,000, so he's starting at half that price. This is a risky move, but it could pay off if Alice is eager to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for a price higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a good chance she'll come down in price.  Bob is confident that he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob is increasing his offer but still trying to keep it under his maximum price. He believes that Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her bottom line and allows her to make a profit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still close to his maximum budget. While Alice's offer is tempting, he's determined to see if he can get a lower price. He feels like another round of negotiation could get him closer to his goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is making one final push. He knows Alice is close to his maximum budget, so he's increasing his offer one last time. He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's only $100,000 less than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now too close to Bob's maximum budget. Even though he was hoping to negotiate a better price, he's realized that further negotiations are unlikely to yield significant savings.  It's time to take advantage of the guaranteed deal with John."
