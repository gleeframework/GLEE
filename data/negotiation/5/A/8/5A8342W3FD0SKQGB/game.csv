"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
