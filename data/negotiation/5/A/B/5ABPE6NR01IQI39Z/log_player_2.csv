"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum you're willing to pay ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest while also leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Starting Point:**  A $700,000 offer provides a strong starting point for negotiations, allowing for potential compromises that benefit both parties.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message clearly expresses your willingness to purchase the product but emphasizes that the initial price was too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than your counteroffer of $700,000. This indicates that there's still room for negotiation.
* **Improving Your Position:**  By rejecting the offer, you demonstrate your willingness to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting allows you to send a counteroffer that is closer to your ideal price, potentially leading to a compromise closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to me. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target.
* **Fair Compromise:**  The $750,000 offer is a reasonable midpoint between your previous counteroffer of $700,000 and Alice's current offer of $850,000.
* **Positive Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution, fostering a positive and collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $800,000 is closer to your desired price range, and you've already established a pattern of negotiation.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer might lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk that Alice might be unwilling to go lower or might decide to sell to someone else.
* **Potential for Savings:**  While it's not your ideal price, accepting the offer still saves you $700,000 compared to buying from John.

At this point, it's a good time to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing the deal."
