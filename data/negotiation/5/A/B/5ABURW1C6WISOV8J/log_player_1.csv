"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully entices Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,750.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves me a little room to negotiate in case Bob wants to play hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that we can find a middle ground.  We've got plenty of rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round and offer $9,500.  If he rejects this, I'm starting to get concerned about whether I can get a better price, and might have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that we can find a middle ground.  We've got plenty of rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250.  Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but we're nearing the end of the negotiation. I'll be happy with this price, but I want to see if he's willing to budge just a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting risky. I'm starting to believe Bob is just trying to squeeze the best deal for himself.  While I'd love to get $9,000 or more, at this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob.  To be safe, and since I have the option, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
