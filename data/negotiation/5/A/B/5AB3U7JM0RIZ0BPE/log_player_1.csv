Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing you a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
