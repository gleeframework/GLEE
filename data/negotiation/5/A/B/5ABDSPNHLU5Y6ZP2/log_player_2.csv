Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. I've tried to be realistic about the value of this product, and while your offer is tempting, it's still a substantial gap for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep working towards a deal.  I've been very transparent with you about the value I place on this product. To be completely frank, my absolute lowest price is $1,500,000. That's a firm offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely she'll come down further.  At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John for $800,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
