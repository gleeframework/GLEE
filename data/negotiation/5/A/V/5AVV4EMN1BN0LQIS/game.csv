"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we discuss a price closer to $800,000? I hope this suggestion sparks a productive conversation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is far too low for me.  Let's find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, I still believe there might be room for further discussion. How about considering $950,000 for the product? I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory agreement for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's aim for a price that reflects the value of this product. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction quickly. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
