{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its high quality and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price point, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  By offering a price that's closer to your minimum than his maximum, I am hoping to encourage a quick acceptance or at least prompt a counteroffer that we can then negotiate from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

$900,000 is still a good price but I can likely get more. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While your offer is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer to cover the value of the product. I'd be willing to negotiate at $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like a bit more, Bob has met me halfway, and $925,000 is a very good price. It's important to keep the negotiation moving and avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
