You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is above your budget. You can try to negotiate with Alice."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position,  leaving room for negotiation while still staying within my budget."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000, which is closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while keeping my financial goals in mind."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is now at my budget limit. Since I can buy the same product from John for the same price, it makes sense to go with John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price."
