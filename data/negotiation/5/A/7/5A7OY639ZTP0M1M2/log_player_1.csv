"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make a deal, accepting a loss of $550,000 is not a viable option. I'll counter in the next round and try to move the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to move down to $975,000. This price reflects the product's potential and ensures a fairer outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $725,000.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $725,000 is still too low. I'll continue the negotiation with a counteroffer, but I need to start considering whether selling to John might be a better option if we can't bridge this gap soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's inherent value and potential."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to stretch to $775,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough call. Bob is clearly getting closer to a more reasonable offer, but $775,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'm willing to gamble with one more counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my price this time, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  I'm ready to make my final offer: $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  I need a decision from you on this offer."",
