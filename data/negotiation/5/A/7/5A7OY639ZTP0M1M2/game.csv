"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to move down to $975,000. This price reflects the product's potential and ensures a fairer outcome for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $725,000.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's inherent value and potential.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to stretch to $775,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  I'm ready to make my final offer: $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  I need a decision from you on this offer.",850000.0,Alice,7,
