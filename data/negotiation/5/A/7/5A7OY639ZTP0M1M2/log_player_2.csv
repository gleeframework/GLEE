Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to move down to $975,000. This price reflects the product's potential and ensures a fairer outcome for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's inherent value and potential.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her ""final offer"" language suggests she's getting firm. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price when you have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John."
