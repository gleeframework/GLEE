"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, at $200. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll lower my price a bit, but I'm confident that the product is worth more to me than $80, so I'm not going to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $80, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $180.  This is still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise considering Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a little bit more.  I'm going to counter again and see if we can finally strike a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm confident this is the final price I'm willing to go down to. I think it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $150. While I'd love to get $160 from Bob, we've been at a stalemate for a few rounds now. Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price from him."
