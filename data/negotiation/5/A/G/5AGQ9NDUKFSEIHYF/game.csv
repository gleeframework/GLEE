,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $115.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to purchase the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $115, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to offer $120, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
