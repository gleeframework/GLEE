"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it represents a great opportunity for you to acquire it.  Consider it carefully, as I'm also in talks with another potential buyer.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a price that reflects both our needs. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move on to other opportunities.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
