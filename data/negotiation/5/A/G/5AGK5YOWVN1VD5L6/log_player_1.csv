Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than selling to John, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a low price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept a price significantly below what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000. I'll accept his offer and conclude the negotiation."
