"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $110? This would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",108.0,Bob,6,
