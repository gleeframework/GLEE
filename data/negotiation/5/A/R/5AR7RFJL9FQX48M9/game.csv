"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
