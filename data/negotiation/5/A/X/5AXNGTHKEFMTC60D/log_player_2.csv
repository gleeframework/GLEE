"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. We believe it's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100. You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for negotiation!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can make this deal more attractive for both of us. How about I offer the product for $95? It's still a good deal, but closer to what you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $95, which is a good price for you. It's still below your maximum price of $120 and a good deal considering Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80."
