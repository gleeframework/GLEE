"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify paying around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need to get. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the market value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $8,000 for this round.  This is a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to reach an agreement this time.",8000.0,Alice,5,
