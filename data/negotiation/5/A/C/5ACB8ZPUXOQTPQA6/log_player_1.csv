Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, aiming for a price slightly below that with Bob might yield a higher profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,190,000 is a substantial markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still potentially attractive compared to losing the opportunity. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies that Bob has a limited window to purchase before the product is offered to John, encouraging a quicker decision.

**Important:** This is a single offer in a larger negotiation.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has room to lower the price slightly to try and secure a deal before going to John."
