"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm interested in exploring other options. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and the return on investment you can expect.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and recognizes the value you see in the product.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be upfront â€“  $1,700,000 simply isn't feasible for me given the value this product represents. I'm open to finding a solution, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm afraid $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to reiterate my previous counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
