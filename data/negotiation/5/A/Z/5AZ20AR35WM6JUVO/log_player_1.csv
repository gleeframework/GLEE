``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation room while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good tactic to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it gives us both room to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my value.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
