"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Bob,4,
