"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is outside of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  This would give you a decent profit while staying within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is still a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $13500 is still too much for me.  Let's try $10000.  It's a big step from my last offer, and if we can reach an agreement, we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so you'll need to decide if it's worth it to you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
