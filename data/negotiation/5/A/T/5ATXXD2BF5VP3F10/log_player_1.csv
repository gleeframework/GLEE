Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling and willing to compromise slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price of $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,500.  While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher offer, but it also risks Bob walking away or me losing valuable time.  At this point, selling to Bob is the most practical decision."
