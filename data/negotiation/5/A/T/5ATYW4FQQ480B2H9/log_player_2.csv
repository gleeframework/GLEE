It's far too expensive for me right now. I need to see if we can get closer to my budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

``` 

While I'd prefer to get it for closer to $8,500, $9,500 is still within my budget and closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John."
