"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your openness to discussion. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $13,500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, due to my financial constraints, I am still unable to meet the price of $12,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $11,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,4,
