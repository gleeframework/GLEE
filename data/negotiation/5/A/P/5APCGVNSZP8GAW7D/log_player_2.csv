{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget:**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000. Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high.
* **John is your backup:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John, who will sell you the product for your maximum price of $15,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or securing the product from John at your preferred price."
