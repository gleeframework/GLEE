"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $862,500 is simply not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. Let's try $900,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.
