{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value of $800,000 but below my minimum of $1,200,000.  It gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it might incentivize him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  John is always an option if this negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $925,000, so I'll offer $862,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$862,500 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise closer to my minimum.  I'm still confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us, and John is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $862,500 is simply not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. Let's try $900,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $885,000 is still too far below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob, at least I'll be able to meet my minimum goal."
