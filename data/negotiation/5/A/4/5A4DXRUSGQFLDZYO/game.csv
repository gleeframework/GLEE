"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,500 is a bit out of my budget. Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is already a competitive price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
