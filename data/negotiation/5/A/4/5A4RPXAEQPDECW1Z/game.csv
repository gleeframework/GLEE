"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $20,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to meet the price of $17,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $14,000 for the product. I hope this might be within your consideration.",14000.0,Bob,4,
