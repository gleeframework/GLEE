"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you considerable benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm prepared to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering both our needs.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. Would you consider $975,000? I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $925,000, which is a significant compromise on my part and brings us closer to a deal.  I believe this offer is a good midpoint for us to agree on.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $937,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good midpoint for us to agree on. Let's close this deal.",937500.0,Bob,8,
