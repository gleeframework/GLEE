"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is simply too high for me. Given my research, and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This offer is fair, reflects the product's value, and allows us to both come to an agreeable conclusion.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and scarcity of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this adjustment demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,950,000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges both the value and the need for compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
