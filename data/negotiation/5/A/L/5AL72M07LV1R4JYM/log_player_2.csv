"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it. Would you be willing to pay $9,500 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller offering a better deal.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer allows for more exploration."
