"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's my absolute top limit."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000**, which is still lower than what John is offering ($12,000). 
* **Bob wants to save as much money as possible**, but at this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal. 
* **Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase for a price lower than John's**."
