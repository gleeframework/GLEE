Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob.  How about we settle at $102? That's a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
 
Alice is clearly willing to bargain down, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $102.  It's a reasonable price and saves you a decent amount compared to John."
