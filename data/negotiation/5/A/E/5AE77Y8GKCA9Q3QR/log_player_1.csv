Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but $1,800,000 is simply not within a reasonable range for me. This product has value, but I'm looking at something closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we try $1,100,000? This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it shows how committed I am to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need you to understand where I'm coming from as well. $1,300,000 is just too big of a gap from what I'm willing to pay. If you can't do better than that, I'm afraid I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. To show you I'm still very interested, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a substantial commitment from my end, and I hope you can see it as a path forward for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. He's using John's offer as leverage, and while he might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
