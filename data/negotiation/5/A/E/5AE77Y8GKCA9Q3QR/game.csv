"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but $1,800,000 is simply not within a reasonable range for me. This product has value, but I'm looking at something closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we try $1,100,000? This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it shows how committed I am to getting this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I respect that. Let's close this gap. How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my margin but recognizes our desire to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need you to understand where I'm coming from as well. $1,300,000 is just too big of a gap from what I'm willing to pay. If you can't do better than that, I'm afraid I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. To show you I'm still very interested, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a substantial commitment from my end, and I hope you can see it as a path forward for us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
