"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is upbeat and emphasizes the value Bob gets from the deal.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have the advantage of knowing John is willing to pay $10,000, which gives me a safety net. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:** I can use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is still fair for both of us, focusing on shared benefit.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly suggesting that this might be my last offer, increasing the pressure for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:** $12,500 is closer to my desired price point than John's offer of $10,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  While not ideal, it's a good compromise that reflects a willingness to work with Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds left, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of a further negotiation."
