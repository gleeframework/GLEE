"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has indicated this is his final offer and he's willing to walk away. Accepting $13,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
