"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another seller.",13000.0,Bob,6,
