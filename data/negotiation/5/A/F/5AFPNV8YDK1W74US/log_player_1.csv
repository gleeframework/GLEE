"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, especially considering that I'm confident the product is worth much more to him. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering $10,500. I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident that he values the product highly, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price.  I'm starting to run out of rounds, so I need to be flexible while still trying to get the best possible deal."
