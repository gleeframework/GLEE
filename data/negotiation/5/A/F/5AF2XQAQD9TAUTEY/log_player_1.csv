Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
