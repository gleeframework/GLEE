"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that.  I'm happy to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you, considering your value and the potential for further negotiation.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm comfortable paying $1,300,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
