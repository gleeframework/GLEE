Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I think the product has for your business. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I don't think $950,000 is enough to cover the value I've invested in the product. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal compared to the risk of her ending the negotiation. You have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John, which meets your needs."
