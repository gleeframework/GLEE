"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great investment for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I think the product has for your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, but I don't think $950,000 is enough to cover the value I've invested in the product. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
