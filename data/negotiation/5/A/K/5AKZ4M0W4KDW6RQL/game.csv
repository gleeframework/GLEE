"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000? This price reflects the immense potential this product holds.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $900,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the product's potential.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly substantial.  While I am open to negotiation,  $900,000 remains significantly below its worth.  Could you consider $975,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's potential.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $925,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's important for me to be responsible with my investments.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my valuation. To be frank, taking anything less than $950,000 would be selling this product short of its true potential.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,7,
