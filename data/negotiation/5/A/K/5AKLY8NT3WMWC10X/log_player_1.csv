"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not aiming for the full $10,000 immediately as this could lead to immediate rejection.
* **Safeguarding my minimum:**  The offer is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I'm not losing out on potential profit. 

This strategy aims to open the negotiation in a way that is both attractive to Bob and allows for potential further negotiation without risking a quick end to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my starting point:**  While it's above my minimum, it's still below the price I initially offered, showing that there's room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Weighing the risks:** Selling to John now guarantees a safe $8,000, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, given his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  This price remains above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it represents a significant increase from his previous offer and is approaching my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:** With only six rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to sell to John for $8,000 increases.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit above my minimum, reducing the uncertainty and potential loss. 

In this scenario, the risk of further negotiation not leading to a better outcome outweighs the potential for a higher price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a reasonable profit."
