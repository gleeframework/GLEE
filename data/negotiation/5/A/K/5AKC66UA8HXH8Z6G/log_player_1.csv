Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Targeting Above Our Minimum:**  We want to maximize our profit, so aiming for a price significantly above our $800,000 minimum is key.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $1,000,000. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring we don't lose money.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
