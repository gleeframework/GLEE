Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we both get something we're happy with."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his last offer of $85 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already reached my limit on compromising, and John is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
