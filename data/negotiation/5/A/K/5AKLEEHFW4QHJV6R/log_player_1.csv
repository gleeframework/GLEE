Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe you'll find it worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **High but Negotiable:** Starting at $14,999 sets a strong anchor price while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value-Oriented Message:**  The message subtly implies the value of the product might exceed the price while encouraging Bob to engage in discussion. 

This strategy aims to first see if a deal exceeding your safety net is achievable before settling for the guaranteed $15,000."
