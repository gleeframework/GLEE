"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can we compromise on that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go lower.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
