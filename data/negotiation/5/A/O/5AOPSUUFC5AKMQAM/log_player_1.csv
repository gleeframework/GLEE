Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I think there's room for a higher counteroffer. I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product above $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I'd like, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds and I'm starting to feel the pressure. $12,800 is a decent profit and I'm not sure how much higher I can push Bob.  I'm worried he might walk away entirely and then I'll have to sell to John for $10,000.  It's time to lock in the deal."
