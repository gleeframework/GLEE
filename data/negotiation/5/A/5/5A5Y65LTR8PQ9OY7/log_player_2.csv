"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than $1,500,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer at $1,350,000 is the best option for Bob in this situation. He gets the product for a price he's comfortable with, and it's likely he won't be able to get a significantly lower price through further negotiation."
