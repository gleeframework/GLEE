"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the initial offer and John's price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that continuing negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's also possible Alice might not budge further, leading to a loss of time and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
