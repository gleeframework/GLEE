Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer it to you for $10,550. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,550.  You're running the risk of the price going above your $10,000 limit if you continue to negotiate. John offers a sure thing at your target price.  It's time to cut bait with Alice and secure the deal with John."
