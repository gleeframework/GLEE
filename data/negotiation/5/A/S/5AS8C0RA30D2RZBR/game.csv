"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,400,000 is closer to its value, I'm aiming for a higher return on this asset.  How about we settle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a higher return, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,520,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
