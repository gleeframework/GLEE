"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $122. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum price and shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $120.  It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob, so it's best to secure the deal with John and guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
