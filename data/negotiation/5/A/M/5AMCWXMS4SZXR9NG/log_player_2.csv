Round 5

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $80, and this price is close enough to my goal. It's a good balance between getting a deal and not risking losing the product to John's offer."
