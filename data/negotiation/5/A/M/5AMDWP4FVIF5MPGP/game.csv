"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,800 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,900. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm firm on that price. It's a fair compromise, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $11,000 is a bit too high. I'll meet you at $10,950, and that's my final offer. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is getting tricky, but I'm still not able to go lower than $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm genuinely interested in selling to you, but if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
