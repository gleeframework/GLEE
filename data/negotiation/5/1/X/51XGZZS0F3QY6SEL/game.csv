"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to purchase the product from you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
