{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price, as it's what the product is worth to me. It's possible Bob will accept, and if not, I can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but I'm looking for a price closer to $120. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $140? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $120. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $135 is a decent compromise and a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price and the negotiation seems to be getting closer to a conclusion."
