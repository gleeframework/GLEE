Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,500. Can you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price if I keep negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
