"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's a chance to negotiate a better deal."
