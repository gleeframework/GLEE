"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also considering that I have the option of selling to John for $8,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's shown interest by making a counteroffer. I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,500.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $8,500 is still a good price and above my minimum."
