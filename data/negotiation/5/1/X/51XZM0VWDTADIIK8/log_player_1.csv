"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high initial price, even though I haven't provided specifics. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I always have the John option ($1,500,000),  I want to see if Bob is willing to go significantly higher than his perceived value in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, however, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's $1,500,000, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests budget constraints, but I'll counter with a strong offer to test how firm those constraints are."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While we're not quite aligned yet, I see the potential for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** I've reduced my price by $400,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying well above both Bob's offer and John's standing offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm continuing to subtly reinforce the high value of the product, hoping to nudge Bob's perception closer to my own.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a clearer understanding of Bob's negotiation range. If he's willing to go significantly higher than $1,400,000, there's a good chance we can reach a deal well above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, and $1,600,000 is tempting. However, I'm willing to risk another round.  He increased his offer by $200,000, showing serious interest. I believe there's still a chance to secure a deal closer to $1,700,000 with careful negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here.  I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down $150,000 from my last offer, meeting Bob more than halfway.  This signals a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Firm but Fair:**  $1,750,000 is a strong price, well above John's offer. It leaves Bob with a significant gain compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this as my final compromise, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept before I reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in lowering the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1,650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and Bob has steadily increased his offer.  This indicates he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 
* **Time Value:** While I believe I could potentially squeeze a little more out of the deal, the remaining rounds are dwindling.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - $1,650,000 is a significant gain, and it eliminates the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Above John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a $150,000 profit compared to selling to John. 
 
It's time to close the deal."
