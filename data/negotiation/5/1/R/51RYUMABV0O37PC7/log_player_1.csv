Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) than your minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Confidence:** The message implies the product's value, making Bob less likely to drastically lowball a counter-offer.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to make more than selling to John for $10,000."
