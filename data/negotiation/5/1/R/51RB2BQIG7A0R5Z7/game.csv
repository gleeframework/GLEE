"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $850,000?  That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's valuable. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to buy it immediately.",900000.0,Bob,4,
