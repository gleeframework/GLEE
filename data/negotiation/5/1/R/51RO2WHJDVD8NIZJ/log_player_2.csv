"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents the offer enthusiastically, her price of $12,000 matches the maximum you're willing to pay *and* the price John offers.  You gain no advantage from accepting Alice's offer. Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price without needing to negotiate further."
