"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my offer, but I'm confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still aiming for more. I have 8 rounds left and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer, and I'm confident I can close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 6 rounds left, but I don't want to risk Bob changing his mind or me not being able to reach a better price.  I'll accept his offer and secure a decent profit."
