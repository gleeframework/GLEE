Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to me (Alice), the message hints at its value, making the asking price seem more reasonable. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, it subtly implies Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a good chance he'll counter with a price higher than $8,000, which is still a win for Alice."
