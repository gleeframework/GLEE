"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to consider your interest. My initial offer is $950000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John as a last resort."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $750000, which would be $850000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to bring the price down further before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $860000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $860,000 is a bit closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room to negotiate. Bob can try to counter with a slightly higher offer, aiming for a price in the low $800,000s, before considering buying from John as a last resort."
