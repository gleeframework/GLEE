"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, as I want to maximize my profit. It also sets the tone for a potentially challenging negotiation. Since I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, I have some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I am aiming for a higher price. I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, and we can close the deal before I need to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue. Accepting his offer ensures a profit, and I can always try to negotiate a better deal with future buyers."
