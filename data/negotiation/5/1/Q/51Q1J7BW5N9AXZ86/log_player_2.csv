"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  This price also allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best strategy to save money."
