Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Safeguard:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice shouldn't offer anything below this price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a potential win-win situation. Bob saves $2,000 compared to finding a similar product elsewhere, and Alice makes a profit of $2,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly introduces a sense of urgency and the possibility of missing out, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
