"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $9500. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
