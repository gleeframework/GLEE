"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to buy the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the savings I'm offering you.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to negotiate, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
