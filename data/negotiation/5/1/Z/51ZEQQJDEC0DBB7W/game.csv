"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $600,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a good price for you, considering the value it brings. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 simply isn't enough for me to consider.  Let's split the difference. How about $850,000? This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can still meet my goals.  Let's get this done!",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $775,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $775,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",825000.0,Alice,7,
