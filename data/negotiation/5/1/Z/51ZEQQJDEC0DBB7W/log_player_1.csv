Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction at this point. There's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $600,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.

Round 4
