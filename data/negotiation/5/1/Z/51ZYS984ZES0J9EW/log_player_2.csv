"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a good profit for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you're saving $30 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is acceptable:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is within that range. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save some money."
