"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I can offer it to you for $16,000.  This price reflects the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $16,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $13,500? I think that's a fair offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250?  This price acknowledges the value of the product and is within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  To be honest,  $14,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to work with me.  I'm very close to accepting, but $14,500 would be a much more agreeable price point for me.  I'm confident that at this price, we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
