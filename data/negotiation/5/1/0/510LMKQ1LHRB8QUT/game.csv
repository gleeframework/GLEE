"Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,1,
