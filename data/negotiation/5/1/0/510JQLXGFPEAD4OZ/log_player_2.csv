# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. Considering our previous discussion and the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1150000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being closer to your desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good deal for you.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or you might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation."
