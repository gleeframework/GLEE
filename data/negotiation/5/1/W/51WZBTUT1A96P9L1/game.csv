"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm not able to go below $1,125,000.  This still represents a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
