"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is a good deal, especially considering the risk of losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
