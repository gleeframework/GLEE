"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000.  It's worth a lot to you, and I think this price reflects that value while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best deal possible. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make another counteroffer in the hope of finding a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
