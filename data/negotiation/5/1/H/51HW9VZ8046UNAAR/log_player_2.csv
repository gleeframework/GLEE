"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $140. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a reasonable cost, considering its value to you is $150. I believe this offer presents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make you think the product is worth $150 to you, you know your maximum value is less.  However, her offer of $140 is still better than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you $10."
