"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents the high-end value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
