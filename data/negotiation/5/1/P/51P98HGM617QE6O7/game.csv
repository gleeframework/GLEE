"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go given my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's try to find a compromise here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's worth to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
