"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to me is $10000. I'm looking to make a fair deal, but I also need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12000. If you're still interested, let me know.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10200 and my last offer of $9500. I'll pay $9850 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",9850.0,Bob,6,
