"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price still allows for a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
