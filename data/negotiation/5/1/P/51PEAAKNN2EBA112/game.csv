"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can't afford to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this still reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to come down further, I'll have to look at other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
