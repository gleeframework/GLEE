"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a high opening offer, leaving room for negotiation. It acknowledges the value Bob places on the product, but also sets a clear expectation that you are aiming for a significant profit.  This strategy allows for potential concessions while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I am aiming for a significantly higher profit than $875,000. I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer meets Bob's latest offer halfway. It shows a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a price point that is beneficial to me.  This also increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but there is still a significant gap between his offer and my desired profit.  With only four rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of not reaching a deal with either buyer is increasing. Selling to John now guarantees me a decent profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
