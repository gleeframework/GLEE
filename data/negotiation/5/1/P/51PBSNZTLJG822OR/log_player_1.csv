Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $900,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's willing to pay a decent amount, he's still not coming close to my minimum price.  I've also gone through all my counteroffers, and I don't see the situation changing significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
