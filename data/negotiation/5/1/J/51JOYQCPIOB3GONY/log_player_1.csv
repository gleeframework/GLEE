Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he'll still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can still potentially negotiate a price closer to your ideal.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
