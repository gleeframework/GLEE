"I'm very interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my new offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $890000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm starting to think that if we can't meet at this price, I might need to explore other options. Can you consider my new offer?",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $890000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $897000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $890000, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",897000.0,Alice,7,
