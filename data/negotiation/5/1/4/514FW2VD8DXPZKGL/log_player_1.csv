Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95?  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $85.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $85 is still below my minimum value, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90}
