"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's not even worth considering. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $10,000, I'm offering the lowest price possible. I know Alice wants to sell the product, so there's a chance she might accept. If she rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I can potentially make a counteroffer closer to Alice's offer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $16,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $14,500 is still too high.  I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of reaching a price closer to my budget or consider buying from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $13,000. This is a compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still within my acceptable range. This shows I'm willing to pay more but not over my limit. If Alice rejects, I might consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping to negotiate a lower price, and if Alice doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer.  I'm not quite ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $13,500. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still keeping the price within my budget. If Alice rejects, I'm prepared to buy from John, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,750 is still higher than I initially hoped for, it's getting very close to my budget.  I'm not sure if Alice will budge further, and there's only one round left before I have to make a decision. Buying from John for $10,000 would be ideal, but I might regret not getting this product if I miss this opportunity.  I'll accept Alice's offer and secure the product, knowing I saved $1,250 compared to the initial price she offered."
