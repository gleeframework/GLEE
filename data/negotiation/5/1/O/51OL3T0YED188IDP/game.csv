"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can close this quickly.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,025,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still not quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about $1,020,000? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",1020000.0,Alice,7,
