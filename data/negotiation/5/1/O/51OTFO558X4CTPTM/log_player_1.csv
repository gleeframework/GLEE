Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still within range of my target price and believe I can get a slightly higher offer from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

While $880,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $880,000 is still a bit too low.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $895,000 as a final compromise. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 895000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $885,000. Can we meet at this price?

While $885,000 is tempting, with only two rounds left I'm concerned I won't be able to get a higher offer from Bob.  It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee myself $800,000."
