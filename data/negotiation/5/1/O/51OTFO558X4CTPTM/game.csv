,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $880,000 is still a bit too low.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $895,000 as a final compromise. Let's make this happen.",895000.0,Alice,7,
