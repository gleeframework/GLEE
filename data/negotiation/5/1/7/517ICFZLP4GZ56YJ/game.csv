,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal!",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",95.0,Bob,6,
