Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting with $200 is a good starting point, as it allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open ended:** The question ""What do you think?""  invites Bob to respond, potentially starting a negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting offer.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your assessment of how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  The knowledge that you can sell to John for $150 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $150.  Consider how determined Bob seems to be and adjust your counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $175 is a compromise between your minimum price of $150 and Bob's offer of $120.
* **Highlight value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider your price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The tone remains friendly, suggesting a willingness to reach an agreement. 

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate.  Pay attention to his response and be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $175 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets your minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is exactly your minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gains:**  There is no incentive to reject his offer and risk further negotiation.  You are unlikely to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate might delay the sale, potentially affecting your overall profit.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient way to secure a sale that meets your minimum requirement. You can then move on to other potential deals or focus on other tasks."
