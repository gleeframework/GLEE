Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $1,325,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a fair price. However, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price than his current offer.  We're not desperate to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this gap. How about $1,350,000 and we have a deal?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $1,320,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and consistently inching upwards. While there might be a slight bit more room, accepting at $1,320,000 secures a strong profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far.  It's a good deal at this point."
