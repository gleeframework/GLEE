{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential for significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit.
* **Backup Offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, giving her leverage. She doesn't need to desperately lowball the price."
