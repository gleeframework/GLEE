Alice is getting closer, but you're still within your budget and can try to squeeze out a little more. Keep pushing for a lower price, but be mindful of the dwindling rounds. John is still a safe alternative if the negotiations stall."

It's getting down to the wire, and while Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what John is offering. With only one round left, the risk of not getting a better deal from Alice is too high. Buying from John guarantees the best price within your budget."
