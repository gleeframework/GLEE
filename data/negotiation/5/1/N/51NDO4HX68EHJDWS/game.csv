"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, but is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,750 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's aim for $10,600. This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm hopeful we can agree on this.",10600.0,Bob,6,
