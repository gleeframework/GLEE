"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $7,500 at this time. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product right now.",8000.0,Bob,4,
