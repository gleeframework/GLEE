"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2000000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1200000. This is a fair price that respects both our needs.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1200000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and should be within your budget. Let's seal the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1400000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there!  $1300000 is very close to my price point, but I need to make sure this deal is mutually beneficial. How about $1350000? It's a small compromise on my end and a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm ready to finalize this deal at $1325000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this transaction. Let's make this happen!",1325000.0,Bob,8,
