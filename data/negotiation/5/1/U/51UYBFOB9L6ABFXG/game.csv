"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",17500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,500 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,250. How about $13,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but $13,750 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This is really my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
