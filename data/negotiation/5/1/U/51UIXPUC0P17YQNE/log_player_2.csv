# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering he can buy the same product from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John. While there is still potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away from the deal is high.  It's better to secure the product at this price than to continue negotiating and potentially lose the deal altogether."
