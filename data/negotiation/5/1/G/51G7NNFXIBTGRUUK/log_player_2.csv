Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach your limit, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $820,000, and it's clear she's holding firm.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in further negotiations."
