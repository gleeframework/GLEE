Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty stuck on a price well above your target. She went up in her counteroffer, indicating she's not very motivated to meet your needs. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice for a potentially small gain."
