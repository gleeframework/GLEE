Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:**  I need at least $1,200,000 to be happy with the sale.
* **Potential for more:** There's a chance Bob values the product more than John, so I'm aiming higher than John's offer. 
* **Balancing risk:**  $1,500,000 is a significant markup but  still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.

This strategy balances the need for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
