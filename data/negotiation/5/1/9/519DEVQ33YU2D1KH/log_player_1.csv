Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell the product at your minimum acceptable price."
