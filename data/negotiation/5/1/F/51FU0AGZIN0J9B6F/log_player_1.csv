"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get a good starting point. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to me, hoping it will convince him to pay a higher price.  

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the product's value to both of us.  Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,000,000, and also exceeds what I could get from John.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
