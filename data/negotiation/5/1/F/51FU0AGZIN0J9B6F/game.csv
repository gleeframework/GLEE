"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the product's value to both of us.  Let's meet halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
