"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9500, but I can only go up to $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9000, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000. Can we meet at this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
