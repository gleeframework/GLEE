Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I've done extensive research and analysis on its value, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest in the product.
