"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above market value and reflects the potential I see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I've done extensive research and analysis on its value, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest in the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
