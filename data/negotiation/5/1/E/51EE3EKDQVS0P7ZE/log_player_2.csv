"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  You can reject this offer and see if she counters with a better price."
