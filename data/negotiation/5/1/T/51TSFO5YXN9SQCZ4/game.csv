"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $14000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
