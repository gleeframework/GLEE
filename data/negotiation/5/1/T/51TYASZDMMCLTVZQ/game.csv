"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident it's a good investment.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's potential.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and long-term returns this product can offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm looking for a price point closer to $2,000,000. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,625,000. This price takes into account the product's value and potential returns, while also being mindful of my budget.",1625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,690,000?  That's a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.",1690000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I think we can do even better. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
