"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, it's still above his ideal price point. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He starts by making a significant counteroffer, $50,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if necessary.  The $900,000 price is still within his budget, and he can afford to go lower if needed in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob can likely get a better price with continued negotiation. He has 7 rounds remaining and can still potentially secure a deal closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually decreasing the price. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, but still remains below Alice's offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but is also serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point, and he still has several rounds left to negotiate.  It's better for Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  At this point, buying from John is not a good option as it's still more expensive than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again raising his offer, but by a smaller increment this time.  He is showing Alice that he is flexible and willing to meet her halfway, but still wants to secure a price below $950,000. He has only 4 rounds left, so needs to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob has 3 rounds left, and he's been able to push her price down.  He's only $50,000 away from his desired price, and it's possible he can get her to agree in the next few rounds.  Buying from John at this point is still more expensive, so it's not a good option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a significant counteroffer, raising his price to almost the middle point between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This signals to Alice that he is serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  With only 2 rounds left, this move puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's only $5,000 lower than her previous offer, which means she isn't willing to budge much. This is the final round, and there's not enough time to negotiate a better price. While buying from John is not ideal, it's the best option available to Bob. He can secure the product within his budget and avoid a potentially drawn-out negotiation."
