"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50? I'm willing to go a little lower than my initial offer to make this work."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can't get much more from him.  It's better to take the $130 now than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's $120 offer."
