"Alice, while your offer is tempting, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still represents a significant gain for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",980000.0,Bob,4,
