"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we discuss this further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,000,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
