I've had a few rounds of negotiations with Bob, but we're still far apart on the price. I'm worried that we won't be able to reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up, and I'm not comfortable selling for much less than my target. 

Instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This will ensure I get the price I'm looking for and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
