"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1050000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. Let's meet halfway.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still too low. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1175000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
