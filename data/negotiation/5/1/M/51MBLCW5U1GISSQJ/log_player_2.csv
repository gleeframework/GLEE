{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to establish a lower price range early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $600,000 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I believe this will be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer, and might lead to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still high on the price.  I'm not willing to accept $650,000, so I'll try another counteroffer.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on this one.  $600,000 is a compromise from both our previous positions, and I think it's a fair offer.  We're getting close to a deal and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is inching back up towards her original asking price.  While $700,000 is still within my budget, I believe we can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a lower price if I keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 625000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still staying below Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not willing to cave completely. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Alice to accept, or at least come down in price a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached the final round, and it's clear that Alice is not budging much on her price.  While $725,000 is within my budget, it's still too high.  It's better to cut my losses and go with John's offer at $1,500,000. I've tried my best to negotiate, but sometimes it's better to walk away than to overpay."
