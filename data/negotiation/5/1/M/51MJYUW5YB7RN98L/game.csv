"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make an offer of $900000 for the product.

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I have to decline. I've done my research, and I believe the product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the market value. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1005000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1005000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1005000 is enough to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to the top of my price range. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1050000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1040000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1040000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already given you a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1075000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need you to meet me at my minimum price. The offer stands: $1075000.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
