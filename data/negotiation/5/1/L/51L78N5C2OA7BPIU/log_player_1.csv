{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still allows me to make a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I've used a friendly but firm tone, highlighting the value the product offers to Bob.  

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation space:** This price leaves room for negotiation, ensuring that Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer. 
* **Motivating Bob:**  The price is attractive enough that Bob may be tempted to accept, especially if he truly values the product.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can always go to John, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum desired price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000 and far below the $1,000,000 I initially offered.  Accepting this offer would mean a major loss for me. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value the product provides and is still a good deal for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a more reasonable price for me while still leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate, emphasizing the value the product offers Bob and suggesting a collaborative approach. This helps maintain a positive rapport while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price.

**Why this approach?**

* **Finding common ground:** This offer shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Building on value:** By mentioning the value the product provides, I'm reminding Bob of the benefits he stands to gain, which may make him more willing to come up in price.
* **Maintaining optionality:** I'm still open to selling to John for $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept Bob's offer if it's not satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a solution.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $800,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's current offer of $750,000. This shows a genuine willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise, but also restating that his offer is still too low. I'm highlighting the fairness of my offer, emphasizing the mutually beneficial nature of this price.
* **Closing with a question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Why this approach?**

* **Compromise and fairness:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm position. It presents a solution that's potentially acceptable to both parties.
* **Building pressure:** By emphasizing the fairness of the offer, I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept. If he rejects, he'll need to offer a higher price or risk losing out.
* **Remaining open:**  I'm still open to selling to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum desired price."
