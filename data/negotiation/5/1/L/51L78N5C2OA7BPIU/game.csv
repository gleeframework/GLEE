"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value the product provides and is still a good deal for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a solution.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
