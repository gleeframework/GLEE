It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $12,000 is a good price, but you might be able to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to spark a discussion."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

``` 
$11,500 is still a good price, but I'm going to try for a little lower. It seems like Alice is willing to negotiate, so I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice is getting closer to my budget.  $11,250 is a good deal and I don't want to risk her walking away or me losing out to John."
