Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $900,000. Since this is still below my minimum price of $800,000, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll wait to see how Bob responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $800,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $920,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
