"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice. You have nothing to lose by trying, as you can always fall back to buying from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $900,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it allows for potential compromise without being too aggressive.  I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway, but if she's not, I'm prepared to keep negotiating or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $920,000 is a good price.  It's still a significant saving compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
