"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Let's split the difference and try $8,750. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $8,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $8,900.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",8900.0,Alice,5,
