"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $150, and you want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product, but you'll pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $110 is still above your ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already successfully lowered the price, and there's time for another round of counteroffers. 
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** It's good to have that backup, but you're trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100, and I'm willing to go to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at 107.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** It's below your maximum of $150 and is close to your desired price point.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** While you could try to squeeze out another few dollars, there's a chance Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **This offer is a good compromise.** It's a fair price for both parties, considering the product's value to you and Alice."
