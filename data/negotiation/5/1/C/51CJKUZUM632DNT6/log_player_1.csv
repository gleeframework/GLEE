Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I think it would be worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $125.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a fallback offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product at $125, you are:

* **Leaving money on the table for Bob:** This makes the deal attractive to him, as he's getting a perceived discount.
* **Maximizing your profit:** You're getting $25 more than your minimum acceptable price and ensuring you don't have to go with John's lower offer."
