"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that number.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can reach an agreement at that price, we can finalize the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
