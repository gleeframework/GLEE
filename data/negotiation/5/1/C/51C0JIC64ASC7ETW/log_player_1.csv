Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for Price:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value tailored to Bob (""your business acumen"") might make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, should he choose to do so.  

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
