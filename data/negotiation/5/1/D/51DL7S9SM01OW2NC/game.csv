"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is quite a bit higher than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but that's the maximum I can offer. Can you meet me at that price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
