"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $130 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
