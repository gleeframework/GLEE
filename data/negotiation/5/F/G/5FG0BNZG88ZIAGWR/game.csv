"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is my absolute ceiling for this product.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $1100000.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1100000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $1150000. This is my best offer at this time, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
