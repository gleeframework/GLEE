"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, her initial offer is much lower. This indicates she's willing to negotiate, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is my absolute ceiling for this product.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $1,100,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1100000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $1150000. This is my best offer at this time, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already negotiated the price down from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying the full $1,200,000 to John. It's better to secure a good deal at $1,150,000 than risk losing the deal altogether."
