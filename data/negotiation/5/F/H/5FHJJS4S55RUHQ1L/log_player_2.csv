Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,800. It's a good compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,800.  Since you can buy the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra money."
