"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,800. It's a good compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
