"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you proposing a price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is valuable to me, but I'm trying to stay within a specific budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,500 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value.  To move forward, I could meet you halfway at $9,000. This feels fair considering the benefits you'll gain. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm confident this price would be fair to both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $8,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
