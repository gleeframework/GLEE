"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute limit.  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
