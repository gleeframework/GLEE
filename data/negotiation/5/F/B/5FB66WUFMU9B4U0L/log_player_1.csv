Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will test his willingness to negotiate and gives me room to potentially settle at a price that benefits me more than simply selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly in his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potential lower offers. I'm happy to sell to John for $12,000, which guarantees me my minimum value."
