Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:**  My goal is to maximize profit, so I want to get more than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk Bob might reject my offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher payout.
* **Strategy:** By offering $1,500,000, I'm giving Bob a significant incentive to buy. It's a good starting point, and I can negotiate down if necessary."
