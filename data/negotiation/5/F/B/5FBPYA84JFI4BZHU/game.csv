"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm confident this product can generate much more value than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
