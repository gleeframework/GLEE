"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
