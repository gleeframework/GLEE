"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $8,500.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also giving you a significant discount.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to bargain, but $7,750 is still not quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $8,250. This price would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get good value out of this product. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am trying to get a good deal. How about $8,000 even? That's a fair price and it would let us close this deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
