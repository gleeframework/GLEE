"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's below Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for potential profit.  I'm aiming to get as close to his value as possible while securing a price above my minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially close the deal.  I'm hoping to find a price that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement from his previous one, it's still below my desired target price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price with another counteroffer.  I need to keep negotiating to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to make concessions. I hope that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept my offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to assess if I want to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer.  I'm starting to run out of time, so I'm going to have to be strategic with my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $1,275,000. This offer is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it. If he rejects it, I'll have to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's last offer is still below my target price. I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  To avoid risking a lower price or a potential breakdown in negotiations, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
