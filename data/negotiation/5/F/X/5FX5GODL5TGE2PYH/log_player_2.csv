"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, and going lower is unlikely. Accepting now secures the product for $200,000 less than John's offer."
