"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $100.  This is a good deal, but you can potentially do better by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget of $120, and you have already rejected a lower offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying the full $120 to John. Accepting Alice's offer at $110 is a safe option that saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
