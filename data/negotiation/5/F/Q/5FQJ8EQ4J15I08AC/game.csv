,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $9500 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10000.0,Bob,6,
