"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiating room. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low to be considered. I'll reject it and see if I can get a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $18,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer more, it's above my minimum and it's clear that Bob won't go higher.  It's better to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds where I might end up with less or having to sell to John for $15,000."
