"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $15,000 at the moment. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'm still not able to pay $13,000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
