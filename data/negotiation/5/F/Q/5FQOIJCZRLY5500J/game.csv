"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14500.0,Alice,3,
