"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still lower than John's price:**  $14,500 is better than $15,000. 
* **There's little room for further negotiation:** Bob has already tried to get a lower price, and Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects again, Alice may not come back with another offer. This could lead to him having to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential further negotiation risks."
