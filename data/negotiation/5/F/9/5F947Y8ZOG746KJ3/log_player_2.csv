# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $100. This is an exclusive opportunity to own this valuable item at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is a good deal for Bob. Even though the product is worth $120 to Bob, he can get it for $100, saving him $20. It's better than buying from John for $120."
