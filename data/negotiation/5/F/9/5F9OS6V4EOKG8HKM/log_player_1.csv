Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm offering a price that's significantly higher but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still want to try and get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $13,000 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the negotiation might be going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if that fails I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum and I'm not sure he'll go higher.  To ensure I get a good price and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell to John."
