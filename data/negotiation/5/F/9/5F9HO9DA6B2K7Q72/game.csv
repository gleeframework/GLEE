Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my limit. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. My absolute maximum is $8000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
