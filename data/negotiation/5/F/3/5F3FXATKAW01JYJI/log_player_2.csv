This is a tough one! Alice is playing hardball, but she's clearly willing to negotiate.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, her stating ""$1,290,000 is my final offer"" puts us in a risky position.  There's a good chance she won't budge and we'll end up having to buy from John at the higher price.

Accepting at $1,290,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
