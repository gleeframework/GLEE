{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase my product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,500,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1325000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a good compromise and within a range that I'm comfortable with. Accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiations and potentially a lower price, while also ensuring a sale above my minimum threshold."
