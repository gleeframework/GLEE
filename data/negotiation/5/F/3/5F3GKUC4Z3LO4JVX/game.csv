"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value and potential for generating value for you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique benefits and my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within a reasonable budget.  I can go as high as $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this offer serious thought, and to be completely transparent, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000. That's my bottom line to make this work. I believe this offer represents significant value for you, given your initial interest and the product's potential. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
