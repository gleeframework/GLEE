"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this price is fair considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good deal. I'm also being upfront and clear about my reasoning for this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and  almost reaches my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price.  I still have several rounds left, and there's a chance we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price. Although it's getting closer,  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have several rounds remaining and don't want to settle for a price I'm not happy with.  I believe there is still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,087,500.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's settle this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
