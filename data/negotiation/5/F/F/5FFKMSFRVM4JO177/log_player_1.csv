Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down a bit if Bob counters, while still likely securing a price higher than John's offer."
