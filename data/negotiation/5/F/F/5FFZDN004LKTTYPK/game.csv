"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it.  However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - $142.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to get at least $150 for this product.  I could come down to $150, but that's my final offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
