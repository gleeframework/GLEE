Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $100 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $75? That's my best offer."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? That's as low as I can go.

You have three options:

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has been very slowly lowering her price, but she's unlikely to meet your needs at this rate. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is your maximum price.  Don't risk losing the product entirely by haggling longer with Alice."
