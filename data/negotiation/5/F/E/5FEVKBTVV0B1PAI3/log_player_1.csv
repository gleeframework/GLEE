"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good price. I'm aware that Bob might reject it, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is not acceptable. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum of $15,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still holding out for a little more. I'm hoping that he sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
