{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a starting point for negotiation. While this price is likely too low for Alice to accept, it sets a firm upper limit on Bob's spending and begins the process of negotiating a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price. He also needs to be mindful of the 10 rounds limit. It's possible a counteroffer might lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's price, showing Bob's willingness to compromise while staying within a range he's comfortable with. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to move closer to Bob's desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is the closest she's come to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and leaving him with only the option of buying from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving time and potentially avoiding a less favorable outcome in later rounds."
