"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
