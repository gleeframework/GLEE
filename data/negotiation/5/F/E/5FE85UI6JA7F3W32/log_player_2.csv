"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's asking price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  My message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product.  I want Alice to see me as a serious buyer, even if my initial offer is low.
* **Strategic Aim:**  My goal is to get the price closer to John's offer ($10,000). By starting low, I'm hoping Alice will counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my alternative price.  There's no benefit to going with John at this point, as the prices are the same."
