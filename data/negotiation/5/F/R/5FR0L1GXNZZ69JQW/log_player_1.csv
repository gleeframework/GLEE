Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  While unlikely, offering it slightly below $150 leaves a tiny bit of room if Bob wanted to negotiate up. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.

It's very improbable that Bob will accept any offer above $80, but this strategy ensures Alice gets the maximum possible value for the product."
