Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,900,000. I'm confident it will prove to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a very ambitious offer to Bob. 
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial price can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his thinking.
* **Potential Upside:**  There's a chance, however small, that Bob might accept this high price, especially if he perceives the product as unique or time-sensitive.

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky.  If Bob is turned off by the high price and refuses to negotiate, you lose the opportunity to make a deal with him.  However, with a guaranteed sale to John, the potential reward of securing a much higher price from Bob might be worth the risk."
