Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150.  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little extra to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering with $160. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $145 is getting closer, I'm hesitant to go any lower. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum requirement. To avoid further negotiation and potential risk of a lower price, I'll sell the product to John."
