Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.
