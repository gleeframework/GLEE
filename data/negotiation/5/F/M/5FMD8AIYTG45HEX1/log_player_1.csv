"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm going to start with my ideal price, since it's the value I place on the product.  This way, I have room to negotiate if needed. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to get.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's still above his initial offer, but lower than my original asking price. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I believe I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly. I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  We're approaching the midpoint, so I'm hoping I can convince Bob to raise his offer one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000. I'm hoping that by standing my ground and demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, Bob will finally come up to a price that's closer to what I need.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is close enough to my minimum price.  While I would love to get closer to $1,100,000,  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. There's a good chance that Bob won't increase his offer much more and with only three rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal."
