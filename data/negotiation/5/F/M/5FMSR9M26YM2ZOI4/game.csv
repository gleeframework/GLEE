,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $140 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $160?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
