"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer starts at the midpoint between Alice's desired price ($8,000) and his own maximum budget ($10,000). This is a strong starting point that shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also trying to get a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to her.  Bob can still aim for a lower price, especially since he has time to negotiate. There's still room for a better deal, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and I pay $8,750?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price that is closer to his target price of $8,500 but is still slightly higher than Alice's offer.  This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise while still working towards a favorable deal."
