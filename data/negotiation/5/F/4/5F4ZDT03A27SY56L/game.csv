"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further and confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to move closer to your price point.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make a deal with you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is pushing the very limits of what I can accept.  I believe it's a very fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
