Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further and confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I will aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my target while still leaving some space for further discussion with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to move closer to your price point.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make a deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still below my minimum. I need to hold firm for now.  I'll make another counteroffer, moving slightly closer to his price, but emphasizing that I'm getting close to my limit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is pushing the very limits of what I can accept.  I believe it's a very fair offer considering the value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a tough call, as it's above John's offer, but below my initial target. However, Bob is clearly committed, and getting to this price shows serious interest. Accepting now avoids the risk of him backing out in later rounds, and the potential of not closing a deal at all."
