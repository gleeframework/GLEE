"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  This is a great deal for both of us, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $135.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $150.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price."
