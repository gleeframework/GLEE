{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great value for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's a bit lower than what I'd like to get from John, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $130?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate!  $130 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with, though. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $132.50.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  $132.50 is a decent offer and only a little bit lower than my last counteroffer.  It's probably better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal completely."
