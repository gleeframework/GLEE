"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a little steep for me.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This feels like a fair price considering its value.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To show you I'm serious about getting this done, let's make it $825,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,7,
