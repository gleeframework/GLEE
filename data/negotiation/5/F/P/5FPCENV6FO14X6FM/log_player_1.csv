Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price gives you a buffer.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $15,000, and your offer might be readily accepted.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You can then negotiate down towards $12,000, knowing that's your absolute minimum."
