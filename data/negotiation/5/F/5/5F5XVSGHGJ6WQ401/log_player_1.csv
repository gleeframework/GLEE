"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's best to start with a high price, even if it seems unlikely to be accepted. This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Room for Negotiation:** A $200 starting price leaves room for me to negotiate. It also gives me a good idea of Bob's potential interest and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the product's appeal (""fantastic product you'll love"") might entice Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he is interested. I can still try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Opportunity to explore:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $170.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""reasonable profit, good deal"") to make it seem more appealing.
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm keeping my message short and to the point, focusing on the price and encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $170 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation.  He's shown interest, and I might be able to squeeze a little more out of the deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a chance and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. How about $155? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only asking for a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to be flexible.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and mutual benefit.
* **Final Push:**  I'm pushing for a deal close to my minimum, hoping Bob will accept it rather than risk losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $155 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $145 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, there is a high risk that we'll go back and forth for the remaining rounds, possibly ending with a lower price or no deal at all.
* **Time is Limited:** With only 4 rounds left, it's not guaranteed I can secure a better price.
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a safe outcome considering the remaining time and potential for lower offers from Bob."
