Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $155. This is still a bit above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this will be a more attractive offer to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $150, Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $150, I'm going to sell it to him. This ensures I get at least my minimum value for the product."
