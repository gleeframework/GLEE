"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for your company. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This price would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
