Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for your company. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is too low for me, especially considering he values the product at $1,200,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This price would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, it's important to remember that John is also willing to buy the product for $800,000. It's better to close the deal with Bob now and secure the $800,000 than risk losing him and having to sell to John."
