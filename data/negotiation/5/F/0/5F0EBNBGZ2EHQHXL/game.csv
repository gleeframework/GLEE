"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but my budget is limited.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that's within my budget, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
