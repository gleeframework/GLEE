"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I can buy the product elsewhere for that price.  Let's see if we can agree.",10000.0,Bob,4,
