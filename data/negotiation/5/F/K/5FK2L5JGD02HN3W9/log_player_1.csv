Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you are in a strong position.  You should aim for a price that's higher than your minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Value Emphasis:** You're focusing on the ""unique value and potential"" without explicitly mentioning your bottom line.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,450,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate down.
    *  Still potentially attractive enough for Bob if he sees substantial value beyond $1,200,000.
* **Confidence:**  By stating your offer ""represents a fair deal,"" you project confidence in your pricing. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects this price, you can gauge his seriousness and potentially come down slightly. However, never go below your $1,500,000 minimum, as John provides a guaranteed sale at that price."
