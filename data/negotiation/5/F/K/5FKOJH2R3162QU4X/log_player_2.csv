"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is within your budget, you know you have a backup option at $150.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject this initial offer."
