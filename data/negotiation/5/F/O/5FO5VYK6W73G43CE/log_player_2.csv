"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've set the price at $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, given its potential benefits to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I can't let this go for less than $1,275,000.  This product truly is exceptional, and I'm confident you'd find it worth the investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $1,275,000 is within Bob's budget and still a good deal for him.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
