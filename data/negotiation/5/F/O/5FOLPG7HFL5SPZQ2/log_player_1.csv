Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000). This strategy aims to maximize my profits while still keeping the deal attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
