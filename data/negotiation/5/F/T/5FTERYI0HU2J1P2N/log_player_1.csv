Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially secure a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive message can encourage Bob to engage in negotiations. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially incentivize him to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers strategically, keeping in mind the value of the product to both of us and the potential alternative buyer (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

* **Room for Improvement:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John as Leverage:** I have a reliable alternative buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming closer to my price. I'm still a bit higher than $930,000. Would you be willing to consider $940,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that we are nearing the end of our negotiation. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}

I'll also consider John's offer and whether I'm comfortable with the risk of continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go above $925,000. I've made a serious offer, and I think it's a good compromise. I'm not budging on this one. Can you meet me at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We are down to the final three rounds.  There's a high risk of not getting a better offer from Bob.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, eliminating any risk or potential for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John, as it's the most secure and profitable option at this stage.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk associated with continuing with Bob is too high, and John's offer is a safe and guaranteed solution."
