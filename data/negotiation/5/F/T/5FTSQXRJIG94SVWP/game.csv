"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm excited about the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value we've both agreed on, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000 to you. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product.  This price is still a significant discount from your initial offer and would allow us to close this deal efficiently.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
