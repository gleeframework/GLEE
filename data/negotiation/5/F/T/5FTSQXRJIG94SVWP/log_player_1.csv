Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm excited about the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value we've both agreed on, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
