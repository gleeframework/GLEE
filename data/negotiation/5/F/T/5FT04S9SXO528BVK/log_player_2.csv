"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for much cheaper than $900,000.  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and your maximum budget, making it worthwhile to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price of $900,000, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This creates room for further negotiation while still demonstrating your willingness to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that the price won't drop much further, and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and delaying the purchase is present. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within Bob's budget and saves a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
