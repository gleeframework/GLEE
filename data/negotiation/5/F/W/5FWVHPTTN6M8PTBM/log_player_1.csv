Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $20,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even if this price is rejected, it sets a frame for the subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I know I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and my initial offer ($20,000). Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product is truly unique and valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:** I'm making a significant concession from $20,000 to $17,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, this price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offers can feel like a fair compromise to Bob, even though it's still heavily in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to compromise, his latest offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer to reach my acceptable range.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
