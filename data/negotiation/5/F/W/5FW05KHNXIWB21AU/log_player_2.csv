"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $110 is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but I'm not sure if I can get Alice to go lower.  I'll counteroffer one more time before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $108? I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $109 is my final offer. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a great price and me to earn a fair amount.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $109, which is close to my budget, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of going to John and paying $120."
