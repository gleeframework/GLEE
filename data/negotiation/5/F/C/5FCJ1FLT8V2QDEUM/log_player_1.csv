Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal and a slight discount while still securing a profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
