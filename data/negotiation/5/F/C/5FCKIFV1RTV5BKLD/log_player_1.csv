Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  You are still making a profit ($1,400,000 - $1,500,000 = -$100,000).
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he is getting a significant discount.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can always adjust the price if Bob counteroffers.

**Important Note:** The best strategy depends on your level of risk aversion.  You could offer a lower price to increase the chances of Bob accepting, but you would have to accept a smaller profit. Or, you could offer a higher price to maximize your profit, but you risk Bob rejecting the offer and you having to sell to John."
