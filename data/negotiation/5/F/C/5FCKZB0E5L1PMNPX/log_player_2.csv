"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't let it go for any less than $80. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, getting you a better deal."
