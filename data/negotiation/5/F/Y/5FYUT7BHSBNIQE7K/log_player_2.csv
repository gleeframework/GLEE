It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can still buy from John for $1,200,000 if you can't get a better deal."

You're getting closer to your target price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if you don't get a better deal."
