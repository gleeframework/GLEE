"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $12,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my seriousness in negotiating but also leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Fairness:** $12,500 is still a decent price for Alice, considering her valuation of $15,000.  
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows for potential counter-offers from Alice, which can lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13250. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget of $12,000. 
* **Potential for lower price:** There's still room for negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so I can likely push for a lower price in the next round.
* **Safeguard:** Buying from John for $12,000 is still a viable option if this negotiation doesn't work out."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,500 and Alice's current offer of $13,250. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and reach a solution.
* **Reasonable for both:**  $12,750 is still a good price for Alice considering her valuation of $15,000, and it's within my budget. 
* **Closing the gap:** By offering a price closer to Alice's, I'm increasing the chances of her accepting and avoiding the risk of losing the deal by going to John."
