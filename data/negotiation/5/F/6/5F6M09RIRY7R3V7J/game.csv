"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13250. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12750? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,4,
