Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $850,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
