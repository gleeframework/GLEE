Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
    * It's close enough to John's offer to create a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, we aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept our initial offer without much negotiation."
