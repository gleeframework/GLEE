``` 

This offer represents a compromise. It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob accepts, I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price, but I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $900,000.  While it's good that he's interested, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd need to see an offer closer to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $850,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I want to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $785,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
