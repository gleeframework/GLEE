"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even my own minimum ($1,500,000), I leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor. While Bob might counter with a much lower offer, the initial high price sets a reference point that can influence the subsequent negotiation in my favor. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be very telling. It will give me insight into his level of interest and how aggressively he might counter.

It's important to remember I always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to negotiate. It's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge this gap. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a higher price while keeping the negotiation alive. I'll aim to meet him somewhere in the middle with my counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 was my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, signaling flexibility. However, it's not a drastic drop, showing I'm still aiming for a strong return. 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits and justifying the high price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum. It allows room for further negotiation but keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his bid significantly if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product, while also respecting my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:**  He's already made a significant jump from his initial offer.
* **Become frustrated:** Prolonged negotiations could sour the deal. 

Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal ($400,000 above my minimum) without risking the loss of the sale altogether."
