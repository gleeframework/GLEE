Bob is stubbornly sticking to $850,000.  I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a higher price. There are still several rounds left and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."

```

We are running out of time, and Bob is not willing to move much higher.  Even though $820,000 is slightly better than selling to John,  it's not a significant enough difference to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept John's offer and move on."
