"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly suggesting the product is worth more than $8,000 in my message without directly mentioning my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he has shown interest. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $8,000.  Let's split the difference. Would you be willing to pay $8,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but not completely giving in. This demonstrates good faith.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm re-iterating the value of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to push him a little higher.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,350.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility again, but only moving a small amount to demonstrate I'm serious about closing the deal while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is a ""significant compromise"" to make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm again emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Note:** I'm still trying to close the deal with Bob at a better price than John's offer, but I'm also keeping in mind the limited rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,150? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the distance we've come in our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I am still not willing to go below $8,200 at this point. I am aware that John is offering a much better deal, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

I'm going to stick with my current strategy of gradually compromising while keeping the negotiation alive. If Bob rejects my next counteroffer, I will strongly consider John's offer in the following round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,250. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the best I can offer while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Concession:** I'm highlighting the ""significant concession"" to convey that I'm approaching my limit.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding ""Let's close this deal"" to subtly suggest that this might be my final offer.

**Note:**  I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, but I'm also keeping in mind the limited rounds and John's offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,100? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the distance we've come in our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I've decided to sell the product to John.  Even though I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  John's offer of $10,000 is a much better outcome for me at this point."
