{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum value of $12,000, but it's also a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price while still keeping the deal attractive for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm interested in selling to him, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. I'll counter his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10500}
