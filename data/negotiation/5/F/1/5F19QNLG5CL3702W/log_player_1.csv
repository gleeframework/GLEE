"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1500000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price closer to $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is inching closer to a more reasonable offer. However, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to make this deal work."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm dropping my price considerably in this round to signal some flexibility but also to hold firm above my $1,200,000 minimum. This should encourage Bob to make a significant move upward if he's serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, my budget tops out at $800,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can close this deal. How about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum budget, which is significantly below my minimum.  It's clear that continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a successful outcome for me.  Therefore, the best course of action is to sell the product to John for my desired price."
