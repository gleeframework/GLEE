"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that's workable for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,5,
