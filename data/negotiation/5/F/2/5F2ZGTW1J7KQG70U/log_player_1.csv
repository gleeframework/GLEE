Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $135 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $145 in a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $135. This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to meet me in the middle while still earning me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to make me comfortable.  I'm going to sell to John for $120.  It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
