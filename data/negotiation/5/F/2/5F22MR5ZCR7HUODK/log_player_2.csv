"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point given my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Alice and I can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to pay $8,000, Alice's offer of $10,000 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her previous offers.  It's better to secure the product at a price that is still acceptable than to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Alice change her mind or get a better offer from someone else."
