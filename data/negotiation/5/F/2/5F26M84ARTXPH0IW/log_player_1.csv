{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my desired outcome but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up to my price or if I need to lower it a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $85 for it. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is a little low for me. How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose $87 for the product. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still lower than your current proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $95,  $87 is a fair price considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and my minimum price threshold of $80. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
