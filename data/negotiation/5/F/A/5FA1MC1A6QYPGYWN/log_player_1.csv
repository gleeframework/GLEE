Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a significant profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's find a compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fantastic deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep. I'm ready to pay $1,200,000. This would be a good profit for you, and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,500,000, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now in a reasonable range. Accepting $1,200,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
