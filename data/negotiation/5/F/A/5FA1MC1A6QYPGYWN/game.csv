"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a significant profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a fantastic deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep. I'm ready to pay $1,200,000. This would be a good profit for you, and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
