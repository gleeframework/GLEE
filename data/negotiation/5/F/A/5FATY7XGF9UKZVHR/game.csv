"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $6,200. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,200 and $5,750, which would be $6,000. It's the best I can do. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Alice,5,
