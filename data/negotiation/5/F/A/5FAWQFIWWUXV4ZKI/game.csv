"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above your new price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
