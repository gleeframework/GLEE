"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth more than that to you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer saves you money."
