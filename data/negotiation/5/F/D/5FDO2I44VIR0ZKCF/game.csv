"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing its value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Let's start with a price of $13,000 and see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $12,000, but I'm not willing to go that low.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a reasonable price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, let's try $14,000.  I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad to hear you're genuinely interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as high as $14,750. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final concession. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options. I'm confident that this product will find a buyer who values it at its true worth.",15000.0,Alice,7,
