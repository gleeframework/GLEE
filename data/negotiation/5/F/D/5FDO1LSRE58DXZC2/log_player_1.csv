This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. It's important to balance getting the best price with keeping Bob interested in the deal.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $18,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and the negotiation seems to have reached a stalemate.  It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
