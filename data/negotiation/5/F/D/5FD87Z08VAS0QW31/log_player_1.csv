Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full price I'm willing to accept, $1,200,000. This is the price John is willing to pay, so if Bob rejects, I can immediately sell to John and avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm aiming for the full $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's no risk in continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price and significantly higher than his previous offers.  While I would prefer to get the full $1,200,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise that gets me closer to my target.  There's a good chance that continuing negotiations won't get me a better price, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if I need to walk away from the deal."
