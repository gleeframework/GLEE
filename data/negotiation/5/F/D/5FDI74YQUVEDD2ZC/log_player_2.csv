"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum price than her minimum. I should counter with a much lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but she only came down $1,000. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I can do $7,000.  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I think $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice went up in price! This tells me she might be getting frustrated and willing to settle soon. I'll hold firm again and see if she comes down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I.  $7,000 is a fair offer, and I'm sticking to it. If you can't do that, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm reiterating my $7,000 offer and adding a subtle threat to walk away. This might push Alice to accept or offer a more reasonable counter."
