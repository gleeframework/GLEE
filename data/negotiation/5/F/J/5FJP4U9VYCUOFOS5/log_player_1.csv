Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to try and get the best possible price. Offering it to Bob first at a higher price could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,400,000 is still significantly less than John's offer, making it an attractive proposition for Bob. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a limited-time offer and other potential buyers, I am encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to balance securing a good deal with the knowledge that I have a guaranteed sale at a lower price."
