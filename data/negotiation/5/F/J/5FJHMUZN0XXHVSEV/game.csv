"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's worth more than $150 to you, so this is a great deal! Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $138? That's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you. What do you say?",138.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $138 is a fair compromise for me. I was thinking more like $132. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,132.0,Bob,4,
