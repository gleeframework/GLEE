"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I'll try to convince him that the product is worth more than $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```
 
I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. My goal is to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John in the future if this falls through, but it's a good deal for now."
