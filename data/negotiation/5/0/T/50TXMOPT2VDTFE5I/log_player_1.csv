"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves some profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $102. While I would prefer a higher price,  it's a good deal given that it's only two rounds away from my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer in the remaining rounds."
