"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at a minimum of $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1150000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1120000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle and consider this offer?",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1120000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1135000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1135000.0,Alice,5,
