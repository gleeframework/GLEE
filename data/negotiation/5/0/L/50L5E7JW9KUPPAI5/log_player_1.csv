Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for slightly less, aiming closer to his perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer if he wants.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm guaranteed $12,000 from John. This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible outcome."
