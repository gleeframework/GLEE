"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer represents a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you, considering your valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $975,000? This price reflects the product's true value and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
