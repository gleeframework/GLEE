"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer represents a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you, considering your valuation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $975,000? This price reflects the product's true value and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $975,000 is still above my budget.  It's closer, but I'm going to try to negotiate further.  There's still room to lower the price before I consider buying from John."
