Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the market demand, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in making a deal, so I'd be willing to offer you $10,000.
