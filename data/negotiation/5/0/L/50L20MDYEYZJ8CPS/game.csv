"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the market demand, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in making a deal, so I'd be willing to offer you $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe that reflects the product's true value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a very competitive offer considering the value you're getting.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $13,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",13000.0,Bob,6,
