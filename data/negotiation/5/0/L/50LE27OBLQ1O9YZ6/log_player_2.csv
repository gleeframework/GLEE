"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will greatly benefit you.  As a starting point, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offering process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
