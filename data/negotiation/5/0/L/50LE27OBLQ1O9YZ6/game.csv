"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will greatly benefit you.  As a starting point, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings is significant, and $850,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
