Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Alice:** $1,200,000
* **Value to John (fallback):** $1,200,000
* **Offer to Bob:** $1,500,000

This offer gives Alice a chance to earn more than her minimum value, while still being a potentially attractive price to Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential Gain:**  A $300,000 gain over the minimum value is significant.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum value, ensuring no loss.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  A higher offer increases the chance of rejection but also maximizes potential profit.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic decision. The optimal price depends on Alice's assessment of Bob's likely willingness to pay. If Alice believes Bob might be willing to pay even more, she could increase the offer further."
