# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay the full $800,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
