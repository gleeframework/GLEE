Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a worthwhile investment for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  This price allows for some back-and-forth negotiation without putting me in a position where I have to accept a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also much lower than my initial offer of $12,000, indicating he's not seriously considering the value I'm offering. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product and my time. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more acceptable price.
* **John is a Strong Alternative:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, which makes me less likely to settle for a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is far below the value I'm offering.  To show you I'm serious about finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the quality and potential of the product, while also acknowledging your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer, But Not Too Much:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $9,000, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Value Re-Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to make it clear that my offer is still fair.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $9,000 is still well above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell the product at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my initial price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Accepting:** Accepting his offer would mean selling the product significantly below its value to me.
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a solid alternative in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Before John:** I'm making a final offer before going to John. I'm lowering my price a bit more, but staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fair Price:**  I'm reiterating that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm encouraging Bob to close the deal and avoid going to John. 

I hope this approach helps to reach a satisfactory agreement!"
