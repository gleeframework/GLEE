"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000.**  This is more than the product is worth to you ($1,000,000 maximum). 
* **John's offer is $1,000,000.** This is also more than the product is worth to you, but it's still less than Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $50,000.** 

Even though you're still paying more than the product is worth to you, rejecting Alice's offer gets you the best possible deal."
