``` 

This offer starts with a higher price than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a discussion about the price. This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially learn more about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
