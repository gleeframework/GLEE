"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd be happy to sell it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer, how about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
