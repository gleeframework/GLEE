"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120 and Alice is offering the product for $120, it makes sense to accept her offer. You're not getting a discount, but you're also not spending more than you're willing to."
