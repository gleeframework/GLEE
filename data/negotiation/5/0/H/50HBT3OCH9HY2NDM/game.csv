"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product.  However, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let's see if we can make a deal.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $145. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $142, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",142.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $142. I'm willing to give you a small discount and sell the product to you for $148. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",148.0,Alice,7,
