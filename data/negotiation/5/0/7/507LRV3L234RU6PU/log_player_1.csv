Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then lower the price a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is still a good profit for me, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price.  If not, I can still sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from him. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John.  While $15,000 isn't ideal, it's still better than risking more time with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
