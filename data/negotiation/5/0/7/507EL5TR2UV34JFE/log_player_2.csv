"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking $95. You're willing to pay up to $100, so you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I really appreciate you offering me this product.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good deal for you as it's below your maximum price of $100.  Accepting her offer is the best option, as it saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
