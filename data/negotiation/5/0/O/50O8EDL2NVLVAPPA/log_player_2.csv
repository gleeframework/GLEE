"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident you'll find it a very good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
