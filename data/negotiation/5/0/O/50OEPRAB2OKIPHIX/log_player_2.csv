Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my previous offer of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  While negotiating with Alice might get a slightly lower price, the difference isn't worth the risk of her backing out. Buying from John guarantees the product at my target price."
