"Thanks for your offer, Alice, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice.  While I know it's valuable, $12,000 is still above what I had budgeted. Could we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my previous offer of $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
