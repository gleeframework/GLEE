"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1100000 for the item. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not quite at the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum value of $1400000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
