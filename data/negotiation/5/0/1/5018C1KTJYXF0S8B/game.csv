"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value, and while my minimum price is $1,200,000, I'm willing to open negotiations at $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is quite high for my budget.  Could we settle on a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low.  Could you consider a price of $950,000? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price would allow me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value to you.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're narrowing down the gap, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.  How about we settle on $900,000?  This reflects a significant compromise on my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option to acquire a similar product for $800,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need the price to be closer to that figure for it to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $815,000?",815000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and have tried to be flexible. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're currently offering. I'm willing to make one final concession at $875,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you'll receive.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and I understand this is valuable to you. I'm willing to increase my offer to $830,000.  However, I need to be upfront that if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move forward with my alternative option.  I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the value while working within my constraints.",830000.0,Bob,8,
