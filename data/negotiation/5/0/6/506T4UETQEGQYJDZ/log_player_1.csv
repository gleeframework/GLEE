"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a bold offer, aiming for a high initial price. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation. This approach allows me to see if he's truly interested in a deal and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round. I believe there's room for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $875,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about selling to him while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to accept it. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that I'll get a higher offer from Bob, and I could risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for the same price would be a safe option, but I'm confident in reaching a deal with Bob now."
