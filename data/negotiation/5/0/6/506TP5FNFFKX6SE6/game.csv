"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident this price is fair and will allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $850,000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $812,500. This gives us both a fair price that's closer to our respective positions. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
