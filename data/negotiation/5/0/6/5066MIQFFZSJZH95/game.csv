"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my original price. I can do $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14000, which would be $13000. Would you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $14000, which would be $13500. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'd like to make a final offer of $12000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to purchase the product from you.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I've been very patient with you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $13000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other buyers. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
