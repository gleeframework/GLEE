""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a special price of $950,000. I believe it holds significant value that surpasses even its price tag, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:**  He gets a $50,000 discount from the product's perceived value to him ($800,000).
    * **For Alice:** She earns a substantial profit of $950,000, which is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing Alice's potential earnings."
