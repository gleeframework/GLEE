"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has a maximum willingness to pay of $120, and Alice's minimum selling price is $80. This means there's room for both sides to find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  "", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering $95, which is within Bob's budget.
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  While there might be some room to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John costs $120, which is significantly more than Alice's offer. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a good price and saves $25 compared to buying from John."
