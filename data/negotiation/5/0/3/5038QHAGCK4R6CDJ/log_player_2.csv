"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get it for a price that's still within your budget, and I'll still get a good price for it. If you're interested, let me know, but I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,500,000 so I need to know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price point."
