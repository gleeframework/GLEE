Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm still only comfortable with $18,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 18500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $19500. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $19,500 is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. While I'm close to reaching an agreement with Alice, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that we might not reach a deal that works for both of us. 

Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget, I'm going to choose to buy the product from John. This guarantees that I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Alice."
