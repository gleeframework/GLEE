Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my desired profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $150, ensuring I don't lose out."
