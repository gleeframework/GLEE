"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price yet. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to go down to $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Positive framing:** I continue to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of the offer.
* **Clear expectation:** I'm prompting Bob to respond directly, indicating that I'm ready to move forward with a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I want to see if I can push a little further.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $85 and my previous offer of $90.
* **Positive language:**  The message uses positive language to emphasize the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Finality:** The message suggests that this is a fair and reasonable offer, hinting at the possibility of finality."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've gone through several rounds, and while Bob is willing to negotiate, we're still quite far apart in our desired prices.  At this point, with only four rounds left, I'm getting concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for me.  

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, it's in my best interest to take the sure thing and sell to him. This way, I don't risk losing time and potentially ending up with a much lower sale price with Bob."
