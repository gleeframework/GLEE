"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $1,200,000 maximum.
* **Strategic Number:** $1,050,000 is 70% of Alice's initial offer and a round number. This might make her more receptive than a less ""clean"" number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message expresses willingness to negotiate, signaling I'm serious about purchasing but want a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as I can't go any lower and John offers the same price. It's best to accept and secure the deal with Alice."
