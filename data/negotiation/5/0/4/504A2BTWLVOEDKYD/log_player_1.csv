Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused. 

By starting with this offer, you are setting the stage for a productive negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I am willing to consider $9,100 as a fair price for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my minimum and it seems like he is not willing to negotiate further.  To avoid risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation, I will accept his offer and sell the product."
