Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired selling price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Message:** I'm framing the message in a positive way, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This could encourage him to consider my offer and make a counteroffer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. This offer is based on the assumption that it's likely higher than my minimum value. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my offer. My counteroffers will depend on his counteroffers and my assessment of his willingness to pay.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is a backup buyer at $15,000. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Incentive for Counteroffer:**  I have no reason to believe I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away.  There's no guarantee he'll make another counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** While John is a backup buyer at the same price, there's no guarantee he'll be available in the future, so it's better to secure the sale with Bob now.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision given the information available. It secures the minimum value and prevents the risk of losing the sale entirely."
