Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he haggles.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a reason (even if vague) can sometimes make buyers more receptive.  Mentioning that you believe the product is highly valuable to Bob specifically aims to pique his interest. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite a counter-offer from Bob, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, there's still room to negotiate down to $100, ensuring you get at least your minimum price from John."
