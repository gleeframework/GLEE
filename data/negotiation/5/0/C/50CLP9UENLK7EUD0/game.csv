"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750.
