It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  A price of $1,300,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000.

We can try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer will give us another opportunity to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Let's increase our offer slightly, but we're still well below Alice's last offer. This shows we're serious about getting a deal but are also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good price considering our initial goal. We're saving $135,000 from the original asking price and getting a decent deal.  While there's always the possibility of getting an even lower price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating, especially with the time limit.  We're within our budget and have a solid deal.  Let's close it!"
