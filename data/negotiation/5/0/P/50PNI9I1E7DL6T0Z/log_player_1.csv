Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you due to [mention a reason why the product is valuable to Bob specifically].  I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value justification:** Highlighting the product's specific value to Bob makes him more likely to accept a higher price. 
* **Sense of exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and encourage him to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower (but still above your minimum).
* **Negotiation skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go."
