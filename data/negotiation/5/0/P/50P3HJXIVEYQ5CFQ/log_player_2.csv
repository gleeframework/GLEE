Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you have a budget, $1,080,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing a price of $1,120,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
