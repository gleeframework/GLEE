"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary.** I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is an option, but not yet the best.**  While I could buy from John, it's better to explore if I can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given my research, I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more realistic for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation is still necessary.** I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to overpay for this product. 
* **John is still an option.** I'm not yet ready to commit to John, but I'm keeping him in mind as a backup."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
