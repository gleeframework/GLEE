"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to the product's worth to him, he can get it for an even lower price from John.  He can save $1,000 by going with John."
