Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your interest in the product is genuine, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000, which is $800,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. My final offer is $800,000 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** She explicitly stated she won't go any lower than $800,000.
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $200,000 less than your maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Continuing might frustrate Alice, and you risk her walking away from the deal entirely. 

Accepting now secures a favorable price and avoids potential complications."
