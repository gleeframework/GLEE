{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get close to what I think the product is worth. If Bob rejects this, I can then consider his counteroffer and decide whether to lower my price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above his own valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can make a good profit even at this price.  I'm accepting the offer."
