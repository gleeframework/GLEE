"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Buying from John achieves the same outcome at the same price, so it's the most logical choice. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice further as the potential for a lower price is non-existent."
