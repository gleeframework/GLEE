# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  I think this is a fair price considering both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
