"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to part with this amazing product for this price, and I think it's a great value considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  I think this is a fair price considering both our needs.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
