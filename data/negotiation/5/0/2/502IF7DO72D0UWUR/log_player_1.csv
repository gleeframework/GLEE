Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, since that's our guaranteed fallback with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward about the offer and implies you know the product's worth. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes we don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, just the product's inherent value to him. If we had more information about Bob's budget or urgency, we could potentially push the price higher."
