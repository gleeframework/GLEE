"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and there's a risk that further negotiations might lead to a lower offer or a stalemate.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is above my minimum."
