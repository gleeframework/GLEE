"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm on a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $110? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Bob,4,
