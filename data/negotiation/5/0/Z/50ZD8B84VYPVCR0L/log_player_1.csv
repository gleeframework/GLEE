"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation and set the tone that I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm countering with $10,250. This is another compromise, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be the price point that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offers still being below my minimum value, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  It's guaranteed profit and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
