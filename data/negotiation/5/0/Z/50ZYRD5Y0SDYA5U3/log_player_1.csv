Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

How about we split the difference and agree on $825,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works.
