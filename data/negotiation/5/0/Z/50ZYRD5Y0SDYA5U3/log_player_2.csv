"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but there's room for improvement.  You have a clear target of $1,200,000 as a maximum, and Alice's offer is well below that.  There's no need to rush into a deal when you have the option to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the process and potentially reach a price closer to $800,000.  You're still well within your budget, and there's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can get closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $825,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $860,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $860,000.  While you'd prefer a lower price, it's getting close to your target and it's still a good deal considering you have a backup option of buying from John for $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate could take time and may not guarantee a better price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and allows you to move on from the negotiation."
