Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $12,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to move from this $12,000 price point. We've been slowly inching up and she seems to be resetting back to this number. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her, and with only one round left, it's too risky to continue. Buying from John for $15,000 ensures we get the product."
