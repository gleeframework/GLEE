"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,750? It's a bit above your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but this still isn't quite working for me.  I'd be willing to do $11,000 even. That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,750? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to raise my offer to $11,250, but that's absolutely my limit.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $12,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,9,
