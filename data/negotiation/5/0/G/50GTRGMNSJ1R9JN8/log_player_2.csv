"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I'm confident will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. This is a steal, considering its true value to me is at least $1000000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you say? Are you interested in making a deal?
