Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product while also allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
