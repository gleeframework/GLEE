"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a generous price considering the value you've described. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1200000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1350000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1300000. This is the lowest price I can accept and still ensure the product's value is preserved. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
