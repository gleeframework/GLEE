{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see if Bob bites, and if not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping this is close enough to his desired price that he'll accept, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's above my minimum price of $1,500,000, and it's getting close to what I was hoping for. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on this sale."
