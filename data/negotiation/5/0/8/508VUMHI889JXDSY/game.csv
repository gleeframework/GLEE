"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it, and allows me to get a better price.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. While $1300000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
