Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $1,200,000 floor, showing you're not desperate for a sale.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You leave room for negotiation, making it more likely he'll accept or counteroffer.
* **It's a ""fair"" price:** You justify it, making it less likely Bob feels you're trying to take advantage.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price, while still having the backup of John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it, and allows me to get a better price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you're in a strong position. You know the product is worth more to him ($1,500,000), and there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you leverage to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** You're not accepting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.  
* **Compromise:** You're dropping your price by $50,000, showing flexibility but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Justification:** You emphasize the value to Bob, making your counteroffer seem fair. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still positioning you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
