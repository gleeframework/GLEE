"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a price of $14,000. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Bob should reject the offer and go with John, as that's the only option within his budget."
