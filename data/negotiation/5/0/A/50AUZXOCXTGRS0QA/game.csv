"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
