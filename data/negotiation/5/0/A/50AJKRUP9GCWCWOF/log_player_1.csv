{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $1,450,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him a clear incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This price indicates you're open to negotiation, increasing the chances of reaching a deal.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to explore if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe a price closer to $1,400,000 would be more fair. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
This counteroffer:

* **Maintains a higher price:** It's higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating your commitment to a profitable sale. 
* **Shows flexibility:** It's lower than your initial offer, indicating you're willing to negotiate further. 
* **Emphasizes value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, justifying your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is still lower than your initial goal, it's a decent compromise that allows you to secure a sale with Bob.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and forcing you to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
