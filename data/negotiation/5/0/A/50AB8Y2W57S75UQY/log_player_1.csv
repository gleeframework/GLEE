Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit of $1,500.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $10,750? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with that margin.  It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale for $10,000. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially get a lower offer or risk a stalemate. I'm going to sell to John."
