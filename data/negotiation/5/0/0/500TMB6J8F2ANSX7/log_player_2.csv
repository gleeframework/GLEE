"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above his target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  While $9,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his target. Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
