"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
