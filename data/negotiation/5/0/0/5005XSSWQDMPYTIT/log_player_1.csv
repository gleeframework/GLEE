This is a starting point.  I'm offering $11,500. This is a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, knowing that he values it at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's also higher than what John is offering, so it makes more sense to accept Bob's offer."
