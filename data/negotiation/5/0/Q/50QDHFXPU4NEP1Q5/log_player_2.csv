"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. He has room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value I know you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, $18,000 is still too high. There's room to continue negotiating, and he can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my price range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still too high.  There's room to continue negotiating, and he can still try to get a lower price from Alice.  He's already come close to his limit, but if they can meet in the middle, he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a decent profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $12000 is still not enough for me to make a profit that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $12000, which would be $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $14,000 is still too high, and he's already come close to his limit.   He should make one more counteroffer to see if he can get a better deal.  If Alice doesn't budge, he can always buy from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my last offer of $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
