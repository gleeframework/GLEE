"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it to you for $14,000. I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks good, but  $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $10,500 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept that price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I could go up to $10,800. Hopefully, that's agreeable for you.",10800.0,Bob,6,
