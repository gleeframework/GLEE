"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,000, which is still a good value for you.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate your flexibility, Alice, and I'm glad to hear that $10,000 is the lowest you're willing to go. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in a request: can you throw in some additional support or warranty with the product to make it an even better value for me? If so, I'd be willing to meet you at $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
