"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $120 to Alice and she's offering it for $135. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You want to save money:** Your goal is to get the best deal possible, so rejecting the offer and negotiating further is the best option. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair compromise:**  My counteroffer of $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's below Alice's offer but still allows her to make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further from her original offer. 
* **Strategic starting point:** Starting with a $125 counteroffer gives me room to negotiate down further if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While slightly lower than her original offer, $140 is still above the product's value to Alice. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating.  A counteroffer might push Alice closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John is a safety net:** I can always buy from John, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to a deal:** By offering $130, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.
* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This offer is halfway between Alice's current offer of $140 and my previous offer of $125.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** If Alice rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction:**  Alice's offer has actually gone up to $145 from $140, making it less attractive. 
* **More negotiation needed:** I'm still determined to get a better deal and believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a last resort:** I'm not ready to give up on getting a lower price from Alice.

**Next Steps:** I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than $145 in the next round, hopefully pushing Alice back towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and pressure:** I'm offering $135, which is a middle ground between my last offer of $130 and Alice's current offer of $145. This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway but also puts pressure on her to lower her price.
* **Strategic positioning:** If Alice rejects this, I can still offer $130 in the next round, or even $125 if necessary. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the rounds, so I need to start closing the deal. However, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unreasonable:** Alice's offer of $150 is the same as John's price, making it pointless to continue negotiating with her.
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's unlikely Alice will come down from her price.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  Buying from John provides a sure way to get the product without further hassle or risk of a failed negotiation. 

I'm choosing to buy from John to ensure I get the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a failed deal."
