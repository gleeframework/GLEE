Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. It's the maximum I am willing to pay for the product.

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is firm on his offer and it's still a profit over John's offer. It's best to accept and avoid potentially losing both buyers."
