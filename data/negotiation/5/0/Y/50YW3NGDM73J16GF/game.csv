"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $110. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase if you can meet me there.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to commit to the purchase. However, $100 is still a bit lower than I was thinking.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $110. I can offer it to you for $112.50, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $108? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase if you can meet me there.",108.0,Bob,8,
