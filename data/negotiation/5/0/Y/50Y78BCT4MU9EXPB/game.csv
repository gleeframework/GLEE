"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking around $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your price point, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $130 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but only if you increase your offer to $135. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $132, but no more. That's my final offer.",132.0,Bob,6,
