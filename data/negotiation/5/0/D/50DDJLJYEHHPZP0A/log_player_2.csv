It's always good to try and negotiate a better price.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $8,000 is a significant discount, but still leaves room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is moving closer to my target price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her down even further."
