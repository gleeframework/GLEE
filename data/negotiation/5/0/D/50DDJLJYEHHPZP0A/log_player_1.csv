"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000 to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  Since I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, this leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I don't want to risk losing this sale and potentially having to accept John's lower offer."
