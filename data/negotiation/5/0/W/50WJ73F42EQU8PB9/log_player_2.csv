You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for more. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!

You have three options:

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to go with John and save $875."
