"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Alice has indicated a value of $10,000 for the product, meaning there's potential to get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11800. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,800, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  It's still worth trying to push for a lower price.  Rejection allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a compromise: $11700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,700, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $11,500.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price, saving $3,300 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on is high."
