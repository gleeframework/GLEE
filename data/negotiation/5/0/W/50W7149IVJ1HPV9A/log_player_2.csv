"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the deal, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $9,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his preferred price. He wants to see if he can negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
