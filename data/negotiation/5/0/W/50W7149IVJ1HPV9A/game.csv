"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the deal, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go to $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
