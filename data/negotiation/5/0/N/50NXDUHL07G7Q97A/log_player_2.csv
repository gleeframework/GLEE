"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to counter-offer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Even though Alice has come down to $9,100, that's still above Bob's maximum budget. He's already made several counteroffers and is clearly not going to get the price lower than $8,000, which is the price John is offering."
