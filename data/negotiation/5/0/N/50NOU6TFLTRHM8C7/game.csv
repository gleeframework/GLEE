"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $14,000?  That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can do $16,500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
