"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It makes sense to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to establish a bargaining position and gauge her flexibility.
* **Reasonable but Optimistic:**  $6,000 is a reasonable price in the context of my $8,000 maximum and allows room for negotiation. 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm politely explaining that the initial offer is out of my range and directly proposing a price I'd consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $10,000 is still above both my budget and John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's room for further price reduction.
* **Leverage:**  I have John's offer as a backup, so I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want to acknowledge Alice's move toward a compromise, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm that her previous offer is too high while proposing a price that is a significant concession on my part. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $7,500 is a strong counter-offer that:
    * Is below my $8,000 maximum.
    * Splits the difference between her current offer ($10,000) and my previous offer ($6,000).
    * Leaves some room for a final, smaller concession from me if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $9,000 is getting closer to an acceptable range.
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  I'm still above my fallback price of $8,000 from John. This gives me a bit more room to push for a better deal from Alice. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, so it's a good time to start nudging Alice closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm now presenting my maximum price. It's important to be firm at this stage and signal that this is my limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that I'm ready to deal *immediately* if she accepts this offer.
* **Walk-Away Option:**  I'm implicitly reminding Alice that I have John's offer as a backup by not going above $8,000. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  We're in a tight range now. It's possible Alice might accept $8,000 to avoid the risk of me going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $8,500. I've been equally clear that my maximum is $8,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and further haggling is unlikely to close the gap.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** I have a reliable alternative with John at $8,000. There's no point in risking losing that price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. 

It's been a good negotiation attempt, but sometimes walking away is the best way to secure the best possible deal."
