Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, $140 is still a significant profit over selling to John for $120."
