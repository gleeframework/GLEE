"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $120. I appreciate your interest in the product! However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $120, Alice. How about we settle at $140? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
