"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? That still gives you a good deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to move it without taking too much of a loss.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering my budget, would it be possible for you to lower the price to $9,000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $9,500. This gives you a great price on the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
