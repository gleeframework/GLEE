I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a good profit margin while still leaving some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000.  This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit with ensuring I don't lose out on a sale entirely."
