"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated and it's worth at least $10,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I have another buyer lined up at $10,000. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,
