"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated and it's worth at least $10,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I have another buyer lined up at $10,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
