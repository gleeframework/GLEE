Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know the product's value to Bob ($150) and my minimum acceptable price ($150), I want to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $175 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup who guarantees I'll get my minimum price."
