"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strategic move to establish a lower price range for negotiations. While it's possible Alice might reject this offer, it sets a precedent for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final push towards his target price.  He knows that John is selling the product for $800,000, so this offer is his final attempt to secure the product at his budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has the safety net of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $820,000 is slightly above Bob's ideal budget, it's a good compromise. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations.  It's also only $20,000 more than John's price, which is a manageable difference."
