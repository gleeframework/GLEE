Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
