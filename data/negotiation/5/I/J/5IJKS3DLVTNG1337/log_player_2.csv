"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer, aiming to land closer to his desired price point.  A $750,000 offer is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's closer to his budget, Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. It's better to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer at his maximum budget. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. This is a good strategy to try and secure a deal close to his target price."
