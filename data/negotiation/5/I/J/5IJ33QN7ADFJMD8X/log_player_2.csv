The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $180. This is significantly higher than Bob's limit, so he should reject the offer."

While $160 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than his ideal price.  He should reject and try to negotiate further."

This offer is still lower than Alice's price but closer to Bob's limit. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within Bob's budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer, Bob is still better off rejecting and making another counteroffer. He's already close to his limit with John's offer and has shown Alice he's willing to negotiate."

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer and staying within Bob's budget. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price."
