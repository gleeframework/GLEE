**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this work.  This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate a lower price. There is still room to bargain, and Bob has a good alternative option with John."
