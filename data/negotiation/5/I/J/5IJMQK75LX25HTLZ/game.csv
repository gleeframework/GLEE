"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to recover a bit more to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to see some movement from your side.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $1,050,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",980000.0,Bob,6,
