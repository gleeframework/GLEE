"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering its value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $11,250? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
