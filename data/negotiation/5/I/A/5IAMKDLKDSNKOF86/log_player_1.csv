"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I know the product is worth $120 to him, so I'm leaving some room for compromise. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $155. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I hope this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $135 is closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price of $145. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. I hope this offer will finally convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $150, the negotiation has been going on for several rounds. It's getting close to the point where it might be more efficient to sell to John.  $140 is a decent price and worth the risk of losing John as a buyer."
