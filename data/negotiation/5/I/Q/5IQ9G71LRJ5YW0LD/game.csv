"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I place on it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a very reasonable price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000.
