"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $12000. How about we try something closer to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair given the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. Would $10000 be within your range?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
