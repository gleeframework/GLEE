Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
