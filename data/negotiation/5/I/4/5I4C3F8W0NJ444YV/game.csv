"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, due to the high demand and limited supply of our product, we need to maintain our pricing strategy. Therefore, we are unable to accept the offer at $900,000. We are proposing a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
