Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
