"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
