"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal than his, leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize potential profit. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick negotiation, so I'm not starting too low.
* I'm leaving room for counteroffers, but I'm not afraid to walk away with John's offer if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,450,000, but it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity:** I believe I can still get a better deal by negotiating further.
* **Risk:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations to potentially earn more.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. 
* I'll keep the possibility of selling to John as a backup option if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum.
* **My Counter:**  I'm reducing my price slightly to $1,400,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This should signal to Bob that I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not willing to go too low.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By compromising a little, I'm aiming to push Bob towards a price closer to my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm maintaining a steady approach, ensuring a reasonable profit while keeping the negotiation open.
* I'm staying firm on my desired price range, aiming to get a fair deal."
