Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
