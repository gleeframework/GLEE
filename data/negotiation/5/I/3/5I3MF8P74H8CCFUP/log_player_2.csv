**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum price point of $1,500,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I need to try to negotiate further to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget of $1,500,000 and is a good deal considering it's close to the value Alice places on the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and I might end up buying from John for a higher price. It's time to accept the offer."
