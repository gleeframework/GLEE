"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $15,000 to you for a much lower price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than your maximum budget and $3,000 less than buying from John. Even though you know Alice values it lower, this offer saves you the most money."
