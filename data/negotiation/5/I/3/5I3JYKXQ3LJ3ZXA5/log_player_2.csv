"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Bob wants to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and isn't afraid to start low. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** Bob's message shows he's open to further conversation, which could lead to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives you a significant saving over what it's worth to you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $11,000 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and is within Bob's budget. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting future offers and eventually going with John is high. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's better to lock in a good deal rather than risk running out of time."
