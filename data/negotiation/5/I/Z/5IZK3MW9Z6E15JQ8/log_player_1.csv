Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to seriously consider.  I'll be prepared to adjust if necessary, but I want to see if we can close the deal at a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled about Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves some room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum.  While it's not ideal, I'm willing to accept it.  There's always the risk of continuing the negotiation, but I don't want to risk losing the sale to John and ending up with less than $8,000."
