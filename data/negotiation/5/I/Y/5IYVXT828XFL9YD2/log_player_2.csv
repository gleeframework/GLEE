"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to your company. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its true potential. I'm confident this product will be a significant asset for your business.  Let's discuss a price that is mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.** 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget.**  
* **Although this is the maximum price you're willing to pay, it's still better than accepting Alice's offer.**"
