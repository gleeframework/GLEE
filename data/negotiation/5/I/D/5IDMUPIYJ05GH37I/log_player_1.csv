"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $100.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counter-offering again, this time dropping my price by only $5. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a significantly lower price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference again and go with $100.  I'm really hoping we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum and Bob seems really interested, I'm not willing to give up more ground at this point. I'm hoping I can get him to come up a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50. This is a really fair price, and it's the closest I can come without going below my minimum. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and my willingness to find common ground while still remaining within my acceptable price range."
