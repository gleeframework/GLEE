"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still want to try to negotiate further. I have enough rounds left to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still slightly over my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget. I've already reached my maximum offer and rejected her last counteroffer.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely we won't reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to sell me the product for $10,000, it's in my best interest to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
