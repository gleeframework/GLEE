"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still slightly over my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
