"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob starts with a low counteroffer of $12,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred limit. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob increases his offer slightly to $14,000. This shows he's willing to compromise, but still pushes for a price closer to his target.  He's also getting closer to John's price, making the decision to buy from John more imminent if Alice continues to refuse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his $15,000 limit. Bob is better off rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations, as there's a chance to get the price down even further. He's also getting closer to John's price, which makes buying from John a more tempting option if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob makes his final counteroffer at $15,000. This is his limit, and he's unlikely to go any higher. If Alice rejects this, Bob will likely buy from John to ensure he gets the product.  This is a high-pressure move, putting the onus on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale."
