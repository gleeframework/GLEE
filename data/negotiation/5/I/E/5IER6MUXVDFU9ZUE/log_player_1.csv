Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $220. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 220} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above $150.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value"" rather than just the price, I'm trying to frame the offer in a positive light, even if it seems initially expensive to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum of $150 and even further from my initial asking price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and open the door for further negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm willing to walk away from Bob's offer because I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $120 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by coming down from $220, but not drastically.  Offering $180 is a significant move, but still keeps me above my minimum and aims for a price closer to my initial target.
* **Framing:** By using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""quite a bit lower than I can go,"" I'm emphasizing fairness and suggesting my price is getting closer to the lowest I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $160. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $160 is above my absolute minimum of $150.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and I risk him walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now means closing the deal and securing the profit. Further haggling might not be worth the extra time and effort, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."
