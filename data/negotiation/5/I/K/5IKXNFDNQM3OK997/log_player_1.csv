Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for $125.

{""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $115. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I know he's trying to get a good deal. However, I still want to earn as much as I can for the product, which is worth $120 to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll increase the price slightly, but not too much, since I don't want to scare Bob off. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $118.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's making another offer of $110. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I know he's still trying to get a good deal. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for less than $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and send him another counteroffer. This time, I'll increase the price slightly, but not too much, since I don't want to scare Bob off. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $117.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my counteroffer again, and now he's making another offer of $112. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I know he's still trying to get a good deal. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for less than $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and think carefully about my next move. Since Bob has been willing to go as low as $112, I'm not sure if he'll be willing to go any higher. I'll consider selling the product to John for $120, as it's the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
