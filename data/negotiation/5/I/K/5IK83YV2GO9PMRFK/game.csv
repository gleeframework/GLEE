"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget for this product. I'm ready to make a serious offer if you're interested in getting this deal done. I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go to $875,000. This is a good compromise for us both.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $25,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000. I'll offer you $887,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $887,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875,000.  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,8,

This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,9,
