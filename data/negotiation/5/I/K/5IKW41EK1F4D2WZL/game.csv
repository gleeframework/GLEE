"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",13000.0,Bob,4,
