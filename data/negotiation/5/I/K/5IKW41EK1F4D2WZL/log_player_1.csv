"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to get closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a rejection. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale within a reasonable timeframe and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
