"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,350,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to recover a good portion of my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, he's already very close to his maximum price point.  It's not worth risking a breakdown in negotiations to save a small amount of money."
