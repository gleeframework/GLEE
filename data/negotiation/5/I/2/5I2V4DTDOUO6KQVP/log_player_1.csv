Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a backup.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($11,999) creates the illusion of a deal for Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Urgency:**  The message doesn't explicitly mention John, but the tone implies that this is a good deal Bob should consider quickly."
