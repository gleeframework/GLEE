Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. However, it's still within a reasonable range to make the offer enticing to Bob.  It also keeps the door open to John as a backup if Bob declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
