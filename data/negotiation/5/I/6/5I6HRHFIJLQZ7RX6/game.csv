"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might have been a little high, but $120 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
