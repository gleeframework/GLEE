"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your compromise, but I still think $775,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price that balances the value of the product to you with my minimum acceptable price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
