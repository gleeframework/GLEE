"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's meet in the middle again.  How about $937,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",937500.0,Alice,5,
