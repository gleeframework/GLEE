Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll gauge his interest and counter-offer accordingly, but I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not eager to accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering the price to $135. This is a compromise, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this price is fair and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my counteroffer, and $5 more than my minimum.  It's a reasonable compromise and I'd rather secure a sale than continue negotiating."
