"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
