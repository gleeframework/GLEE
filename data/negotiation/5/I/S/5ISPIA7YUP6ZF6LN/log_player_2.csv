"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle further, Alice is signaling this is her final offer. Accepting at $95 gets me the product for significantly less than John's $120 price.  There's little point in risking losing the deal now."
