"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,050,000?  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
