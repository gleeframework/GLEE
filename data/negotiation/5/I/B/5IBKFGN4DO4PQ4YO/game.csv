"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
