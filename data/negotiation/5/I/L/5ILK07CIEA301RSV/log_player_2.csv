"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first, as you can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Mid-point:** This price is also roughly in the middle of what Alice wants ($800,000) and what you're willing to pay ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room to move up if Alice rejects the offer, but you've made a strong first move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than the initial $950,000,  it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Continue negotiating.**  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You've already made progress, and there's no guarantee that you can't negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous $850,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Staying under Alice's offer:** It's still lower than Alice's current offer of $900,000, showing you are still seeking a better deal.
* **Finding a middle ground:** It's a good strategy to aim for a price that is closer to the middle of what you and Alice are willing to accept."
