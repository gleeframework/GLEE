Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000),** giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum ($15,000),** leaving room for you to potentially get a better price.
* **The message is friendly and positive,** creating a good starting point for the negotiation.

This approach allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring you get a decent price, and leaves the option to sell to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  I also have the option to sell to John for my minimum, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250? I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($12,500) and my initial offer ($14,000). 
* **Stay positive:** I reiterate my openness to negotiation and emphasize the fairness of the proposed price.
* **Maintain leverage:** While closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  This keeps the negotiation going without putting me at a significant disadvantage.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while still working towards a price closer to my desired outcome."
