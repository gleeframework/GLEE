"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a good deal from Alice, or you can always buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13250? I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your maximum but still a bit higher.  It's likely you can continue to negotiate down, but there's no guarantee you'll get to your desired price.  It's best to lock in the $12,000 price with John and avoid further potential negotiation."
