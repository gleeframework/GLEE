"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go a little further. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I'm confident will be profitable for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
