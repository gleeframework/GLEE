Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price that's significantly higher than your minimum but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to pay less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent price, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial asking price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my price a bit to $105, which is still a fair amount more than Bob's offer but shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, I'm not willing to sell for $80.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'll offer $98, which is closer to Bob's offer but still a bit above his last counteroffer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about selling and willing to meet him halfway."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $92 is getting close to my desired range.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
