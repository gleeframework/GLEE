"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
