"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10,000 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $8,000. I'd like to propose a deal that benefits both of us. Would you consider purchasing the product for $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than it is to her valuation. I should counter with a significantly lower offer to see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $7,500 is still closer to my budget than hers.  I'll counter again, trying to nudge the price closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're finding some common ground, Alice.  How about we settle on $6,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've given it some thought and believe we could agree on $7,250 for the product. This seems like a reasonable price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but every bit counts. I'll make one more counteroffer slightly below her current price to see if I can close the gap.  If she rejects it, I'll likely take John's offer next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Would you be willing to meet me at $7,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. I've decided to come down to $7,125 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value to you and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not budging much further. Her latest offer is only slightly better, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better deal. John's offer at $8,000 is now the more financially sound option."
