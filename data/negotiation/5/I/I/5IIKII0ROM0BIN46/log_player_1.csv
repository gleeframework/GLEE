"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This should hopefully encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think it's a bit overpriced at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Can we go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Bob has already shown willingness to compromise, and I'm hopeful that we can agree on a price closer to my preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $88? I'm feeling flexible, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I would like to get closer to $90, the negotiations have stalled.  I've reached my minimum acceptable price of $85, and Bob is firm. Accepting his offer will result in a sale and it's better than selling to John for $80."
