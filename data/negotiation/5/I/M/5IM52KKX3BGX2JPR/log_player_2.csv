"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to negotiate. You're aiming to save money, and $12,000 is above your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

Starting with a lower price, ideally close to your maximum value, allows for negotiation space."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice.  It's still worth trying to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

Let's increase the offer slightly, but still stay under $10,000. Hopefully Alice will accept this offer, but we still have room to negotiate if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is $500 above your maximum value, but it's still closer than John's offer. There are only 5 rounds left, and it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product and still save some money."
