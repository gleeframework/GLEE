"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is 20% higher than Bob's value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations.  I'm confident that I can get at least $10,000 from John if the negotiations with Bob fail, so I can be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's initial offer.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  I'm also starting to get concerned about losing too many rounds, so I'm willing to be more flexible at this point."
