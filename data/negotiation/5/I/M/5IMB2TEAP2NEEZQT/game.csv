"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1300000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1300000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1150000.  This would allow both of us to come away with a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference once more and go with $1200000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would save me from having to go elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
