"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000?  This gives us both room to negotiate and still allows me to get a fair price for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to go to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that lets us both benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
