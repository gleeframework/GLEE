Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000?  This gives us both room to negotiate and still allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to go to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that lets us both benefit from the deal. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
