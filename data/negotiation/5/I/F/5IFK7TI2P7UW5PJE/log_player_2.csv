"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a decent price, you're aiming for the best deal possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $10 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better price. I'm leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice needs to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  That's still a great value for this product, and it gives us both a win-win. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not willing to pay $130.  I'm holding out for a better deal. I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept.  I can always buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, I'm still aiming for $125.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $125. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm hoping a persistent approach will get her to agree. I'm keeping my message positive and emphasizing fairness to maintain a good relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but I'm also trying to make sure I get a fair deal for my product. Let's meet halfway at $127.50. This shows good faith on both sides and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly and is now offering $127.50, which is only $7.50 more than my target price of $120. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a decent price and avoids having to buy from John."
