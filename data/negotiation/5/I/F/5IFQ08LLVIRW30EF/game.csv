"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see value in the product, that price is a bit too high for me.  I would be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $700,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
