"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see value in the product, that price is a bit too high for me.  I would be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, it's still above our ideal and John's offer. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $700,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and we know we can get it for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal."
