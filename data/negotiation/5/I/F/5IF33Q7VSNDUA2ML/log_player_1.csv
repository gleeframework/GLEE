Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at and what it's worth to him. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer represents a significant value proposition given the potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting $950,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 for the product. This takes into consideration your budget constraints while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",

We are getting close, but I believe I can still get Bob closer to $1 million.  I am willing to play hardball as I am confident in the product's value. I will counter-offer again."
