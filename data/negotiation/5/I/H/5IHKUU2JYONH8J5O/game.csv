"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit below $15,000. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is close, but I need to get at least $14,500 for this to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",14500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,,
