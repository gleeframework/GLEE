{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I've also included a friendly message to establish rapport and highlight the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, so it's in my best interest to accept his offer.  I'll avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
