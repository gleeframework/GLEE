"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's high, but still potentially appealing to Bob, given his estimated value.  It also allows me to gauge his interest and potentially see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a good price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always choose to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value you're placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $950,000 is still below my threshold. I have 6 rounds remaining, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about $1,050,000?  This offer reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value you're placing on the product. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is a lot closer to my minimum than before, I'm still hesitant to accept. I have 4 rounds left and John is still an option. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $990,000. I believe this is the maximum I can go without compromising my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $990,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I have 2 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. John is still an option, but I'm willing to risk it for a potential higher payoff with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both reaching our limits. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum. It reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my maximum limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to offer $995,000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is offering $995,000, which is very close to my minimum, I'm not willing to compromise any further. I've already made significant concessions, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of losing the deal with John for a slightly lower price."
