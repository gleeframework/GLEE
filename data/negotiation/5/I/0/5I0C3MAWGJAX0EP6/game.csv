"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a solution.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $12,100 as my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",12100.0,Bob,6,
