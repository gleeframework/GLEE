"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $12,000 on it. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. Looking forward to your response.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I still feel that $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to stick to my original proposal of $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a little hesitant at $9,500.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
