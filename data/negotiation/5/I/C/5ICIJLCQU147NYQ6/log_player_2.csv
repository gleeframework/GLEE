"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're willing to sell it for $75 today. Don't miss out on this great opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first.  We have room to negotiate before hitting our $80 max."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $75 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $65 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better, we're still aiming lower. Let's counter-offer and see if we can meet closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $62.50?"",
""product_price"": 62.50
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her $65 and our previous offer of $60. This shows willingness to compromise but holds firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your offer, how about we agree on $63 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle. $63 is a solid discount, and continuing to haggle might risk the deal. It's a good price, so let's accept."
