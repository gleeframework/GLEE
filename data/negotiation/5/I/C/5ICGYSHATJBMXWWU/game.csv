"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. This offer reflects a fair price considering its potential and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point, especially considering the benefits it offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I need to be upfront: $950,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product. It's truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return. Let's make this work â€“ how about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
