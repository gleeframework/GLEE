"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific situation."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high initial agreement. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By anchoring the initial price high, we set a favorable tone for the subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. This offer reflects a fair price considering its potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,000,000) and his perceived value ($1,200,000).  It's clear there's a wide gap to bridge, but we have time to negotiate.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our fallback, not our goal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point, especially considering the benefits it offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:**  We want to signal that we're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss.  Meeting exactly halfway demonstrates fairness while staying above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  By mentioning the product's benefits specifically for Bob, we reinforce his perceived value and justify our counteroffer. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  We're proposing a specific number to keep the negotiation moving forward with purpose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below our $1,000,000 threshold.  We've shown a willingness to negotiate, and now it's time to hold firmer to encourage him to move closer to our acceptable range. We're not desperate enough yet to accept his low offer or John's backup offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I need to be upfront: $950,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product. It's truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return. Let's make this work â€“ how about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding strong at our absolute minimum price ($1,000,000) but presenting it as a compromise to entice Bob.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and signals that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. This might encourage Bob to take the deal or negotiate more seriously.
* **Focus on Value:** We reiterate the potential return on investment, subtly reminding Bob why the higher price is justifiable."
