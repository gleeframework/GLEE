"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this work for me. How about $875,000?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I still feel that $875,000 is quite high. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $750,000. However, if you could meet me halfway, say at $825,000, I'd be willing to consider that.",825000.0,Bob,4,
