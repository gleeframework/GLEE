"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $100 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $120 to you, Alice's offer of $100 is still above your target. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If you can't reach a better agreement with Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that benefits both of us. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to accept $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your range:**  $95 is below your maximum price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While you could try to negotiate further, you've made progress, and there's a risk of losing the deal.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** You can always purchase from John if this deal falls through. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this stage, as it secures the product at a reasonable price within your budget and without further risk."
