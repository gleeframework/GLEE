{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. It also implies that you're open to discussion, which is key for a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product ($8,000). I'm not willing to sell it that low. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial asking price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could lead to an even lower price. I'm confident I can get my minimum value from John, so I'll sell the product to him."
