"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's compromise at $1,125,000. This is a fair midpoint that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,105,000 is still just a little too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,115,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",1115000.0,Alice,5,
