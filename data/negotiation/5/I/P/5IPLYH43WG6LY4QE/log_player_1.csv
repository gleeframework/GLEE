"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to push for a higher price. While $1,100,000 is still good, I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's compromise at $1,125,000. This is a fair midpoint that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,105,000. Can we compromise on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,105,000 is close to my bottom line, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to $1,125,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,105,000 is still just a little too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,115,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,107,500. Can we compromise on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,107,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,107,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. Accepting his offer for $1,107,500 is still a decent profit and  it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000. The risk of continuing negotiations is that I might not reach a better price, and could end up with nothing. It's time to secure the sale."
