"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product represents significant value and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $15,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we settle on $13,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still working for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $13,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
