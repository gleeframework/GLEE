Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $15,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

}
``` 

While getting $15,000 from John is ideal, Bob's offer of $11,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly more than his initial offer, and continuing negotiations might not yield a much better outcome. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate."
