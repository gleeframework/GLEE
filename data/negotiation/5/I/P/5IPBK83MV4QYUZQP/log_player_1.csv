Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial proposal. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.
