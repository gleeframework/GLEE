Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone down to $90 from my initial offer of $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think $85 is a fair compromise. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It makes the most sense to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
