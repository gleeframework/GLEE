Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently offering prices significantly below my minimum ($15,000).  His latest offer of $16,500 suggests he's unlikely to meet my valuation. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting an even lower offer, or letting the deal fall through entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
