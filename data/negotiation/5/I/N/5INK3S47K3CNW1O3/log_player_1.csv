"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and I believe I can potentially get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not in a rush, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal,  I'm ready to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm eager to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
