Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (John's offer)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $1,500,000
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm aiming for a price in the middle ground. Offering $1,200,000 gives me a significant profit over my minimum, while also leaving room for Bob to negotiate a lower price if he wants.

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still ensuring I receive a good price for my product."
