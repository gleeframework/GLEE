"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal.  Let's try to find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm motivated to close this deal, but need to be realistic about the product's worth. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is a significant step forward for me and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,
