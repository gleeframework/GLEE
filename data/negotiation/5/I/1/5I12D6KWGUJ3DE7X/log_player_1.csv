Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This puts you in a strong position.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high asking price ($1,000,000) sets the anchor high and leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate downwards. The key is to start high and leverage your strong position."
