Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** I've set the price at $119. This accomplishes two things:
    * It's still a profit for me, exceeding my minimum price of $120.
    * It's attractive to Bob, as it's just below his perceived value of $100, potentially incentivizing him to buy. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for me."
