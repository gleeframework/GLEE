"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are only willing to pay up to $150. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  However, it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  By offering $140, you show Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay less than her asking price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** $140 is still a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential compromises in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your desired price, you are still willing to pay up to $150.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating.** You might be able to get Alice to lower her price further. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** However, you're still within your negotiation window, so it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:**  You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price. Increasing your offer to $145 demonstrates flexibility while still staying within your budget.
* **Stay close to your limit:**  You're getting closer to your desired price, but still leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This keeps the pressure on Alice and gives you more opportunities to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close, but still above your limit.** While $155 is getting closer to your desired price, you're still willing to pay up to $150.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal.** You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has been lowering her price. There's still a chance you can get her to come down further.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the best choice yet.**  You're close to reaching your desired price, and with a few more rounds, you might be able to close the deal with Alice for less than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your maximum price, and you've shown flexibility throughout the negotiation. 
* **Leaving no room for further negotiation:**  By offering your final price, you put the decision entirely on Alice.
* **Close to the deal:**  If Alice accepts, you get the product at your desired price. If she rejects, you can buy from John without losing any more time."
