"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you! I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** This is a good starting point, as it's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:** Starting with a positive and conversational tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning that you believe the product is worth a lot to Bob can subtly encourage him to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than John's offer of $80, it's still below your desired profit margin. You want to maximize your earnings, so rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering gives you a chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  However, $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with rationale:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, you're offering a counter-proposal with a reason. This shows that you're open to negotiation and willing to compromise. 
* **Splitting the difference:**  Proposing $95, the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's, demonstrates that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasis on value:**  You're reiterating that $95 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. This price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to your ideal price point and is significantly higher than John's offer of $80. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or the need to sell to John."
