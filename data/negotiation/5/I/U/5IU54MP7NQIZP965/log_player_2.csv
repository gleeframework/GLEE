"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you! I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  However, $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay $120, so there's still a potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. This price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
