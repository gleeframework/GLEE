"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is very competitive. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good start, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $1,050,000 is a good price for Bob. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiations and potentially getting stuck with the higher price from John."
