Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've added a 18.75% markup on your minimum price, aiming to maximize profit while leaving some room for negotiation. 

It's important to consider:

* **Bob's potential budget:**  If you have any knowledge about Bob's financial situation, adjust the price accordingly.
* **The value of the product:**  If you believe the product is truly exceptional and worth more than $9,500 to Bob, you could offer a higher price.

Remember, this is a strategic game. You need to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting your offer and you ending up with only $8,000."
