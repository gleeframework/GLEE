"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really eager to get this product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $115. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about I meet you at $112.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
