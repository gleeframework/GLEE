"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't reflect the true value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point strikes a balance between our respective valuations.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've been giving this offer serious thought, and to be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can reach an agreement.  Would you be willing to consider $2,050,000?  This would allow me to pass on the other offer and solidify our deal.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm not willing to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer. I believe this is the highest price I can pay and still make a reasonable profit. Please consider it.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
