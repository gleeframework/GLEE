Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
