"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding that amount. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's wrap this up. How about $885,000?  That's my final offer.",885000.0,Alice,5,
