"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money and achieves your goal of acquiring the product."
