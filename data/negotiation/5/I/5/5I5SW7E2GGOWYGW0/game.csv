"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go below $120. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you at $110, which is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. How about we split the difference and settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll meet you at $100. This is the best I can do.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $80, which is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll make one last offer: $110. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,9,
