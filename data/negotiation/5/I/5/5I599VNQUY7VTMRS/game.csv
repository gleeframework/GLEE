"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
