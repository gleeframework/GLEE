{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a decent profit, while also giving Bob a potential discount compared to what he'd be willing to pay.  This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also allows me to quickly move to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for such a low offer right away.  I'll counteroffer to try to find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is acceptable. It's above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $15,000.  This allows me to move forward with the sale and avoid any further negotiation."
