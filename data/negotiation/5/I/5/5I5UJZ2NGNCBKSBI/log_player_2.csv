"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that will satisfy both of our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good deal, but there's a chance you can get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or see if she'll come back with a better offer. You always have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so you don't risk losing the product entirely."
