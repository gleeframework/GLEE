"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know if that's something you're interested in.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $17000?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $18000.  This is a fair price for us both and allows me to stay within my limit.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $18500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
