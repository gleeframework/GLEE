"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price, and still gives you a good margin for profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's minimum asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still within Bob's budget of $800,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not budge much more. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might result in a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
