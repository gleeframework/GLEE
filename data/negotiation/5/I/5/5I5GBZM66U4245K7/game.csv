"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price, and still gives you a good margin for profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
