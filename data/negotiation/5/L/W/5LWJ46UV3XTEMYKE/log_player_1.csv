"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer doesn't leave any room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 8 rounds and the option to sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $17,000. This is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $15,000 and is a reasonable price given the negotiation process. It's also only one round away from my desired $17,000.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer."
