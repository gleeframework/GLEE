"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still very confident in the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still unable to move beyond $12000 due to my financial constraints. I believe we've reached our maximum point of agreement. I will proceed to purchase the product from John at $12000.",12000.0,Bob,4,
