"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it has for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
