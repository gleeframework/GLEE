I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,500 is too low for me at this point, especially since I know it's worth more to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is now at the same price that John is willing to pay.  I don't want to risk going lower and losing out on a guaranteed sale. I'll sell to John."
