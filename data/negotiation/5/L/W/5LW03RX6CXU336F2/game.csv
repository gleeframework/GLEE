"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. This is a one-time deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its potential value to you.
