Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my $8,000 goal, Bob's offer is still within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out to John."
