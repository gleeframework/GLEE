"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much more than I'm willing to pay and significantly above John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still too high. I'm aiming to spend closer to John's price. It's worth it to see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I still have some room to negotiate. I'll try one more time to get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,100? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 8100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,150. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses. I can buy the product from John for $8,000 and save myself the further negotiation hassle."
