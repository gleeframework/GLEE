"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Could you do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a good product, but I'm on a budget.  $1,250,000 is too high for me. My absolute best offer is $1,175,000.  If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
