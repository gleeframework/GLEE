"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. This will likely lead to a negotiation, but I'm confident I can secure a good price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap towards my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it above Bob's initial counteroffer. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price point, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
