"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me see if I can find some wiggle room. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
