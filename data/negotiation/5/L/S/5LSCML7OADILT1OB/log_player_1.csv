"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, given its value to you, and allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:** He values the product at $1,000,000, so this is a $50,000 saving.
* **It's above your minimum:**  This ensures you still get a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go lower if needed, but starting high gives you more bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $820,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a worthwhile profit.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a better price and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I am willing to offer $870,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $870,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the profit I need to make. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on the value I see in the product and the negotiations we've had, I am willing to pay $880,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $880,000 is still slightly below my desired price, it's getting very close to my minimum. I've already rejected Bob's previous offers, and I'm concerned that if I continue to reject, he might either walk away completely or become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit that's close to my minimum, which is crucial considering the time constraint of the negotiation."
