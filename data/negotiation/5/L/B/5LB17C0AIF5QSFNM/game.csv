"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to find a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,050,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $1,075,000?  I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
