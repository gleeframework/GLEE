"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your product's worth of $800,000, it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John at $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Alice is offering a ""significant discount,"" there might be room to negotiate further.  However, accepting the offer gives you a starting point for a potential negotiation."
