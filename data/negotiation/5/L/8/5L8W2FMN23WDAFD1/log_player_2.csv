Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your perspective. However, given the unique value and quality of our product, I cannot agree to the proposed price of $1500000. Our current valuation remains at $2000000. I am willing to negotiate and consider a price closer to $1750000. This still reflects a significant discount from our original asking price while acknowledging the value you see in the product. Let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.
