Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still significantly above John's standing offer.  It's too early to settle for anything below $1,300,000. We'll apply more pressure in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I wouldn't be offering it below its value.  To move this forward, I'll come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you see its worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally inched above John's standing offer. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him in subsequent rounds, the risk is that he might dig in at $1,050,000 or even lower his offer. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit above our guaranteed sale to John."
