Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $11,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $16,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet you at $13,500 to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,500. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm thinking we could meet at $13,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,250.  While you might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of her in the last round, it's very risky. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Saving an additional $3,250 is worth cutting off the negotiation now."
