"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $11,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $16,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I could stretch my budget to $12,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its current market value.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $12,500? It's a fair compromise and would allow me to close the deal today.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet you at $13,500 to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been tough but fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $13,000?  This would allow us to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,500. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm thinking we could meet at $13,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",13250.0,Alice,9,
