"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $120 from John, so it's not worth paying $140 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not worth paying more than $120. Since you can buy the product from John for that price, that's the best option."
