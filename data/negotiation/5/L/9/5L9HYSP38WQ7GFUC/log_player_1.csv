Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you want to offer the product at a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, leaving him with a small gain and you with a larger portion of the potential surplus.

By offering the product at $90, Bob is still getting a $10 discount ($100 value - $90 price) and you are maximizing your profit by getting $10 more than your minimum selling price."
