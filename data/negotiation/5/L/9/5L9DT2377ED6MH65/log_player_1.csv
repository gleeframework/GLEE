"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good portion of the value Bob sees in the product. I'm not going all the way to $1,500,000, as I want to leave room for negotiation and still get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is more than what John is offering, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still trying to maximize my profit.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product, and this counteroffer is still significantly higher than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's only a bit less than what John is offering, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a higher price than $850,000 by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer again, but still keeping it above John's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $25,000 higher than what John is offering.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal for a slightly higher price.  I'll take the $825,000 and move on."
