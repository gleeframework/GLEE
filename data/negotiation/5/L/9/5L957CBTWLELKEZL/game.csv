,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still not able to meet the price of $975,000. Could we perhaps aim for $960,000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise and still allow me to stay within my budget.",960000.0,Bob,4,
