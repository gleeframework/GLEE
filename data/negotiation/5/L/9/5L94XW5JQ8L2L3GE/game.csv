"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. This is a great deal considering its true worth. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still being within your budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I'm unable to go above $8,500. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $8,500 is still too far below my desired price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $8,750? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. I'm willing to consider $8,600 as a fair compromise between our positions.",8600.0,Bob,6,
