"Thank you for considering my interest in your product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would you be open to discussing a more reasonable price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below its worth.  Would you consider a price of $1,300,000? This reflects a willingness to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, $1,300,000 is still beyond my means. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
