"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is still higher than my preferred price range, I am willing to consider $1,100,000 as a compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
