"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($900,000 vs. $800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to its value to me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still significantly below your maximum price of $1,500,000 and is also a compromise from her previous offer. Accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase at a reasonable price. Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of Alice walking away or having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
