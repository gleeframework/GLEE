"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential for return.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your perspective, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
