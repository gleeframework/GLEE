"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's worth while also allowing us to both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This is a step closer to your offer but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement without sacrificing too much.",9500.0,Bob,4,

This price reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $9,750. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
