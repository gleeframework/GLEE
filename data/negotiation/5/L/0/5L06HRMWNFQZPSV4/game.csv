"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  To be honest, I'm having a hard time justifying going above $11,000. That's my final offer; I hope you can see your way to accepting it.",11000.0,Bob,6,
