Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* The price is higher than what I'd get from John, but it's a good starting point to see how much Bob is willing to pay. 

I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to start a negotiation process."
