"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $11000.  How about $11200?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10800.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $10800 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
