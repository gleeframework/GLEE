"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to own a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of securing a lower price overall.
* **Polite and Interested:** My message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""around $10,000"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Alice to counter-propose and keep the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above John's price. There's still room to negotiate and try to get closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** I'm now stating my maximum price clearly. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth and shows Alice I'm serious.
* **Justification:** Highlighting that $12,000 is a fair compromise reinforces my position and appeals to Alice's sense of fairness. 
* **Ending Point:** By making this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that this is likely my final price. If she rejects it, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price above my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go down to $12,000.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my target price."
