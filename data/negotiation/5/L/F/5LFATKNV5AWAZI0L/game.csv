"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to own a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
