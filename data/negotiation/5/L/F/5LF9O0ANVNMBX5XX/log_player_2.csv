"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your needs. It comes with a range of features that we believe will enhance your experience. Considering its quality and functionality, I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you have a fallback option of buying from John for $100, you can use that as leverage to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the features you mentioned, but $100 is a bit out of my budget right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 20%. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a range where she might be willing to negotiate. I'm also keeping the communication friendly and focused on the value of the product to me."
