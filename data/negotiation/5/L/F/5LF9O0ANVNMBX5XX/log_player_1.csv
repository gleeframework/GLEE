Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the features you mentioned, but $100 is a bit out of my budget right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
