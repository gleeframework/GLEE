{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation while still potentially yielding a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,000,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm not willing to risk losing out on a much better deal with John just to get a slightly higher price from Bob.  I'll sell to John."
