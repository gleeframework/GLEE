Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $130? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $120 is the fair price for this product. I would like to stick to my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  I've been through a few rounds with Bob and it seems like he's unwilling to budge on his price. I'm not comfortable accepting $120, especially with John offering me my minimum price.  It's better to guarantee a good sale than risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
