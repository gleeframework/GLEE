"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but $85 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $77.50? Can you do that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $82.50, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think I can do better than $82.50. How about $79? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",79.0,Bob,6,
