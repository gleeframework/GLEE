Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer of $13,500 is close to my counteroffer and is higher than what John would pay. I'll accept it to close the deal."
