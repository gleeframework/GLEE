"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that we believe could greatly enhance your lifestyle or business. Given its high quality and exclusivity, I'm confident it's worth more than $150 to you. Let's start with an offer of $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you're describing, $200 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you while still valuing our product appropriately. How about we meet in the middle at $150 for the product? This allows us to both reach a fair agreement.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still above my limit. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $125. This is the highest I can go at the moment, so I hope you'll consider it.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. Considering the value and uniqueness of our product, I believe $135 would be a fair compromise. It's slightly above your last offer but still within a reasonable range. Please let me know if this works for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm close to my limit, but I'm willing to go up to $130.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,6,
