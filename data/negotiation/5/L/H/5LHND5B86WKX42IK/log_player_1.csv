"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,400,000. This leaves a significant margin for Bob, while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this will encourage him to negotiate further rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to achieve. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and counteroffering.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a decent price for me. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob while also leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I believe I can still do better. There's still a significant difference between Bob's offer and my ideal price, and I have 6 more rounds to try and close the gap. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,320,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair price given Bob's previous offers, and I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll come up with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. With only 3 rounds left, I want to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum but still aren't meeting my desired price.  Rather than risk losing more time and potentially accepting a price I'm not happy with, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's a secure outcome considering the limited time remaining."
