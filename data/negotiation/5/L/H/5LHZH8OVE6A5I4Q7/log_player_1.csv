Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I still think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170.  This is a small concession, but I want to see if we can close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm likely going to sell to John as the price difference is getting too small to justify further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate. I'll sell to John for $150."
