"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you reaching out.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  I'm very interested in the product and believe this price would be fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
