Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate down from his value of $12,000, but I don't want to give up too much profit in the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, and it's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $9,200 is a good deal and I'm happy to secure the sale. It's above my minimum price of $8,000 and it's likely that further negotiation would just take more time and effort."
