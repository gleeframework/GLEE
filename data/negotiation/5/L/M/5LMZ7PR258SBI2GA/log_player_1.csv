``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product. 

Let's see how he responds and then we can adjust our strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. It's too early to settle for the minimum. I will try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500, given your enthusiasm for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $16000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum and worth the risk of potentially losing him as a buyer."
