"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,600,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and the product's true value to me. Bob's offer indicates he's seriously interested, so there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,600,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go lower than $1,950,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving while still targeting a price that's significantly above Bob's valuation and closer to my own. This counter-offer shows flexibility on my part but also maintains the perceived high value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated to purchase. However, $1,750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To be completely transparent, my absolute bottom line is $1,850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm moving closer to a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" stance by revealing a near-final price.  This emphasizes the value I place on the product while still allowing room for Bob to accept or propose a final counter-offer.  The goal is to secure a deal above my minimum acceptable price within the next couple of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's latest offer is still significantly below my stated bottom line. It seems unlikely he'll bridge the gap to $1,850,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation poses a risk of losing both Bob as a buyer and the guaranteed offer from John.  Therefore, the most logical decision is to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, securing a guaranteed return that meets my minimum requirement."
