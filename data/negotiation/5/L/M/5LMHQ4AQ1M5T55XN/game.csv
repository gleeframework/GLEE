"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,600,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go lower than $1,950,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000. Can you consider this price?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To be completely transparent, my absolute bottom line is $1,850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
