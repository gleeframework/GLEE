"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you've mentioned you value it at $10,000. If you're not interested, I'm happy to sell it to John for $10,000, but I'd rather see you benefit from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a terrible deal for you!  You'd be paying $1,000 more than your maximum and what John would sell it for.  She's trying to bluff you into thinking it's a good deal."
