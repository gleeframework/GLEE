"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go beyond $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a great product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
