"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000  as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
