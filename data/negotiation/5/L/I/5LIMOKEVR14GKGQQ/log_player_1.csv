**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small incremental increases in his offers and is unlikely to meet the desired price point.  At this stage, continuing negotiations with Bob risks leaving money on the table. Selling to John guarantees the full value of $1,200,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current trajectory."
