"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. After considering its value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but given my financial constraints, I cannot agree to $2,050,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
