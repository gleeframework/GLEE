Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys from you.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (lower than $1,500,000) but also maximizes your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and represents a significant opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone encourages Bob to engage in a conversation, increasing the chances of a deal.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to achieve the highest likely profit while considering Bob's potential counter-offers."
