Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum value of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You state your offer directly and invite Bob to respond.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired price range. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John, and it's close enough to your desired price that it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate may lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely."
