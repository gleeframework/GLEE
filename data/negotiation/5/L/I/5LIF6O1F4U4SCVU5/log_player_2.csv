"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs. This product holds immense value to me, but I believe it would be an even greater asset in your hands. I am offering this remarkable item to you at a special price of $900000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the intrinsic value of the product and my desire to see it go to someone who will appreciate it fully. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

* **Buying from John will cost you $1,000,000.**  
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000.** 

While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the most financially beneficial option in this situation."
