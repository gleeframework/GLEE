"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, but I'm aiming for the best possible deal. I'm curious to see Bob's reaction and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum value, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is my minimum price point, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to negotiate closer to this number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to drop my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too far below my minimum value, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. To avoid the chance of losing out altogether, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
