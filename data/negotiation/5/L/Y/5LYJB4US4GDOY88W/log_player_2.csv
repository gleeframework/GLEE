"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant discount and gives you a great head start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and further negotiation is the best way to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but  $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that should still be very attractive to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a good chance that Alice won't go lower, and Bob risks losing the deal to John.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
