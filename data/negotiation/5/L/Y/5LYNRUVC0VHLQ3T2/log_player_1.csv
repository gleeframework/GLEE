"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals to Bob that you believe the product is valuable and you are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the product's value to Bob and what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to the value of the product to Bob. This shows that I am willing to negotiate, but I am also firm on my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still not close to what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show that I'm flexible.  However, I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's last offer. We're getting closer to a possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to what I want, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm getting close to Bob's last offer, but I still believe I can get a bit more.  This counteroffer shows that I am serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for less than I think the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a very good price, almost close to my target price.  With only a couple of rounds left, it is not worth risking a rejection and being forced to sell to John for a much lower price. I'll accept Bob's offer."
