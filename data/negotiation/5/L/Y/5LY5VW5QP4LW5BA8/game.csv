"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,600?  That would be a great price for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,600 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,700, which is my absolute lowest price. This is the best deal I can offer.",8700.0,Alice,5,
