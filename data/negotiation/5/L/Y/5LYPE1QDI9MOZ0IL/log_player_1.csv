{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to explore if Bob is willing to pay closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as he is willing to pay more than your floor price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, given my budget, I'm unable to meet at $110. Would it be possible to consider $105 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $105 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit. You can try to push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
