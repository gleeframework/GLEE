"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering at $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $82 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept it.  I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $100 without exploring all options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm counter-offering at $88.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob before I have to settle with John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Even though I'd prefer to get more than $100,  Bob is now offering his maximum value of $80.  I've reached the point where I need to accept a deal and moving forward with Bob will only result in more rounds of negotiation, potentially pushing me closer to my minimum and risking a worse outcome.  John offers a guaranteed deal at a price that meets my minimum, so I'm going to take it."
