Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While we have John as a backup, it's always better to secure the first sale if possible to avoid potential delays.

By offering the product at $14,000, we stand a chance of Bob accepting, giving us a profit of $14,000 instead of the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
