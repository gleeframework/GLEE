"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for your consideration. I believe its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $950,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or at least get closer to my desired price point. Selling to John right now would be a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant savings.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting $875,000 now would mean missing out on the potential for a better deal.  I'll try to push for a price closer to $900,000 in the next round.  Selling to John would be a worse outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However,  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $885,000. This price is fair and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking to save some money, Alice. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal.  Bob's offer of $880,000 is only $5,000 less than my last offer.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept his offer and secure the sale. If I reject his offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll walk away, or we'll run out of rounds.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
