"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $10,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is still acceptable to me while showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can push him to my minimum or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

I'm again making a counteroffer, this time for $10,250.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still being closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this compromise will convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I've already been through five rounds of negotiation and still haven't reached my target.  I don't want to risk wasting more time and potentially getting a worse offer. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
