Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm flexible, I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit.  I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to be firm on what I can accept.  My final offer is $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a very fair price considering the product's true value.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other opportunities, even though I'd prefer to do business with you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she is still very far from your $800,000 limit.  Her latest offer suggests she's unlikely to meet your price range.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000."
