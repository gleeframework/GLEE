"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize profit. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate downwards while still securing a great deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""incredible potential and value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting price"" implies flexibility and openness to Bob's counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value, setting the stage for a potentially profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, we're aiming to maximize profit.  We started high and Bob countered with a significant jump down, indicating potential for negotiation. We'll counter with a price closer to his valuation while still staying above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still representing a significant gain for you."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential gains.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By coming down $100,000, we show flexibility but maintain a strong position above our minimum price.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between maximizing our profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). However, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. We'll make another counteroffer, holding firm but indicating a willingness to make a smaller concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers and I see we're getting closer.  To show my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($25,000) to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Strong Language:**  Using phrases like ""very competitive price"" and ""product of this caliber"" reinforce the value proposition.
* **Urgency:** While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, the tone implies we have other options, subtly creating urgency for Bob to make a deal.

This counteroffer aims to balance firmness with flexibility. We're aiming for a price that's significantly above our minimum while still acknowledging Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While we could try to negotiate for more, we're running out of rounds, and there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer further. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit above our fallback option of selling to John."
