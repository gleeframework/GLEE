{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for improvement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to maximize my earnings.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915,000. I'm getting closer to my budget, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $910,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation isn't going well, and Bob isn't showing any signs of meeting my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk selling too low. It's best to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
