"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your offer of $9000. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to the table.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I can only stretch to $10000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10000. However, I'm not ready to meet you at that price just yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your offer of $10500, but I'm still not ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best deal you'll get.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, as I mentioned before. I'm hoping you can reconsider and accept this price.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made a final decision to stand firm on my previous offer of $11200. I've already made several compromises, and I don't want to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse. However, I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $11200, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",11200.0,Alice,9,
