,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $10000 for this product. How about $10500?  That's a fair price considering the value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $10500 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
