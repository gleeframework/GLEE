"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is way too high for Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than the initial offer, it's still over his budget.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $12,500 is still over Bob's budget, and it's likely that further negotiations will not lead to a price he can afford. John offers a price that is within Bob's budget, so it makes sense to accept his offer and avoid further haggling."
