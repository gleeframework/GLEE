"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Alice,5,
