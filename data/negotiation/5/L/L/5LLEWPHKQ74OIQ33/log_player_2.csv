"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for cheaper than $100, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However,  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You can still get the product for a lower price than $95. Let's keep negotiating with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $92?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $92 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $93? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is only offering $1 lower than your last offer. It's better to accept her offer and buy the product for $93 rather than risking further negotiation and possibly having to buy from John for $120."
