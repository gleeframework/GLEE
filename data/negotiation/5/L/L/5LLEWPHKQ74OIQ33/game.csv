"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However,  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $92?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $93? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",93.0,Alice,5,
