"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $7000 for it, based on my understanding of its value. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $7000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8200. This is a fair price considering its true value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8200 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $7500, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value.
