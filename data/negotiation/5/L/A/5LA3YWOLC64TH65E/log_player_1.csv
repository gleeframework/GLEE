Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage to not settle for less.
* **Building a Relationship:**  A friendly and positive message helps foster a good relationship, potentially leading to more favorable outcomes in future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would be a major loss.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. There's still a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price in further negotiations.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that considers both of our interests. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** $9,000 represents a middle ground between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, allowing me to make a profit while acknowledging his needs.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I really think that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still very close to my absolute minimum of $12,000.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss. 
* **Unlikely to Yield More:**  Bob has shown a pattern of making offers at the lower end of his budget. Further negotiations are unlikely to significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $12,000, avoiding the risk of further negotiations with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging negotiations with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities.  

While it's always tempting to try to squeeze a bit more out of a negotiation,  in this scenario, the guaranteed $12,000 from John is the most logical and financially sound choice."
