Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing your willingness to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $92 for it. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $92 is only $3 away from your ideal price of $95.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you much closer to your desired price, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
