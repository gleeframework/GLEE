"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception of greater value for your product. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The high initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. If he's immediately turned off, you know he might be a tough negotiator.
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any cost. 

This initial offer sets the stage for the negotiation and allows you to gather information about Bob's position before proceeding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. It's important to demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of devaluing your product. Proceeding to the next round allows you to counter and work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're aiming for a compromise. This counteroffer shows a willingness to move from the initial price while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces its worth and helps justify the higher price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative and invites further discussion, showing Bob we're aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price. Bob has now moved closer to his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). It's time to push a bit harder and see if you can negotiate him closer to your target. You still have John as a backup, so there's room to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,600,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  The offer of $1,600,000 is a strong move to try and close the deal quickly. It's a significant concession from your previous offer but still comfortably above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Presenting it as your ""final offer"" injects a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider it. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While lower than your previous offers, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's perceived value of the product, meaning he'd still be getting a deal in his mind. 

By setting a firm boundary, you're aiming to either close the deal now or gain a clearer understanding of Bob's true willingness to pay."
