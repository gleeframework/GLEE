"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,600,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
