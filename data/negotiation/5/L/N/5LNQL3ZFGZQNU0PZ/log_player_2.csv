"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is too high, and Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is a logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired range. There are still 7 rounds left, so rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to continue trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is within Bob's budget and only $25,000 more than his last counteroffer.  With 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal to John."
