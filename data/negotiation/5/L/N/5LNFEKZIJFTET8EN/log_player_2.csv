"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $100 is within your range.
* **Negotiation:** It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. You can likely get the product for less than $100.
* **John:** While John is a backup option, it's better to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** By offering $90, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget.
* **Value:**  $90 is a fair compromise, considering your maximum value of $120 and Alice's value of $80.
* **Negotiation:** This counter-offer gives Alice room to accept or make a counter-offer, continuing the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about $95?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $95 is still within your maximum budget of $120.
* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Continuing to negotiate may not yield significant savings.
* **Time:** You're already on round 3.  Further negotiation could risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
