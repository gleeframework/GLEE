"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob an incentive to accept, while also allowing me to potentially get a higher price later in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about $95?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
