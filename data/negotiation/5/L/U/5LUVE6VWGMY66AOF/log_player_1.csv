Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  While I could try for an even higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. Offering $90 makes it very likely he'll accept, as it's still significantly below his perceived value.  
* **John as a Backup:** I always have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
