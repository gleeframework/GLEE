"Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This allows for a significant profit margin for you, while still being a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value to me, while also being more in line with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900000 is a good offer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This leaves room for both of us to gain something positive from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
