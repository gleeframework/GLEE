"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get close to your target, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. How about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to meet you closer to the middle. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit short of the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's worth. How about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
