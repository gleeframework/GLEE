"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $800,000 would be a more reasonable range.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's intrinsic worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price point.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, to be honest, that's still a much higher price point than I had in mind. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $900,000. Let me know if that's something you can consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That offer is getting closer, but to make this deal happen, I'd need it to be around $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,6,
