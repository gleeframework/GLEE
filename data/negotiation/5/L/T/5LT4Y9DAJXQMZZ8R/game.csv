"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
