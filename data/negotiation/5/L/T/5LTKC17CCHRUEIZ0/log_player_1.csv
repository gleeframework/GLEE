# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
