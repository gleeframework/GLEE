"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still allows me a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
