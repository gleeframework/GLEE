"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,500 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit attached to the price, but I really think $13,500 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
