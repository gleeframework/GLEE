Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I am not willing to sell the product for $120. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with a price of $175. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.  I hope this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still below what I initially hoped for, it's now above my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or even no deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
