"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You have a good chance of getting a lower price since Alice wants to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you're still well above your target price of $1,200,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
