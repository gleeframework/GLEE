Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I understand it's a valuable asset for you as well.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Showing Flexibility:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion and willing to compromise. 
* **Keeping John as an Option:** This offer leaves me with the flexibility to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial evaluation, it's still below the $1,500,000 I value the product at. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **Keeping John as an option:**  If Bob becomes too stubborn, I can always sell to John and get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.  This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, so I have room to potentially go lower if needed.
* **Positioning for a final agreement:** The message reiterates my desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal, encouraging Bob to consider a final compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation at this point is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time. I need to secure a deal quickly to maximize my profits.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirement. Selling to John guarantees a profitable transaction. 

While I'd prefer to get the highest possible price, selling to John ensures a reliable and profitable outcome, minimizing the risk of continued negotiation with Bob."
