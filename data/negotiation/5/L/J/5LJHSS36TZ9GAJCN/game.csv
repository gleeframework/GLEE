"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item at a discounted rate. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your original offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
