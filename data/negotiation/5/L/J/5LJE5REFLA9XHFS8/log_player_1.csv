"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Given its value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price in Bob's mind at a higher level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,"" we subtly justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting the bidding"" and ""what do you think?"" signals our willingness to negotiate.

This strategy attempts to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, we're aiming to maximize profit. Bob's counter-offer, although lower, suggests he's still very interested. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and allows us to gauge his willingness to go higher. We have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  We acknowledge Bob's counter-offer to signal a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic compromise:** Offering a ""meet in the middle"" price seems fair and may be more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain a strong position:** We're still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price. 

We're aiming to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal before Bob loses interest or we need to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we meet at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $1,600,000 is a substantial profit margin over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation momentum:** Bob is clearly still interested and willing to negotiate, but his increments are getting smaller.  
* **Time factor:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob disengaging increases. 

It's time to secure a very good deal rather than risking losing a significant profit by pushing too hard."
