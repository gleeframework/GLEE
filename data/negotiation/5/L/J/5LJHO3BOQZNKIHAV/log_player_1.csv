"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to your desired range. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""potential,"" you provide a vague but positive reason for the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling your willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, the high starting point increases the likelihood of a final price exceeding $1,500,000.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how interested he is and how much negotiating power he perceives to have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have ample room for negotiation and rounds left.  Selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant investment for you, I understand, but it represents a fair deal given the long-term value this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's perspective helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While moving down from your initial price, the decrease is substantial enough to signal negotiation but not so drastic that it undermines your product's value.
* **Reiterate Value:** Focusing on the ""long-term value"" reminds Bob of potential benefits and justifies the price without revealing specifics.
* **Target Zone:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a range above your minimum while leaving room for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
