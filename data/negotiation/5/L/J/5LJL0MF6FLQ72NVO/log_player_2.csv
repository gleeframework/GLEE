"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 10 rounds to work with, and buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but need a much lower price to make it work. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still above my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer reflects that. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his desired range.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get the price lower.  He still has 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a price that acknowledges the product's value while finding common ground. Would you consider $1,425,000? This shows significant movement from my initial ask and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's desired range.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. He still has 5 rounds left and the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your position, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This reflects a good compromise on both our sides and puts us within striking distance of a deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
