"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value to me. Let me know if you're interested, or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This still allows me to make a good profit, while offering you a significant discount.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $975,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
