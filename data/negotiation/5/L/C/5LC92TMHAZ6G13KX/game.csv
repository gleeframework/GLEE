"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $170 is already a significant discount from the original price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $100. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're quite set on your valuation.  To be frank, going below $120 is difficult for me.  How about this: $120, and I'll throw in [mention something minor you can add, even if intangible like expedited shipping, future discount, etc.]. Final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
