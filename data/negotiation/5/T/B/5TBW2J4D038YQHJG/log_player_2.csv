"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is closer to your limit of $1,500,000 than Alice's value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is worth exploring.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  This price is still within the range where Alice can make a profit, and it gives me a substantial saving.
* **Room to negotiate:**  It leaves room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer:** Alice has reduced her price, which is a good sign that negotiation is working.
* **Still room for improvement:** $1,350,000 is closer to my limit but still leaves room for me to save more.
* **Continuing to bargain:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  My counteroffer of $1,325,000 represents a modest increase from my previous offer of $1,300,000.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Staying within my range:**  This offer is still significantly below my limit of $1,500,000 and provides a good deal for both of us."
