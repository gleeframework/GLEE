"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $17,000, which is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $15,000. This is my absolute top limit, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at $17,000, Bob, but I'm willing to try one more time. I'll counter with $16,500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to stand firm on my offer of $15,000.  If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,8,
