Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market trends. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to wear me down and get the price as low as possible.  He went lower than his ""meet in the middle"" offer from round 4, indicating he's willing to play a tough game. I need to hold firm to signal I'm serious about the value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  I want to be upfront - I have other interested parties. My final offer is $1,260,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply some pressure.  By mentioning other buyers and making a firm final offer, I'm hoping Bob will recognize the risk of losing the deal and accept.  This price is still a significant profit, and it avoids dragging the negotiation out further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your urgency, but I'm not willing to meet your final offer. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,260,000. My final offer is $1,230,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,230,000 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Bob is playing hardball and might not budge much higher. Risking the deal for a marginally better price isn't worth it. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate capital.  Prolonging negotiations delays access to these funds. 
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,230,000 is still a significant profit margin ($230,000 over the minimum). It surpasses John's offer by a comfortable margin.

Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
