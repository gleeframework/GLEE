"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,050,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects my desire to close a deal with you while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,100,000. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $1,090,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
