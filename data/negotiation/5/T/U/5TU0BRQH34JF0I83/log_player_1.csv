Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate the compromise, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my last offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is unlikely to move from $10,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away and potentially getting even less."
