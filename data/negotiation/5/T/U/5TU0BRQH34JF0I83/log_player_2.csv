"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's clear you need to bring the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a clear boundary and shows my willingness to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing my budget constraint to add weight to my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway â€“ would you consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still above my budget of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer gives me more leverage to negotiate a price that works for me. There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from $8,000 to $10,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This is a reasonable middle ground, considering Alice's previous offer of $13,000. I'm also reminding Alice of my budget constraints and emphasizing that I'm making a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? Would $11,500 work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $11,500 is still a bit too high. I'm not comfortable exceeding my $10,000 ceiling yet.  Rejecting this offer will give me another opportunity to negotiate and push for a lower price.  With several rounds remaining, I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate the compromise, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my last offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to the Ceiling:**  I'm reiterating my maximum offer of $10,000.  This shows I'm serious about my budget and not willing to go higher.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the $10,000 as a fair price, suggesting that it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Direct Question:**  I'm posing a direct question to Alice, urging her to consider my offer and make a decision.

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm hoping that Alice will recognize the value of closing the deal and accept my offer."
