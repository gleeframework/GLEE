Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stated this is his final offer. While there's a small chance he might budge a little in further negotiation, it's unlikely he'll come close to the $15,000 John is offering. Accepting Bob's $12,000 would be a $3,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
