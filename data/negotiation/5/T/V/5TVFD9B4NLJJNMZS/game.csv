"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $19,000.  This is a serious offer reflecting the product's worth.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still a long way off from where I'd need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This offer reflects my effort to find a compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $15,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering the value I place on this product and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
