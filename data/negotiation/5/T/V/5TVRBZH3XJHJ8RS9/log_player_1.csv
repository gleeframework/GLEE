Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $9,500 is still below your minimum of $10,000, so you're still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price.

By starting high and leaving space for negotiation, you increase your chances of getting closer to your desired price while still having the option to walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great price for a product worth much more to me, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

This counteroffer offers a few key benefits:

* **Compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Reasoning:** It provides a clear explanation for the counteroffer, making it seem more logical to Bob.
* **Openness:** It leaves the door open for further discussion, making it less likely for the negotiation to break down."
