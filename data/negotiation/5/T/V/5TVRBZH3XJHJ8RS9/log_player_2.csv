"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's still a great price for a product worth much more to me, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a better deal than her previous offer, Bob can secure the product for his desired price by buying from John.  Since saving money is the priority, it's more beneficial to buy from John."
