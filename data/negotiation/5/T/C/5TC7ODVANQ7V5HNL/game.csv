"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $7,500? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
