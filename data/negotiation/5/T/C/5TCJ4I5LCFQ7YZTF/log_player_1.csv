Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but $17,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. How about we split the difference at $16,250? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. While $16,250 is less than my desired price, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate could result in him lowering his offer further, potentially even below John's offer.  Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
