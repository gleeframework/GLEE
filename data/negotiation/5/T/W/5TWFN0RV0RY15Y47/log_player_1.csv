Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $12,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $12,000 gives you a strong starting position. It's significantly below Bob's perceived value but allows for potential negotiation downwards if needed. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $8,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
