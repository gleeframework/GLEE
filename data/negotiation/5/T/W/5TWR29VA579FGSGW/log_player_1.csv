Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $18,000, it hints at the value by mentioning offering it to Bob before a public listing. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You can afford to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or has concerns about the price."
