Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $108. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 108}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $101 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is very reluctant to move above $100.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from him. Taking the guaranteed $100 from John is the best decision at this point."
