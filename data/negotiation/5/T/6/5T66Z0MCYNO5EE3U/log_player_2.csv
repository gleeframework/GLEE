"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm getting a good price and you're getting a product you value highly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, making it a better deal for you."
