"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell this product is important to both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, though.
