"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
