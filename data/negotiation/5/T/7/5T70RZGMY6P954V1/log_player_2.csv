"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Let's try to push Alice a little further down.  We still have room to negotiate before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $11,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $12,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and $12,000 is a good price, saving $3,000 from John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
