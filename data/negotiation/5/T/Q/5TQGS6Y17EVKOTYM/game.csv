"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $75? That would be a great price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love it!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  $90 is closer, but I need to stay on budget.  How about $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which is $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",85.0,Alice,7,
