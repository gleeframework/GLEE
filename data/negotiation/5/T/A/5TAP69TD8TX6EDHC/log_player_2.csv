Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down to $850,000 which is a good price for Bob.  There's always a risk that Alice might come down further, but given the potential for further back and forth and the certainty of $850,000, it's best for Bob to accept."
