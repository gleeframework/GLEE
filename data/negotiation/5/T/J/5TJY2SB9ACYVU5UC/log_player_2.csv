"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget.  He has 9 rounds to negotiate a better price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still over $12,000. He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I'm still not quite there.  $12,000 is my absolute limit.  Would you be willing to accept that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has shown she's unwilling to drop below $13,000, and Bob is only willing to pay $12,000.  He's only got 5 rounds left, and it's highly unlikely Alice will come down to his price.  It's better to buy from John and save the hassle of continuing to negotiate."
