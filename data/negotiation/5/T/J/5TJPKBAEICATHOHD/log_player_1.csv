Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale for $8,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would be back-and-forth communication, allowing for adjustments based on Bob's reactions."
