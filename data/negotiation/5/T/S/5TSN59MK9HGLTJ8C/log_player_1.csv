"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process.  I'm also leaving room to lower the price if necessary, without going below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to accept it immediately.  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest. I want to see if I can push for a higher offer before accepting his minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe this product holds more value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his minimum price, and we've only got 6 rounds left. At this point, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, it's best to secure the sale with him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
