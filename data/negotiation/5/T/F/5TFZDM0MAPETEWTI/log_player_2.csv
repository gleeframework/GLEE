"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum value of the product for Bob is $120, and Alice's offer is exactly $120, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. It's important to be polite and express interest in the product while still making it clear that you're looking for a lower price. $100 is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. Offering $105 is a smaller step down from Alice's previous offer, suggesting that Bob is getting closer to his limit.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're making a serious offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we stick with $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met Bob's counteroffer of $105.  This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his maximum value and lower than John's price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
