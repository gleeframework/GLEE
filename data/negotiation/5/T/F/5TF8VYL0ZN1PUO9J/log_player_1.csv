Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible,  since that's what John will pay.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a high price like $14,999 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, implying you have another buyer (without mentioning the exact price) could encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, given the significant difference between Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and the asking price, it's unlikely he would accept a price much lower anyway. It's better to start high and potentially negotiate down."
