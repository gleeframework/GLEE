Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I anticipate accepting another offer if I don't hear back from you soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much back-and-forth. 
* **Value Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest from others"" subtly implies the product is desirable and worth the higher price.

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach if needed. If he seems turned off by the high price, you have room to decrease it, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000."
