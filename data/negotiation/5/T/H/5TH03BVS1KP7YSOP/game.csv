"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

That's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to say that my initial offer was already a generous one. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'd be willing to go up to $1400000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1550000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, as I mentioned before, and I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
