Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $8,800 is too far below my minimum. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,200?  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go much higher, but I want to try."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,800, and I'll also offer to provide some integration services to help you get started with the product. Would you be willing to accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted by the integration services Bob is offering, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my minimum with him. It's getting too close to my bottom line.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point."
