Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the potential profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value, the message hints at the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always decrease your asking price, but you can't increase it once offered.  Remember, your lowest acceptable price is $12,000."
