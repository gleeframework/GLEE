"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product given its value to him, and this price allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so close to my minimum. I'm going to try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer of $87 guarantees a sale and is a good compromise."
