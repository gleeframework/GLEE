This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob, with a value of $1,200,000, will see this as a good deal and be willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to meet in the middle."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
