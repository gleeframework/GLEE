"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think a fair starting price would be $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $14,000, which is higher than her value of $12,000. This means there is room for negotiation. 
* You have a maximum value of $15,000, so you can afford to try and negotiate a lower price.  

By rejecting the offer, you can explore a counteroffer that might get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While I can't go as low as $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above her value of $12,000, meaning there is still some room for negotiation, but it's getting closer to her limit.
* You are looking to save as much money as possible, and this price is significantly lower than your maximum of $15,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing the price or walking away from the deal is high.  

Therefore, it's more prudent to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that saves you money and is still within your budget."
