"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is valued at $12000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a special price considering its unique features and benefits. I am proposing to sell it to you for $10000. This offer is exclusive and tailored to recognize your appreciation for the product's value. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not impressed with the ""exclusive"" offer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, it's likely that she's making a profit of $2,000. Her offer of $10,000 is still too high for me. I can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is still within my budget of $12,000.
