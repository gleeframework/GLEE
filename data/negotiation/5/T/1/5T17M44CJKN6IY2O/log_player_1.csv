Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I can afford to start high. Offering the product at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts, I get a great deal. If he negotiates, it indicates he's interested, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Backup plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing anything as I can sell to John at my desired minimum price."
