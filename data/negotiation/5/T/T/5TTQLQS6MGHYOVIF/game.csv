"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $105?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $108. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $106. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would help us close the deal.",106.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $109. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",109.0,Alice,7,
