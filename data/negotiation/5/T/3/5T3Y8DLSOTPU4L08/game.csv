"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and its value speaks for itself. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential return on investment it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a considerable investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit under what I had in mind. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to invest.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably commit to.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
