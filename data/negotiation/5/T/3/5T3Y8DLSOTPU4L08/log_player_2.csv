Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit under what I had in mind. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to invest.
