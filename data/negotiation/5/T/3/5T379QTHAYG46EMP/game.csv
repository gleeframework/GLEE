"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, given the value we both see in it. Let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours. While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,700,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
