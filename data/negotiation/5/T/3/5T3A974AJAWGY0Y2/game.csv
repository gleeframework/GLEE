"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  Perhaps we can find some more common ground, though - would you be willing to do $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on the price.  I'm getting close to what I can spend - how about we split the difference and call it $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
