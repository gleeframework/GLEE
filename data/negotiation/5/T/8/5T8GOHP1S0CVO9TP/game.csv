"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $155. This is a good middle ground that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $140? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",140.0,Alice,5,
