"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,750. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $8,000. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground at $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to his $8,000 limit as possible. While Alice has lowered the price, $9,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a price even closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,250 is still a bit out of my range.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a great price for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated she won't go lower than $9,000, which is still above Bob's desired price. With only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob can negotiate a lower price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure a deal within his budget."
