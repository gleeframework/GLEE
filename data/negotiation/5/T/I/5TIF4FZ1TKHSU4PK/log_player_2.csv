# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's also keen on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and scarcity to pressure you into accepting her offer.  Since you know John will sell it to you for the same price, there's no downside to rejecting Alice's offer. You might even get a better deal from John."
