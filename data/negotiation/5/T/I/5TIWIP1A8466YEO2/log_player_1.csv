**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of our rounds, but Bob's increments are getting smaller.  It's time to push back harder to see if he's truly willing to come closer to a price that makes sense for us."

Round 8

**Reasoning:** Bob has inched up closer, and while it's not our ideal price, we're running out of rounds. Accepting $990,000 now avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures we get a good price, even if it's slightly less than John's offer."
