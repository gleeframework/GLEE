"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount right now to secure it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering my budget. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
