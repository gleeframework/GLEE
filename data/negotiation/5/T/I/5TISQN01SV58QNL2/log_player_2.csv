"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $1,000,000.  It's in your best interest to reject her initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a solid alternative with John, so you're in a good position to drive a hard bargain."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount right now to secure it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed alternative with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering again."

I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
