"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair and competitive offer considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This represents a significant saving for me, while still being a fair price for the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
