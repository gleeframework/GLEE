"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair and competitive offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000).  This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for improvement. It's worth trying to get a slightly better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This represents a significant saving for me, while still being a fair price for the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is only $30,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  Given the limited number of rounds, it's not worth risking getting a worse offer by continuing to negotiate.  This price still represents a significant saving for me compared to buying from John."
