"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to pay that, I think we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $10,500. I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay that, I think we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I've already met you at $11,000 and you're still not willing to pay that. I'm willing to make one last offer of $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
