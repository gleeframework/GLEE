Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $8,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my original price of $11,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?

It's clear Alice is not budging from this price range. It's unlikely she'll go down to $8,000, so it's better to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
