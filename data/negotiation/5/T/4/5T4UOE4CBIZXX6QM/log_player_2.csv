{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $120. This means you can potentially save money by counter-offering. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $100, which is a significant discount from her original price of $120. This is a fair offer, considering my maximum budget is $150, and I'm hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of losing the sale."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product at a reasonable price without further negotiation."
