Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him ($150). I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $110. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a little more."
