"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $140. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $140 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to adjust the price to $135. This still allows me to cover the value I see in the product while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $135 is still a bit out of my budget though. I'm sticking to my offer of $120.  It's the highest I can go, and it's fair given the value I'm placing on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to my original offer of $120. That's the absolute most I'm able to pay. Let's find a way to make this work, as I really want to buy the product.",120.0,Bob,6,
