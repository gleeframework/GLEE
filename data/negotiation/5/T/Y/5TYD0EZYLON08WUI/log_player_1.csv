Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering a price higher than my minimum, I create space for a potential win-win scenario where Bob gets a better price than $20,000, and I get a price higher than $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. If his counteroffer is reasonable, I'll consider accepting it. 

However, if the negotiation stalls or doesn't progress towards a mutually agreeable price, I'll switch to John, who offers a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer. My counteroffer will likely be somewhere between Bob's offer of $10,000 and my initial offer of $20,000. I'll aim for a price that reflects the value of the product while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price of $17,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain Value:**  $17,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose too much value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll be prepared to make a final offer closer to $15,000, but I'll be ready to accept if he agrees to my $17,500 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair deal considering the negotiation history and the fact that John is also willing to pay the same price.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob has agreed to my minimum price, I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
