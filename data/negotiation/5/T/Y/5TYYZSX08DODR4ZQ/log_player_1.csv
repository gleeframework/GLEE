Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is clear and highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but secures a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""significant benefits"" subtly reinforces the value proposition to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could:

* **Start higher:**  Begin negotiations at $1,180,000 and be prepared to negotiate down slightly.
* **Provide a deadline:** Create urgency by setting a timeframe for Bob to accept.

By understanding the negotiation dynamics and Bob's perspective, you can tailor your offer to maximize your chances of a successful sale."
