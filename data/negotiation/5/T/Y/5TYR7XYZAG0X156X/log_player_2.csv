Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I want to try to negotiate a better price.  I can always go with John if I can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  While I am very interested in acquiring this product,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,100,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still within my budget and have several rounds left. I'm confident I can push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to my desired price, but $1,030,000 is still outside of my ideal range. I have a few rounds left and I'm going to push for a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,030,000. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,015,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,015,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,027,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down to a price that is within my budget, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better deal from her.  While it's a little bit higher than I was hoping for, it's still a good deal for me.  If I reject this offer, I risk having to buy from John at a higher price."
