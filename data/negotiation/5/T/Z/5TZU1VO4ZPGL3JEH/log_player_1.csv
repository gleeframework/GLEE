Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The offer is closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the chance of a deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price down slightly, still keeping a profitable margin.
* **Maintain a strong position:** The initial high offer establishes your negotiating strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and well below your initial offer. It's better to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob. While selling to John is an option, it's worth exploring if you can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price. While a counteroffer is possible, it's unlikely to yield a better price. Selling to John guarantees you $800,000, which is your minimum and a safe option given the current negotiation."
