"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $15,000. However, considering the current market conditions and the costs involved in providing this product, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a significant discount compared to the usual price and an excellent opportunity for you to experience the benefits of our product. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's a significant markup from Alice's $8,000 value. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might lead Alice to propose a lower price."
