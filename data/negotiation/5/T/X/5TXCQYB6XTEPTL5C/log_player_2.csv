**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but it's still above my ideal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1350000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1380000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, moving closer to my desired price.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm unsure if she's willing to go lower. At this point, it's better to accept her offer and secure the product for a price that is still within my budget and represents a good deal."
