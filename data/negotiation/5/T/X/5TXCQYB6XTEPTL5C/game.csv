"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its worth no less than $1200000 to me.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a tempting deal. I appreciate you sharing your valuation, it helps me understand the product's worth. However,  $1500000 is a bit high for my budget right now.  I'd be happy to pay $1300000 for the product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1420000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. What do you think?",1420000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1420000 is closer, but I'm still a little over my budget.  I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1350000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1380000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
