Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is the starting point for the negotiation.  Offering the full value upfront gives Bob a good starting point.  It also shows you are serious about selling to him. If he rejects, I can adjust the offer based on his counter-offer.  I also have the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $800,000? I'm confident this is still a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept such a large discount. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000. This price still offers a significant value to you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
