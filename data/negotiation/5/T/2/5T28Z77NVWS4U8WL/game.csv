"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your offer of $800,000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer. I'm getting closer to your asking price, but  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems like we're getting close. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
