"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9750 is a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10100. That's the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",10100.0,Alice,7,
