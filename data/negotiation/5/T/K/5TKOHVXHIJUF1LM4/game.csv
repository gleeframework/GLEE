"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my last offer, as I'm getting close to considering alternative buyers. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
