Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I've done some research and I think it's worth less than what you're asking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. How about we try $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $100. He's incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's trying to get the best deal but is limited in what he's willing to pay. Holding onto the product for a potentially slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting John's offer guarantees you get your minimum acceptable price."
