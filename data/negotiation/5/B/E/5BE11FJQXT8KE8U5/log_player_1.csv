I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  $13,500 is better than $10,000, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get a decent profit, we're nearing the end of the negotiation process. I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly higher price, and I don't want to sell to John for $10,000 unless it becomes absolutely necessary."
