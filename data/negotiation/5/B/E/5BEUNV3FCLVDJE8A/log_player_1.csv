Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, but leaves room for negotiation to ensure a better deal for both of us.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that's fair for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Bob clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to pay close to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  This offer is still higher than what I'd get from John, and reflects my willingness to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
