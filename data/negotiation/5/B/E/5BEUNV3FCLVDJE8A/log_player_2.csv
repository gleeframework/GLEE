```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. Bob can counteroffer and try to get closer to Alice's desired price of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,250, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, and there's always the risk that Alice might walk away or increase her price again."
