Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is signaling that she's unlikely to go much lower.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer of $8,000 is a guaranteed saving of at least $250."
