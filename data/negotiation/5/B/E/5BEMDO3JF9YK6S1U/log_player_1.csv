Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

``` 

While $7,500 is an improvement, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
