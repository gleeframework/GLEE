Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just ""its value"") can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price. You know your minimum is $12,000, so you have some flexibility."
