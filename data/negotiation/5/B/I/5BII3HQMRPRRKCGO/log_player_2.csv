"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to own a truly unique and valuable item. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You're not gaining anything by buying from her."
