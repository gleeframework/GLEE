"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is still too high, and he can get the product for less from John.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  At this point, the price Alice is offering is still too high for Bob.  He is better off getting the product from John for $8,000 and saving $1,500."
