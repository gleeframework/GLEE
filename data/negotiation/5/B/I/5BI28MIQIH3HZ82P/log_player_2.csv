Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've already made a significant concession by offering the product for $850,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $825,000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll offer the product for $875,000. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $875,000, and she's issued an ultimatum.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John for $800,000."
