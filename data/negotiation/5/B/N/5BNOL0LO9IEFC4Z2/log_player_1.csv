Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure that extra profit.

**The Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim high while still making the offer attractive to Bob. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Target Price:**  Don't immediately aim for the full $1,500,000. A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
2. **Justification:**  A brief, plausible reason for your pricing can make Bob more receptive.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable:** $1,400,000 leaves you with a $200,000 profit margin, significantly more than your guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer. This starting point gives you some wiggle room.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing all your knowledge about Bob's valuation. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), adjust your offer and message accordingly.
* **Market Factors:** If there are external factors impacting the product's value, incorporate those into your message."
