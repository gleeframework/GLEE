"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider this lower price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $180 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet at $180. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to my maximum budget of $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $160 for the product. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might miss out on a better offer from someone else. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm sorry to hear that $160 is still too high for me. I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $120. I hope this aligns better with your minimum acceptable price.",120.0,Bob,6,
