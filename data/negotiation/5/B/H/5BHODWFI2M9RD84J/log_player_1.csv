"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also sets the initial expectation for a high-value product.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better price than $16,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm still optimistic about getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $17,000. We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  This is a good outcome, as it's above my minimum and significantly higher than selling to John."
