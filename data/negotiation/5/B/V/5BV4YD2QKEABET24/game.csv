"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1500000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1300000. Can we find a mutually agreeable price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1700000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1500000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll counter with $1550000. Can we find a price that works for both of us?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll counter with $1625000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more serious offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1625000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1750000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.",1750000.0,Alice,9,
