"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above her own valuation. This means there's room for negotiation. We can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering its true value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price, but we can still try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. Her offer is still above her own valuation of $1,000,000, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. We'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. This is the best I can do, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is very close to our counteroffer of $875,000.  We are likely not going to get a significantly better price, and continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away or we will run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer saves us a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
