# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This represents a good compromise and shows my genuine interest in your product. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my bottom line. I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial asking price, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob still has a chance to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already made concessions. While buying from John is always an option, it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for your product. This is a significant offer for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. He's showing a willingness to compromise, but also making it clear that he's not willing to go much higher.  The message is positive and emphasizes that this offer is fair for both sides, encouraging Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $500,000 above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, Bob has already negotiated a significant amount and Alice has shown a strong resistance to going lower.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product at a known price from John, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further potential negotiation headaches."
