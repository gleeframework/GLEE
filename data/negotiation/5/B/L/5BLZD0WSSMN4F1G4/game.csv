"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This represents a good compromise and shows my genuine interest in your product. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my bottom line. I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial asking price, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for your product. This is a significant offer for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
