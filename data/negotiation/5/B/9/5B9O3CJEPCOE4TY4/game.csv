"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? That's a good middle ground, and it allows both of us to get a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,050,000 to $1,000,000, but I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,4,
