"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I believe he'll be willing to negotiate.  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $1,400,000, I still have 9 rounds left. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's original value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will be more enticing for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $1,500,000 and a good compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also willing to buy at my minimum price."
