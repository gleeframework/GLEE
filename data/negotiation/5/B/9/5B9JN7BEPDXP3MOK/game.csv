"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $17,000.  This is a fair offer for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  Let me know!",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500. This is a really competitive offer and as low as I'm willing to go.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be honest, $15,500 is still a bit over my budget.  I could do $14,000, and I think that's a very fair deal.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $14,500?  That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,7,
