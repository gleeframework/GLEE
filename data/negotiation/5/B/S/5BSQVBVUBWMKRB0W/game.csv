"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only afford to pay up to $10000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $12500. Is this something you'd be comfortable with?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet at $12500. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $12500. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession this time, so I'll meet you at $12250. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the concession, I'm still unable to meet at $12250. I would like to propose a price of $11500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,
