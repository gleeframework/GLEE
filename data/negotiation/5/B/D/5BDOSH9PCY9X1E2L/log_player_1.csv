I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but also to be aware that if Bob is too far off in his valuation, it might be best to move on to John and guarantee a sale for $1,500,000."
