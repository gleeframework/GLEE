"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your limit and what you know John will sell it for.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Significantly Below Alice's Offer:** By countering with $8,000, we signal that we're serious but also that Alice's initial offer was unrealistic.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $8,000 is a strong counter, it allows for movement upwards towards our $10,000 limit if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price,  $11,000 is still above both your target price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate by increasing our offer, but we're doing it in a controlled way.
* **Staying Below $10,000:** We're still aiming to get the product for less than our maximum budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a good idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she rejects $9,500, we'll need to decide if it's worth going higher or if we should buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to your limit, but it's time to cut your losses. You can buy the product for $10,000 from John, which is your maximum budget. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk paying more than you need to."
