"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is well within your budget of $150, it's a good deal. Accepting her offer saves you $50 compared to buying from John."
