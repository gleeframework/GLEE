"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,060,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,060,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You've already tried to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the best course of action to go with John.  This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids potentially getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Alice."
