"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  By offering $8,500, Bob is splitting the difference between his ideal price ($8,000) and Alice's offer ($9,000).  This could be a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget of $10,000, and it's closer to his ideal price of $8,000 than Alice's initial offer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he may end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a fair price without risking further negotiation."
