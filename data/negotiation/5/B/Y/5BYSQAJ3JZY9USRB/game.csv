"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair compromise for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit concerned that $825,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my minimum. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,5,,
