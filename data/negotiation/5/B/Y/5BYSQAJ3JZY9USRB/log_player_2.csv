Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal. However, I still need to prioritize my minimum price. I'm willing to consider one more counteroffer, but I need to be at $975,000. Can you meet me there?

It's clear Alice is not going to budge significantly from her $900,000+ asking price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price anywhere near your ideal. It's time to cut your losses and go with John, even if it means paying a bit more."
