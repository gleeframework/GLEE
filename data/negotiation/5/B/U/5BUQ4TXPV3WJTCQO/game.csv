"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go as low as $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",100.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept $100 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so I'm offering $105. This is my best price, but I'm confident you'll love the product!",105.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $102.50, so I'm offering $103.75. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",103.75,Alice,7,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $103.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102.5 and $103.75, so I'm offering $103.125. Can you consider it?",103.125,Bob,8,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $103.12 and $103.56, so I'm offering $103.34. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",103.34,Bob,10,,
