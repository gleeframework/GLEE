"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than her value of $800,000.  There is substantial room for negotiation. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  This counteroffer significantly lowers the price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  This offer is still above Alice's value, suggesting a potential win-win scenario.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the product's value while proposing a price that aligns with Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject this offer and continue exploring a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will lower her price further, especially since Bob has demonstrated a willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's previous offer, signaling a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the potential for both parties to gain from the deal.
* **Directness:** This counteroffer clearly states the desired price, minimizing ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $825000? This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my target profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's position, and her offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 away from Bob's previous counteroffer.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or the negotiations could drag on. At this point, accepting the offer is a good compromise, securing the product at a price significantly lower than the alternative (John's $1,500,000).
* **Saving Money:** Bob is still saving over $675,000 compared to buying from John."
