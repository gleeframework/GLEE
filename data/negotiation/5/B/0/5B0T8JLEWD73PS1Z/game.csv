"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $825000? This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my target profit margin.",825000.0,Alice,5,
