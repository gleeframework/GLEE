{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I would get by selling to John. I'm going to try and push for a higher price, but I'm also keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,700,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $1700000 is an improvement, I am still looking to keep the cost below $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept that, and I'm going to try one more time to reach a mutually agreeable price before I decide to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000 as a final concession. This price represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a great value for you. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this is a price you can consider, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not acceptable. I've made significant concessions, and it's clear that Bob's budget limitations won't allow him to come closer to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
