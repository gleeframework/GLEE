"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1700000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $1700000 is an improvement, I am still looking to keep the cost below $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1400000 as a final concession. This price represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a great value for you. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to reconsider.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this is a price you can consider, given my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
