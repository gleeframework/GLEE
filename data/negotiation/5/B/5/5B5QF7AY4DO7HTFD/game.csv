"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very competitive price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping for something closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit and offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great price for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
