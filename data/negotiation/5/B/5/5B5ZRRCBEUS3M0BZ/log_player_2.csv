"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Let's negotiate. Alice's offer is too high. We have room to haggle before reaching John's price."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"",

}
``` 

We start with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This price gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's $15,000 offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,200. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200

Alice is negotiating, but we can still try to get a better price. $13,200 is closer to John's offer than our target price. We should counteroffer again to see if there's more room for negotiation."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However,  $13,200 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we settle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're getting closer. This counteroffer aims to meet near the middle ground while still leaving us some potential negotiating space if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! We've negotiated Alice down to $12,800, saving us $2,200 from John's offer.  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we're happy with this price."
