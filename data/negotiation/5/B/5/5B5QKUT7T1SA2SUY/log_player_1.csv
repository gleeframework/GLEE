"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a negotiating tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $95, which is a bit closer to his valuation but still leaves me some room for profit. This should be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum asking price of $100.  I'll counter with a price closer to $95 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $90. This is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate and that we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, I'm running out of time and I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob. John's offer is the most secure option, and it meets my minimum asking price."
