"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's original worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, her latest offer of $1,312,500 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John, who is offering a price within your budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's also risky as she may reject your next counteroffer, and you could end up with no product and wasted time."
