,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring your product while also staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
