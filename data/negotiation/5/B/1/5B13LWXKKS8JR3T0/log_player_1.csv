{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This price is fair, considering its value and the potential it holds.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value and potential, reminding Bob why he's interested in acquiring it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage in a productive conversation. 
* **Avoiding Hard Deadline:** I don't mention selling to John. This avoids making Bob feel pressured and encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe the price is still a bit high. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and secure a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, hopefully finding a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I believe the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer to sell it for $900,000.  This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I begin by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Counter with a Compromise:** I offer a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still striving for a reasonable price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Positive & Collaborative Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement that works for both of us."
