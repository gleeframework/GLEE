"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I believe the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer to sell it for $900000.  This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it.
