Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $18,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives us room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$14,000 is still a good price, but I think I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer.  With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing.  I'll take the $14,500 and move on."
