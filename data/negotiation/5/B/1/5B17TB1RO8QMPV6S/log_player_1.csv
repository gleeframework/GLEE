Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to start significantly higher, aiming to capture some of the value Bob sees in the product.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" to frame the price as justified, not arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:** A high starting price leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, Alice is likely to end up with a price significantly higher than $800,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and knowledge of Bob's negotiation style, she could:

* **Go even higher:** Aim for $1,500,000 or more, maximizing potential profit.
* **Start lower:**  Offer a price closer to $800,000, prioritizing a quick and guaranteed sale."
