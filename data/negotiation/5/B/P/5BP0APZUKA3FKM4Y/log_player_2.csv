"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? It's a fair price that allows me to get a good deal while still recognizing the product's value."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer (25% reduction) leaves room for negotiation but shows you're serious about a lower price.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer establishes a lower price point in Alice's mind. 
* **Justification:** Briefly explaining your rationale can make the offer seem more reasonable and potentially encourage Alice to engage.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to consider your offer. For the product, how about we agree on $11,500? This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to your ideal price, but there's still a gap between her offer and John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further, as you might be able to secure the product for a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic, making it seem like a fair and appealing solution to Alice. 
* **Staying firm:**  While moving closer to Alice's price, you're still holding firm to a price point below her current offer and closer to John's price.
* **Positive language:** Continuing to use appreciative and encouraging language helps maintain a good negotiating relationship."
