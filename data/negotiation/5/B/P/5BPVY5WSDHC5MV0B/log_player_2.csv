``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product can bring to your business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go as high as $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $920,000 is tempting, it's still above my budget.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems we're not going to reach an agreement. At this point, it's wiser to purchase the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
