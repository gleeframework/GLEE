"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. Would you be open to considering that?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go as high as $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",920000.0,Alice,5,
