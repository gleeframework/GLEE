Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.
