Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still a bit high.  While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, you can still try to push for a lower price. There's room for further negotiation before you have to resort to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to suggest a price of $1075000 for the product. This amount aims to bridge the gap between our previous offers while still providing a fair return for our investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that's well below what you'd pay John, so it's a good deal to accept.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a slightly lower price, but the risk is that Alice will walk away from the deal altogether, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a much higher price."
