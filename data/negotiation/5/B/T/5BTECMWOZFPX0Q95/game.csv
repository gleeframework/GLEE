"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $1250000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. How about we try $1275000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. How about $1240000? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and we're getting very close. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1240000.  How about we split the difference one last time and go with $1260000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $1260000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about $1230000?",1230000.0,Bob,8,
