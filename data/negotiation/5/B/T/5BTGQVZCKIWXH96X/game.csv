"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I think we can still find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
