"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're happy with it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can do $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if that's acceptable to you!",11000.0,Alice,5,
