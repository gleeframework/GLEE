"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. I'm getting closer to a deal, but I still think $1600000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000, as I mentioned before. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
