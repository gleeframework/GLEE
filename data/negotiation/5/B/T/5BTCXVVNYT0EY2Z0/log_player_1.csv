Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming for a price closer to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still rely on John's offer of $800,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal, considering the potential buyer's valuation."
