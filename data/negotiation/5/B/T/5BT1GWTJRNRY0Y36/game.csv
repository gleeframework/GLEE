"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a significant price point, but I'm confident in the product's value.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000?  This would allow us both to get a good deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm trying to keep this purchase under $800,000.  Would you do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
