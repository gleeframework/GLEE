,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1000000 is unfortunately a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900000.  Let's aim for a win-win and see if we can close the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
