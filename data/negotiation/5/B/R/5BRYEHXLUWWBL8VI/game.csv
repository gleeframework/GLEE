"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000",1050000.0,Alice,5,
