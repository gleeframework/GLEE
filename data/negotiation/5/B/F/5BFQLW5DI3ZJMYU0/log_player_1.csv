{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $125 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm still a little higher than that.  How about $135? That's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $130 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  It's also a good price for Bob, so it's likely he'll accept."
