"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested. I understand you want a good deal, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $95. This is a good deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob has successfully negotiated a lower price from Alice. 
* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds.  Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price."
