"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Note:**  This is just the first offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. We've only had one round, and I can potentially raise the price closer to my target.
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bridge the Gap:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and my willingness to be flexible.
* **Fairness:** I'm using language that emphasizes finding a fair solution for both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $9000 for your product. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid risking losing the deal to John.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  There's a chance I could get a higher price if I reject and counteroffer, but the risk is too great.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my $10,000 goal, accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is the most sensible decision given the time constraint and the risk of losing the sale to John."
