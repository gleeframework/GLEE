"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
