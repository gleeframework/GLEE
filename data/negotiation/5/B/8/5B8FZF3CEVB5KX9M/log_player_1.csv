Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
