"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me right now.  How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I want to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This product really is worth more than that, but I'm trying to be flexible. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? I'm willing to make this final compromise to close the deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
