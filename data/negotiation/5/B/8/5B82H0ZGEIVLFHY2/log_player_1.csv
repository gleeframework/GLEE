Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Understanding Value:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup who's willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, providing me with a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower ($650,000) than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss. I will counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects that value. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** Bob's offer was very low, so I'm countering with a significant jump closer to my target price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's still closer to my starting point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay.  If he rejects this outright, I may need to consider a smaller concession or possibly move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $775,000, it's still considerably lower than my minimum price and my previous counteroffer. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  I'll continue the negotiation with another counteroffer, attempting to draw him closer to at least a $900,000 sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is still too low for me to consider.  If you're serious about purchasing, would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** I'm being more direct now about the offer being too low, but I'm maintaining a respectful tone to keep negotiations amicable.
* **Firm Counter:** I've reduced my counteroffer slightly to $900,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a firmer bottom line.
* **Justification:**  By reiterating that this price is a compromise reflecting the product's value, I'm reminding Bob of its worth and encouraging him to meet me closer to that figure. 
* **Decision Point:** This counteroffer will likely determine whether Bob is truly willing to move closer to my acceptable range. If he rejects this, I may need to seriously consider John's offer to avoid further time and potential losses."
