"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects that value. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is still too low for me to consider.  If you're serious about purchasing, would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will come down to a price that beats John's $800,000 offer.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John makes the most financial sense."
